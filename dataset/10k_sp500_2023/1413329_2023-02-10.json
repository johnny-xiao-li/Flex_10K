    "text": "General Development of Business\nGeneral\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987.  We are a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and to evolve our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, which include heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products. Since 2008, we have invested more than $10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\")  – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies’\nIQOS\nand\nZYN\nbrands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized versions of our\nIQOS\nPlatform 1 devices and consumables, and Swedish Match's\nGeneral\nsnus, as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (\"MRTPs\"). We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n.\nIn March 2008, we became a U.S. public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\nIn 2021, we laid the foundation for our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare, including the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group PLC and Fertin Pharma A/S, which provide essential capabilities for future product development. Now, through our Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, with a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, we aim to expand into wellness and healthcare areas.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired Swedish Match, a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market. The Swedish Match acquisition is a key milestone in PMI’s transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. PMI consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022, include the results of operations of Swedish Match from November 11, 2022 (acquisition date) to December 31, 2022. The operating results of Swedish Match are included in a separate segment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we also completed an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end our commercial relationship in the U.S. covering\nIQOS\nas of April 30, 2024. Thereafter, PMI will have the full rights to commercialize\nIQOS\nin the U.S.\nFor further details of our 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nand Note 13.\nSegment Reporting.\nSmoke-free products (\"SFPs\") is the term we primarily use to refer to all of our products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral nicotine. In addition, SFPs include wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories such as lighters and matches.\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing to smoke. We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our RRPs are smoke-free products that contain and/or generate far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\nOur\nIQOS\nsmoke-free\nproduct brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our\nBLENDS\n,\nHEETS\n,\nHEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro\nand\nHEETS FROM MARLBORO (\ndefined collectively as \"\nHEETS\")\n,\nMarlboro Dimensions\n,\nMarlboro\nHeatSticks, Parliament HeatSticks, SENTIA\nand\nTEREA,\nas well as the KT&G-licensed brands,\nFiit\nand\nMiix\n(outside of South Korea).  Platform 1\nwas first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014.  As of December 31, 2022, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets.\nSwedish Match already has a leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the\nZYN\nbrand name\n.\nThe Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading\n1\nheat-not-burn product.  By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 175 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by\nMarlboro\n, the world’s best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 39% of our total 2022 cigarette shipment volume.\nMarlboro\nis complemented in the premium-price category by\nParliament\n. Our other leading international cigarette brands are\nChesterfield, L&M\n, and\nPhilip Morris.\nThese five international cigarette brands contributed approximately 77% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2022. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as\nDji Sam Soe\nand\nSampoerna A\nin Indonesia, and\nFortune\nand\nJackpot\nin the Philippines.\nSource of Funds — Dividends\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law.\nDescription of Business\nAs of December 31, 2022, we managed our business in six geographical segments, a Swedish Match segment and a Wellness and Healthcare segment:\n•\nThe European Union Region (“EU”) is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries and also Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and the United Kingdom;\n•\nThe Eastern Europe Region (“EE”) is also headquartered in Lausanne, and includes Southeast Europe, Central Asia, Ukraine, Israel and Russia;\n•\nThe Middle East & Africa Region (“ME&A”) is also headquartered in Lausanne, and covers the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey and our international duty free business;\n•\nThe South & Southeast Asia Region (“S&SA”) is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes Indonesia, the Philippines and other markets in this region;\n•\nThe East Asia & Australia Region (“EA&A”) is also headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes Australia, Japan, South Korea, the People's Republic of China (\"China\") and other markets in this region, as well as Malaysia and Singapore;\n•\nThe Americas Region (“AMCS”) is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada;\n•\nSwedish Match, which reflects our fourth quarter 2022 acquisition of the company; and\n•\nWellness and Healthcare (\"W&H\"), which includes the operating results of our new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. (also known as Vectura Group Ltd.) and OtiTopic, Inc.  On March 31, 2022, we launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business consolidating these entities, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  The operating results of this new business are reported in the Wellness and Healthcare segment.\nTo further support the growth of our smoke-free business, reinforce consumer centricity, and increase the speed of innovation and deployment, in January 2023, we rearranged our operations in four geographical segments, down from the current six and as follows:\n•\nEurope Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n•\nSouth and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n2\n•\nEast Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia & Australia; and\n•\nAmericas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\nThe operations of Swedish Match and our Wellness and Healthcare segment remained unchanged.  We will report our financial results based on the new geographical segments as of the first quarter of 2023.\nIn November 2022, we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters, including our AMCS headquarters, from New York, New York, to Stamford, Connecticut.\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 1.6% in 2022 to 731.1 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 109.2 billion units in 2022, up from 95.0 billion units in 2021.  Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand,\nMarlboro\n, increased by 2.0% in 2022.\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China and/or our duty free business.  Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.\nEstimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemic-related restrictions.\nKey data regarding total market and market share were as follows:\nWe have a market share of at least 15% in approximately 100 markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the Slovak Republic, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.\n3\nDistribution & Sales\nOur main types of distribution and sales are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously:\n•\nDirect sales and distribution, where we have set up our own distribution selling directly to the retailers;\n•\nDistribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fast-moving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market;\n•\nExclusive zonified distribution, where the dedicated multicategory product distributors are assigned to exclusive territories within a market;\n•\nDistribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade;\n•\nOur own e-commerce infrastructure for product sales to trade partners and to consumers; and\n•\nOur own brand retail infrastructure for our RRP products and accessories for sales to consumers.\nCompetition\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as\nMarlboro\n,\nL&M\n,\nParliament, Philip Morris\nand\nChesterfield\n, which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we primarily sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the\nIQOS\nbrand. We also sell other smoke-free products, including those commercialized through Swedish Match. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\nThe competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; novel products which given their taste characteristics may be more commercially successful; higher tobacco product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs.\nCompetitors in our industry include British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Some competitors have different profit, volume and regulatory objectives, and some international competitors may be less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates than we are. Certain new market entrants in the non-combustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nProcurement and Raw Materials\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2022, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2022, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 16% of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States. We believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.\nGiven the global reach of our value chain, properly managing land and water resources and utilizing a geographically diversified sourcing strategy for agricultural products are priorities as we seek to increase the resilience of our production systems and minimize operational risks. We conduct a global water risk assessment annually in tobacco-growing regions to identify potential hotspots for physical water risks that require adaptation measures. Our water stewardship strategy includes guidance for applying a landscape approach to water optimization projects, protecting natural resources and recharge areas, and improving the efficiency of irrigation systems to integrate better farm water management. These business practices are intended to mitigate the risk that climate change could influence weather patterns in ways that negatively impact the quality or cost of the agricultural products used to manufacture our products.\n4\nIn addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 360 suppliers. In 2022, our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 60% of our total direct materials purchases. The four most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units, as well as susceptors used for the\nTEREA\nheated tobacco units. In addition, the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our Indonesian business.\nWe discuss the details of our supply chain for our RRPs in Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 7”) in\nBusiness Environment—Reduced-Risk Products\n.\nBusiness Environment\nInformation called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\nto this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Matters\nCustomers\nAs described in more detail in “\nDistribution & Sales\n” above, in many of our markets we sell our products to distributors. In 2022, sales to a distributor in the European Union Region and a distributor in the East Asia & Australia Region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues. See Item 8, Note 13.\nSegment Reporting\nfor more information.  We believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. In some of our markets, particularly in the European Union, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and in the East Asia & Australia Regions, a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption.\nHuman Capital\nOur Workforce\n.\nAt December 31, 2022, including Swedish Match's employees, we employed approximately 79,800 people worldwide of more than 130 different nationalities, including full-time, temporary and part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. We engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies and we have collective bargaining agreements in several of the countries in which we operate. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce.  We believe we maintain good relations with our employees and their representative organizations.\nOur Internal Transformation\n. To be successful in our transformation to a smoke-free future, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs, successfully integrate acquired businesses and innovate to become a truly consumer-centric business.  To achieve our strategic goals, we need to attract, retain and motivate the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience, competencies and skills.  Therefore, we strive to ensure the development of our existing talent while increasingly recruiting those with the expertise in areas that are relatively new to us such as digital and technical solutions. Our compensation and benefit programs are set at the levels that we believe are necessary to attract the best talent and remain competitive with other consumer product companies.\nOversight and Management\n. Our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") provides oversight of various matters pertaining to our workforce. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board is responsible for executive compensation matters and oversight of the risks and programs related to talent management. Our Code of Conduct highlights our commitment to ethical business conduct and honesty, respect, fairness in our ways of working.\nInclusion & Diversity\n. At PMI, we believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture are strategic priorities which help fuel innovation and business success. As part of our commitment to workplace diversity, in 2020, our Chief Executive Officer appointed a Chief Diversity Officer. Improving gender balance, especially in management positions, continues to be one of our priorities:\n•\nIn 2022, we achieved the global target of 40% female representation in management positions;\n•\nIn 2021, we started our Women in Leadership program to support our female talents; and\n•\nWe were the first multinational company to receive a global EQUAL-SALARY certification from the EQUAL-SALARY     Foundation  in 2019. In 2022, we were re-certified as a global EQUAL-SALARY organization for the second time, verifying that PMI continues to pay female and male employees equally for equal work everywhere where we operate. This achievement is an important milestone toward the creation of a more inclusive gender-balanced workplace and the continuation of our reputation as a top employer.\n5\nIn recognition of our efforts, we were again added to the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for transparency in gender reporting and advancing women’s equity (among the 414 companies from 11 different sectors in 45 countries, who scored at or above the global threshold established by Bloomberg L.P.).\nCreation of employee resource groups (\"ERGs\") was another important milestone to drive further inclusion at PMI. We believe these groups serve as a platform for building an enhanced sense of belonging, visibility, and greater understanding of different experiences and dimensions of diversity in our company. Currently, we have established global ERGs for race and ethnicity, LGBTQ+, gender and disability matters concerning our employees. Each global ERG is sponsored by a member of the PMI senior leadership team, to reinforce the fact that our strong commitment to Inclusion & Diversity comes from the top. In 2022, we continued to focus on the growth of our global ERGs and to expand them locally, to be able to meet the specific needs of different markets and regions.\nBy the end of 2022, our global parental leave principles were implemented in every market in which we operate, with the exception of Russia. PMI’s minimum leave principles provide primary caregivers with a minimum of 18 weeks fully paid parental leave and secondary caregivers with a minimum of 8 weeks fully paid parental leave. These global and gender-neutral guidelines demonstrate how PMI is creating a more inclusive, diverse work environment to meet the challenges and expectations of our people for the 21st century workplace.\nTo further strengthen our commitment to drive inclusion and equality, we also commissioned an independent academic study  exploring the methods organizations can adopt to drive lasting cultural change. Findings of this study informed the development of practices and programs focused on employee inclusion at PMI.\nOur Initiatives in Response to COVID-19\n. Since the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on business continuity, health and safety of our employees, and have adapted our ways of working to a new environment. We have implemented additional safety measures for essential employees in our facilities and offices. We have also enhanced remote and flexible work arrangements and digital collaboration, and related risk management, and to date, many of our employees continue to have the ability work remotely for up to 60% of their working time, where applicable.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a company with global operations in a heavily regulated industry, we are subject to multiple laws and regulations of jurisdictions in which we operate.  We discuss our regulatory environment in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\n.\nThe regulatory landscape related to environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG”) matters is rapidly evolving. We closely monitor these developments and implement initiatives addressing PMI’s priority ESG areas in line with our sustainability strategy. In particular, we are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce our carbon footprint, wastage, as well as water and energy consumption. We report externally about our climate change mitigation strategy, together with associated targets and results in reducing our carbon footprint, through CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), the leading international non-governmental organization assessing the work of thousands of companies worldwide in the area of environmental impact, including climate change.\nOur environmental and occupational health and safety management program includes policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of this management program at our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards for safety and environmental management. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to make investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report to our management the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on current regulations, the management and controls we have in place and our review of climate change risks (both physical and regulatory), environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.\nBased on current regulations, compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings, or competitive position.\nAs discussed in more detail in Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n, our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives that could result in a significant decrease in demand for our brands or by climate-related regulations that increase our cost of operation. More specifically, any regulatory requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our RRPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a\n6\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial results. Further, tightened climate-related regulation may lead to additional carbon taxation or energy price increases impacting our cost of operation. These shifts in regulation and other market trends could, amongst others, impact current deforestation rates. Availability of deforestation-free materials, could be impacted by increased demand for alternative energy sources and low-carbon fuels, such as biomass, which could result in increased sourcing costs.\nWe discuss additional information regarding regulatory matters relating to climate change in Item 7,\nClimate Change Laws and Regulations.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe disclosure regarding executive officers is hereby incorporated by reference to the discussion under the heading “Information about our Executive Officers as of February 10, 2023” in Part III, Item 10.\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 10”).\nIntellectual Property\nOur trademarks are valuable assets, and their protection and reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including\nMarlboro\n,\nHEETS, IQOS\n,\nIQOS ILUMA,\nTEREA\n, and\nZYN\nor have the right to use them in all countries in which these brands are advertised or sold.\nIn addition, we have a large number of granted patents and pending patent applications worldwide. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have registered industrial designs, as well as unregistered proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other unregistered intellectual property rights.\nEffective January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“PM USA”). The Intellectual Property Agreement allocates ownership of jointly funded intellectual property as follows:\n•\nPMI owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and\n•\nPM USA owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.\nThe parties agreed to submit disputes under the Intellectual Property Agreement first to negotiation between senior executives and then to binding arbitration.\nAn agreement reached with PM USA in 2022 relating to\nIQOS\ncommercialization rights in the U.S. includes, among other things, an agreement relating to intellectual property rights consistent with the commercialization rights for relevant\nIQOS\nproducts.\nSeasonality\nOur business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption may be lower during the winter months due to the cold weather and may rise during the summer months due to outdoor use, longer daylight, and tourism.\nAvailable Information\nWe are required to file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The SEC maintains an Internet website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, from which investors can electronically access our SEC filings.\nWe make available free of charge on, or through, our website at www.pmi.com our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

    "text": "The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \"strategy,\" \"expects,\" \"continues,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"will,\" \"aspires,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"aims,\" \"goals,\" \"targets,\" \"forecasts\" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Our RRPs constitute a new product category that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business.  Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\n. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.\nOverall Business Risks\nWe may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated information and claims.\nOur key strategic priorities are to: (i) develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and (ii) encourage and educate current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those RRPs. For our efforts to be successful, we must:\nWe might not succeed in our efforts. If we do not succeed, but others do, or if heat-not-burn products are inequitably regulated compared to other RRP categories without regard to the totality of the scientific evidence available for such products, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, actions of some market entrants, such as the inappropriate marketing of e-vapor products to youth, as well as alleged health consequences associated with the use of certain e-vapor products, may unfavorably impact public opinion and/or mischaracterize all e-vapor products or other RRPs to consumers, regulators and policy makers without regard to the totality of scientific evidence available for specific products. This may impede our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs. We cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of RRPs with scientifically substantiated information and claims. Such restrictions could limit the success of our RRPs.\nThe WHO study group on tobacco product regulation published their eighth report on the scientific basis of tobacco product regulation in May 2021. The report is based on a review of scientific evidence related to novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products, such\n8\nas electronic nicotine delivery systems (\"ENDS\"), electronic non-nicotine delivery systems and heated tobacco products (\"HTPs\") on a number of scientific topics. The report concludes by making a number of policy recommendations on HTPs and ENDS that, if implemented, could restrict both the availability of these products, and the access to accurate information about them. In August 2021, the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the \"FCTC\") Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products to the ninth session of the Conference of the Parties (\"CoP\") of the FCTC, which are not materially different from the WHO study group report.  Substantive decisions based on these reports were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled to take place in the fourth quarter of 2023.  It is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by the WHO's reports will be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\nAdditionally, any claims, regardless of merit, challenging our research and clinical data available to date, may impact the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of the RRP category and the commercialization of the RRP category in general.\nOur RRPs and commercial activities for these products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and users of nicotine-containing products, and not for non-smokers or youth. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers or youth. Nevertheless, technological, operational, regulatory and/or commercial setbacks might impact the implementation or effectiveness of youth access prevention mechanisms and surrounding infrastructure. If nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which we have no control, our reputation and credibility may suffer, the regulatory approach to our products may become more restrictive, and our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs may be significantly impacted.\nMoreover, the FDA’s premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of two versions of our Platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these authorizations from the FDA, there is no guarantee that the product will remain authorized for sale in the U.S., or whether new versions of the products (Platform 1 or other smoke-free platforms) will receive necessary authorizations, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.\nThe financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business.\nOur RRPs are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early stages of this new product category, during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of unpredictability due to shortage of key components in our supply chain, or due to geopolitical or macroeconomic events that negatively impact RRP availability or adoption, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Nevertheless, we are unable to predict whether regulators will be issuing new regulations where RRP will be equally taxed in line with other tobacco products such as ordinary cigarettes. However, if we cease to be successful in these efforts, RRP unit margins may be materially adversely affected, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nConsumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.\nThis decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and health concerns, competition, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. These factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\n. A continuous decline in the consumption of cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our smoke-free transformation.\nCigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.\nTax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax\n9\nregimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. Furthermore, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.\nIn addition, increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and \"illicit whites.\"\nEach of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, results of operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability.\nOur business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products.\nGovernmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volumes for our products in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, \"illicit whites\" and legal cross-border purchases. Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the FCTC. Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include:\nOur financial results could be materially affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands. More specifically, requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our RRPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n10\nChanges in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. Our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls and other regulations.\nWe are subject to income tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the U.S. tax system, including significant increases in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the minimum tax rate on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries could be enacted. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings.  Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. If implemented, such changes, as well as changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, or positions, could also have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings. In future periods, our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments. Furthermore, changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates.\nAs a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, certain taxing jurisdictions, including the U.S., have proposed punitive tax legislation applicable to companies doing business in Russia, which could also have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate if enacted thereby reducing our net earnings.\nBecause we are a U.S. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls and other regulations that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars or to make payments outside the country. This could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption.\nRisks Related to the Impact of the War in Ukraine on our Business\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted by the continuation and consequences of the war in Ukraine.\nIn 2022, Russia accounted for around 9% of our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, and around 7% of our total net revenues. Ukraine accounted for around 2% of our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, and around 1% of our total net revenues. Historically, we also produced finished goods in Ukraine for export and manufactured products in Russia. In 2022, as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we suspended planned investments and scaled down our manufacturing operations in Russia. In Ukraine, we have temporarily reduced operations, including closing our factory in the country.\nThe short and long-term implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for our operations in those countries are impossible to predict at this time. The likelihood of retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, including us, as a result of actions and statements made in response to the Russian invasion, including the possibility of legal action against us or our employees or nationalization of foreign businesses or assets, including cash reserves held in Russia and intangible assets such as trademarks, is impossible to predict. We are continuously assessing the evolving situation in  Russia, including: recent regulatory constraints in the market that entail very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities; and restrictions resulting from international regulations. In Ukraine, there is no way to know when and to what extent we will be able to fully normalize our operations or to what extent our workforce, facilities, inventory, and other assets will remain intact. These developments have and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\nThe conflict also continues to elevate the likelihood of supply chain disruptions, both in the region and globally, and may inhibit our ability to timely source materials and services needed to make and sell our products. For example, historically we sourced certain finished goods, production materials and components from both Russia and Ukraine, including printed materials and filters, and the invasion has, and may continue to, disrupt the availability of and impact our supply chain for these materials. These disruptions, to the extent we are unable to find alternative sources or otherwise address these supply constraints, may impact the availability and cost of our products in other markets, which would adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges. Furthermore, the imposition of various restrictions on transactions with parties from certain jurisdictions, the ban on exports of various products, and other economic and financial restrictions may adversely affect certain third parties with which we do business in Russia, such as customers, suppliers, intermediaries, service providers and banks.\nThe broader consequences of the invasion are also impossible to predict, but could include reputational consequences, further sanctions, financial or currency restrictions, punitive tax law changes, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts as well as adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets. Given the nature of our business and global operations, such geo-political instability and uncertainty could increase the costs of our materials and operations; reduce demand for our products; have a negative impact on our supply chains, manufacturing capabilities, or distribution capabilities; increase our exposure to currency fluctuations; constrain our liquidity or our ability to access capital markets; create staffing or operations difficulties; or subject us to increased cyber-attacks. While we will continue to monitor this fluid situation and\n11\ndevelop contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop, the extent of the conflict’s effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\nThe conflict may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Form 10-K, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Such risks could affect, without limitation, the achievement of our strategic priorities, including achievement of our RRP growth targets; the availability of third-party manufacturing resources; the availability of attractive acquisition and strategic business opportunities and our ability to fully realize the benefits of these transactions; our ability to attract, motivate, and retain the best global talent; and our loss of revenue from counterfeiting and similar illicit activities.\nRisks Related to Sourcing and Distribution of Products, Services and Materials\nUse of third-parties may negatively impact the distribution, quality, and availability of our products and services, and we may be required to replace third-party contract distributors, manufacturers or service providers.\nWe increasingly rely on third-parties and their subcontractors/suppliers, sometimes concentrated in a specific geographic area, for product distribution and to manufacture some of our products and product parts (particularly, the electronic devices and accessories),  as well as to provide services, including to support our finance, commercialization and information technology processes. While many of these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs, they also diminish our direct control.  Such diminished control may lead to disruption in the distribution of our products and may have a material adverse effect on the quality and availability of products or services, our supply chain, and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences, all of which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations, and our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with other partners or our own resources.\nThe effects of climate change and legal or regulatory responses related to climate change may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing environmental goals and standards and seeking business partners, including within our supply chain, that are committed to operating in ways that protect the environment or mitigate environmental impacts, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Among other potential impacts, climate change could influence the quality and volume of the agricultural products we rely on, including tobacco, due to a number of factors beyond our control, including more frequent variations in weather patterns, extreme weather events causing unexpected downtime and inventory losses, other adverse weather conditions, and governmental restrictions on trade, all of which may lead to disruption of operations at factories, warehouses and other premises.\nFurthermore, risks related to natural ecosystems degradation, decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world, biodiversity loss, water resource depletion and deforestation, which are partially driven or exacerbated by climate change, may disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers and business partners.\nThere is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change.  New  climate-related legal or regulatory requirements may lead to additional carbon taxation, energy price increases, new compliance costs, increased distribution and supply chain costs, and other expenses impacting our cost of operation. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws or regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices.\nGovernment mandated prices, production control programs, and shifts in crops driven by economic conditions may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.\nAs with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and the impacts of natural disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. Any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nBecause we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be adversely impacted by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, pandemics or conflicts.\nSome of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. In others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threats of war or acts of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. Natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory, acts of war or threats of war, or other\n12\ndevelopments could disrupt or increase the expenses related to our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities, distribution capabilities, or the energy and other utility services required to operate our factories, warehouses, and other premises. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards might not always be effective to fully mitigate their impact. In addition, such developments – including the impact on energy prices and availability in the EU and elsewhere resulting from the invasion of Ukraine by Russia – could increase costs of our materials and operations and lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, volumes, revenue, net earnings and profitability. We discuss additional risks associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and climate change above and with the COVID-19 pandemic below.\nIn certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability.\nIn addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous controls and compliance policies aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners.  Such improper or unlawful conduct (actual or alleged) could lead to litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands, and result in substantial costs.\nOur reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency fluctuations could impair our competitiveness.\nWe conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. Foreign currencies may fluctuate significantly against the U.S. dollar reducing our net revenues, operating income and EPS.  Our primary local currency cost bases may be different from our primary currency revenue markets, and U.S. dollar fluctuations against various currencies may have disproportionate negative impact on net revenues as compared to our gross profit and operating income margins.\nA sustained period of elevated inflation across the markets in which we operate could result in higher operating and financing costs and lead to reduced demand for our products.\nIncreasing inflationary pressures may result in significant increases to our expenses, including direct materials, wages, energy, and transportation costs. While we take actions, wherever possible, to reduce the impact of the effects of inflation, in cases of sustained and elevated inflation across several of our major markets, it may be difficult to effectively control the increases to our costs. Increased inflation also has and may continue to lead to interest rate increases, thereby increasing our interest expense. Increasing inflationary pressures may also negatively impact consumer purchasing power, which could result in reduced demand for our products. If we are unable to increase our prices or take other actions to mitigate the effect of increasing inflationary pressures, our profitability and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Legal Challenges and Investigations\nLitigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.\nThere is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria, range into the billions of U.S. dollars. We anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. The FCTC encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. We face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain RRP activities, including allegations concerning product classification, advertising restrictions, corporate communications, product coach activities, scientific substantiation, product liability, antitrust, and unfair competition.  While we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations, we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize RRPs and to communicate publicly. The outcomes of these matters may affect our RRP commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more markets. Also see Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.\nInvestigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of income taxes, customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors, allegations of unlawful advertising, and allegations of unlawful labor practices. We cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. See Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies—Other Litigation\nand \"Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating Results\n13\nby Business Segment—Business Environment—Governmental Investigations\n” for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and disputes relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable assets,  their protection is important to our business, and that protection may not be equally available in every country in which we operate or in which our products are sold.  If the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights globally, including through applying for, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing, where relevant, a combination of trademark, design, copyright, patent, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, are inadequate, or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, notwithstanding legal protection, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Moreover, failing to manage our existing and/or future intellectual property may place us at a competitive disadvantage.  Intellectual property rights of third parties may limit our ability to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize our products in one or more markets. Competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could divert management’s attention, be costly, disruptive, time-consuming and unpredictable and expose us to significant litigation costs and damages, and may impede our ability to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize new RRPs and improve our products, and thus have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our profitability. In addition, if, as a result, we are unable to manufacture or sell our RRPs or improve their quality in one or more markets, our ability to convert adult smokers to our RRPs in such markets would be adversely affected. See Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies—Other Litigation\nto our consolidated financial statements for a description of certain intellectual property proceedings.\nRisks Related to our Competitive Environment\nWe face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, novel products which given their taste characteristics may be more commercially successful, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs.\nCompetitors in our industry include British American Tobacco plc, Japan Tobacco Inc., Imperial Brands plc, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, China, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Some competitors have different profit, volume and regulatory objectives, and some international competitors may be less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates than we are. Certain new market entrants in the non-combustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\nOur business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions, accessibility to our products and availability of accurate information related to our products.\n14\nTo be successful, we must:\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.\nOur ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\nOur profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.\nWe may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships, and the intended benefits from our investments may not materialize.\nOne element of our growth strategy is to expand our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and/or anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position. In addition, we may not have a controlling position in certain strategic investments or relationships, which could impact the extent to which the intended financial growth and other benefits from these investments or relationships may ultimately materialize.\nOur ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent and effectively align our organizational design with the goals of our transformation.\nTo be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs, and innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. We compete for talent, including in areas that are new to us, such as digital, information technology, life sciences, with companies in the consumer products, technology, pharmaceutical and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals.\n15\nRisks Related to the Impact of a Pandemic on our Business\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be materially adversely impacted by an epidemic, endemic or pandemic, such as COVID-19.\nThe outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has created significant societal and economic disruption, and resulted in the closures of stores, factories and offices, and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution and travel, all of which have and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the ongoing or potential impact of COVID-19 or other epidemics, endemics, or pandemics.\nThe production of our RRP portfolio requires various components and materials, and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such components and materials in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements. However, some components and materials necessary for the production of our RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we have been successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic so far, the COVID-19 pandemic, or another epidemic, endemic or pandemic, may disrupt that supply, whether through regulatory enforced actions taken to contain its spread, or through other supply chain disruptions caused by such epidemic, endemic or pandemic. This could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.\nSignificant risks to our business during an epidemic, endemic or pandemic, such as the ongoing consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, also include:\nThe significant adverse effect of an epidemic, endemic or pandemic on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands.\nEach of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, results of operations, revenues, cash flow and profitability.\nRisks Related to Illicit Trade\nWe lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites,\" non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers, and counterfeiting of our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units.\nLarge quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that\nMarlboro\nis the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites\" and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers. Our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be materially adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures.\n16\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Governance\nThe failure or disruption of our information technology networks and systems, or those managed by third-party service providers or owned by our business partners and used in furtherance of PMI’s business, due to cybersecurity attacks; unauthorized attempts to corrupt or extract data; security vulnerabilities; misconfigurations; human error; or failure or inability by us, third-parties, or our business partners to adhere to cybersecurity industry best practices, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, cause reputational damage, impact our operations, result in data breaches, significant business disruption, litigation, regulatory action including significant fines or penalties, financial impact, loss of revenue or assets, including our intellectual property, personal, confidential, or sensitive data.\nWe and our business partners heavily rely on information technology networks and systems, including those connected to the Internet, to help manage business processes and operations, including the collection, storage, interpretation, and processing of confidential, sensitive, personal and other data; internal and external communications; marketing and e-commerce activities; the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products; management of third-party business relationships; engagement with governmental authorities; innovation through research and development; and other activities necessary for  business operations. Some of these information systems and networks are developed, supplied, or managed by third-party service providers that may make us vulnerable to “supply chain” style cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks, security incidents and vulnerabilities impacting PMI, newly acquired companies, our business partners, or our third-party providers, continue to dynamically evolve in sophistication and volume, making it difficult for us to predict probability, frequency, and impact severity of security incidents. Further, it may be inherently difficult to detect vulnerabilities during due diligence, for long periods of time, or soon enough to mitigate exploitation. There can be no assurance that such security incidents or vulnerabilities will not have a material adverse effect on us in the future.\nWe continue to make investments in administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to maintain information security protections in line with industry standards and best practices. We evaluate the adequacy of preventative actions to reduce security incidents on an ongoing basis.\nOur safeguards may not, however, be effective in mitigating the impact of service disruptions or other failures of these information technology networks and systems. Failure to timely respond and mitigate security incidents, could result in wide-ranging business interruptions. Such security incidents could place us at a competitive disadvantage; result in financial impacts, a loss of revenue, assets, including our intellectual property, personal or other sensitive data; result in litigation and regulatory action including significant fines or penalties; impact our operations; cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands; and result in significant remediation and other costs.\nOur or our business partners’ failure or inability to adhere to privacy, data, artificial intelligence and information security laws could result in business disruption, loss of reputation and consumer trust, litigation, regulatory action including significant fines or penalties, financial impact, and loss of revenue, assets or personal, confidential, or sensitive data.\nAn actual or alleged failure to comply with complex and changing privacy, data, artificial intelligence and information security laws and regulations under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, various United States state and federal laws, and other similar privacy and information security laws across the jurisdictions in which PMI operates, such as the failure to protect personal data; implement appropriate technological and reasonable security measures; respect the privacy rights of data subjects; provide sufficient detailed notices of personal data processing; retrieve consent and provide opt-outs; meet stringent timeframe requirements for incident reporting to regulatory authorities; comply with artificial intelligence regulations; and others, could have a material adverse effect on us, subject us to substantial fines and/or legal challenges, and/or harm our business, reputation, financial condition, or operating results. Such laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which PMI operates may vary, resulting in inconsistent or conflicting legal obligations.\nRisks Related to the Acquisitions of Swedish Match, OtiTopic, Inc. (\"OtiTopic\"), Fertin Pharma A/G (\"Fertin Pharma\") and Vectura Group Ltd. (\"Vectura\") (collectively, the \"Acquisitions\")\nAs previously disclosed in this Form 10-K, since 2021, we have acquired Swedish Match, OtiTopic, Fertin Pharma and Vectura, and have launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business consolidating OtiTopic, Fertin Pharma and Vectura: Vectura Fertin Pharma.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from the Acquisitions.\nThe successful integration of the acquired businesses and their operations into those of our own and our ability to realize the benefits of the Acquisitions, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are not in our control.\nThe risks and uncertainties relating to integrating the businesses acquired include, among other things: (i) the challenge of integrating complex organizations, systems, operating procedures, industry specific compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets of the businesses that we acquire, and the costs related to such integration efforts; (ii) the possibility that we are unable to gain access to\n17\ndifferentiated intellectual property, proprietary technology, and pharmaceutical development expertise as anticipated by these Acquisitions, and thus fail to realize our desired entry into additional smoke-free, wellness, therapeutic and healthcare platforms; (iii) the challenge of integrating the cultures and business practices of each of Swedish Match, Fertin Pharma and Vectura to our culture and business practices, which if not managed correctly, could lead to difficulties in retaining key management and other key employees; and (iv) the challenge of achieving a successful integration as a result of our affiliation to our combustible product portfolio. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Furthermore, the success of the Acquisitions also depends on Swedish Match's continued growth in highly competitive markets and on the success of the research and development efforts of Vectura Fertin Pharma, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for new products, and the ability to commercialize or license these new products developed by them.  Moreover, our combustible product portfolio may stand in the way of introducing and growing new product categories, and may prevent our business from developing a long-term sustainable ecosystem of products in the wellness, therapeutic, and healthcare categories.\nThe businesses that we acquire in the Acquisitions may have liabilities that are not known to us.\nThe businesses that we have acquired in the Acquisitions may have liabilities that we were unable to identify, or were unable to discover, in the course of performing our due diligence investigations during the Acquisitions thereof. We cannot assure you that the indemnification available to us under the respective acquisition agreements, will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the respective business or property that we will assume upon consummation of each acquisition. Furthermore, the acquisition of Swedish Match was structured as a direct purchase of shares from Swedish Match shareholders and therefore did not include an acquisition agreement or indemnification rights. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting adjustments related to the Acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have accounted for the completion of the Acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Differences between preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may occur, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and our future results of operations and financial position in combination with the businesses acquired.\nFurthermore, given the nature of the assets being acquired in the Acquisitions, we may not be able to avoid future impairments of those assets, which may also have a material impact on our future results of operation and financial position.\nPMI, Swedish Match and Vectura Fertin Pharma may be subject to uncertainties that could adversely affect our respective businesses, and adversely affect the financial results of our combined businesses.\nOur success following these Acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability and the ability of each of Swedish Match and Vectura Fertin Pharma to maintain business relationships. Uncertainty about the effect of the Acquisitions on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies of each of Swedish Match, Fertin Pharma and Vectura, may have a material adverse effect on us and/or the businesses that we have acquired through the Acquisitions. Customers, suppliers and others who do business with Swedish Match or Vectura Fertin Pharma may delay or defer business decisions, decide to terminate, modify or renegotiate their relationships, or take other actions as a result of the Acquisitions, which could negatively affect the revenues, earnings and cash flows of our company or the businesses that we have acquired. Regulatory changes may have an impact on the development and/or commercialization of products which originate from the Swedish Match or Vectura Fertin Pharma value chains, as well as our revenues, earnings and cash flow. If we are unable to maintain the business and operational relationships of Swedish Match, or of Vectura Fertin Pharma, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon combining with these companies could be adversely affected."

    "text": "The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n.\nDescription of Our Company\nWe are a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and to evolve our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, which include heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products. Since 2008, we have invested more than $10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\") – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies’\nIQOS\nand\nZYN\nbrands.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has authorized versions of our\nIQOS\nPlatform 1 devices and consumables, and Swedish Match's\nGeneral\nsnus, as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the \"Business Environment\" section of this Item 7.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we managed our business in six geographical segments, a Swedish Match segment and a Wellness and Healthcare segment:\n•\nEuropean Union (\"EU\");\n•\nEastern Europe (\"EE\");\n•\nMiddle East & Africa (\"ME&A\"), which includes our international duty free business;\n•\nSouth & Southeast Asia (\"S&SA\");\n•\nEast Asia & Australia (\"EA&A\");\n•\nAmericas (\"AMCS\");\n•\nSwedish Match, which reflects our fourth quarter 2022 acquisition of the company; and\n•\nWellness and Healthcare (\"W&H\"), which includes the operating results of our new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. (also known as Vectura Group Ltd.) and OtiTopic, Inc.  On March 31, 2022, we launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business consolidating these entities, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  The operating results of this new business are reported in the Wellness and Healthcare segment.\nTo further support the growth of our smoke-free business, reinforce consumer centricity, and increase the speed of innovation and deployment, in January 2023, we rearranged our operations in four geographical segments, down from the current six and as follows:\n•\nEurope Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n•\nSouth and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n•\nEast Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia & Australia; and\n•\nAmericas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n22\nThe operations of Swedish Match and our Wellness and Healthcare segment remained unchanged.  We will report our financial results based on the new geographical segments as of the first quarter of 2023.\nIn November 2022, we completed the relocation of our corporate headquarters, including our AMCS headquarters, from New York, New York, to Stamford, Connecticut.\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 175 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position.  We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands.  Our\nportfolio comprises both international and local brands.\nSmoke-free products (\"SFPs\") is the term we primarily use to refer to all of our products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral nicotine. In addition, SFPs include wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories such as lighters and matches.\nIn addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products (\"RRPs\").  RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Our RRPs are SFPs that contain and/or generate far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\nIQOS\nis the leading brand in our SFP portfolio.  As of December 31, 2022, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets.\nIn 2021, we laid the foundation for our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare, including the milestone acquisitions of Vectura Group plc and Fertin Pharma A/S, as noted above, which provide essential capabilities for future product development.  Now, through our Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, with a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, we aim to expand into wellness and healthcare areas.\nIn 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB, a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market.  The Swedish Match acquisition is a key milestone in PMI’s transformation to becoming a smoke-free company.  Swedish Match already has a leading nicotine pouch franchise in the U.S. under the\nZYN\nbrand name.  The Swedish Match product portfolio is complementary to our existing portfolio, permitting us to bring together a leading oral nicotine product with the leading heat-not-burn product.  By joining forces with Swedish Match, we expect to accelerate the achievement of our joint smoke-free ambitions, switching more adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to better alternatives faster than either company could achieve separately.\nFor further details of our 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nand Note 13.\nSegment Reporting\nWe use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes.  Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell.  Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix).  Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix).\nOur cost of sales consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers.  Estimated costs associated with device warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.\nOur marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products.  The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized.  As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law.\n23\nExecutive Summary\nThe following executive summary provides the business update and significant highlights from the\nDiscussion and Analysis\nthat follows.\nWar in Ukraine\nSince the onset of the war in Ukraine, our main priority has been the safety and security of our more than 1,300 employees and their families in the country. PMI has helped to evacuate more than 1,000 people from Ukraine and relocate over 2,700 others from conflict zones to locations in the country away from the heaviest fighting; provided critical aid to employees who cannot leave or who decide to remain in Ukraine; and provided those who have left the country with a range of support in neighboring countries. We are continuing to pay salaries to all our Ukrainian employees and are also providing substantial in-kind support to them and their families. In addition, we have contributed approximately $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country.\nOn February 25, 2022, in order to preserve the safety of our employees, we announced the temporary suspension of our commercial and manufacturing operations in Ukraine, including at our factory in Kharkiv.  We subsequently resumed some retail activities where safety allowed, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and began to supply the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement.  Production at our factory in Kharkiv remains suspended.\nIn 2022, Ukraine accounted for around 2% of our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume and around 1% of our total net revenues.  As of December 31, 2022, our Ukrainian operations had approximately $0.4 billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances.\nWe employ more than 3,200 people in Russia and will continue to support our employees there, including paying their salaries, while continuing to fulfill our legal obligations. We will continue to make decisions with employee safety and security as a priority.\nOn March 24, 2022, we announced the concrete steps we had taken to suspend planned investments and scale down our manufacturing operations in Russia, including: the discontinuation of a number of cigarette products; the suspension of our marketing activities; the cancellation of all product launches planned for 2022, including\nILUMA\n; and the cancellation of our plans to manufacture heated tobacco units for\nILUMA\nin Russia.\nWe are continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia, including: recent regulatory constraints in the market that entail very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities; and restrictions resulting from international regulations.\nIn 2022, Russia accounted for approximately 9% of total shipment volumes and around 7% of our total net revenues.  As of December 31, 2022, our Russian operations had approximately $2.5 billion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances, of which approximately $0.6 billion consisted of cash and equivalents held mostly in local currency (Russian rubles).\nWe recorded pre-tax charges related to the war in Ukraine of approximately $151 million in 2022 (including humanitarian efforts). This includes charges in Russia related to the cancellation of the planned launch of\nILUMA\nand the planned production of related heated tobacco units.\nThese developments above have and will continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position, and may result in impairment charges.\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\nto our consolidated financial statements as well as Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nand the \"\nTrade Policy\n\" section of this MD&A.\nAgreement with Altria Group, Inc. regarding Commercialization of IQOS\nin the U.S.\nOn October 20, 2022, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end the companies' relationship regarding the\nIQOS\ncommercialization rights in the U.S. as of April 30, 2024. As a result of PMI reacquiring these rights, effective May 1, 2024, PMI will have the full rights to commercialize\nIQOS\nin the U.S. As part of the agreement, PMI agreed to pay a total cash consideration of $2.7 billion, with $1.0 billion paid at the inception of the agreement and the remaining $1.7 billion (plus interest, at a per annum rate equal to six percent (6%)), to be paid by July 2023 at the latest.\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions.\n24\nSwedish Match Acquisition\nOn November 11, 2022, Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V. (“PMHH”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PMI, acquired a controlling interest of 85.87% of the total issued and outstanding shares in Swedish Match.  Swedish Match's operating results beginning on November 11, 2022 through December 31, 2022, are included in PMI's consolidated statement of earnings and disclosed as a separate segment.\nOn November 28, 2022, PMHH announced that it had acquired 93.11% of the shares in Swedish Match and intended to: (i) initiate compulsory redemption under the Swedish Companies Act to acquire all remaining shares in Swedish Match; and (ii) request delisting of Swedish Match’s shares from Nasdaq Stockholm.\nOn December 16, 2022, Swedish Match announced that the compulsory redemption process had been initiated. On December 30, 2022, the shares of Swedish Match were delisted from Nasdaq Stockholm, by which time PMHH had become the owner of 94.81% of Swedish Match's shares.\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.\nKT&G\nOn January 30, 2023, PMI announced a long-term collaboration with KT&G, South Korea’s leading tobacco and nicotine manufacturer, to continue to commercialize KT&G’s innovative smoke-free devices and consumables on an exclusive, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea).\nThe agreement covers fifteen years, to January 29, 2038, with performance-review cycles and associated commitments, based on volume, to be confirmed for each three-year period, to allow flexibility for evolving market conditions.\nFor further details, see \"\nAcquisitions and Other Business Arrangements\n\" section of this MD&A.\nConsolidated Operating Results\n•\nNet Revenues –\nNet revenues of $31.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by $0.4 billion, or 1.1%, from the comparable 2021 amount.  The change in our net revenues from the comparable 2021 amount was driven by the following (variances not to scale):\nNet revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 8.0%, mainly reflecting: favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") volume and device volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume and unfavorable device mix, cigarette mix and HTU mix; a favorable pricing variance, driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing, partly offset by lower device pricing and lower HTU (net) pricing; and a favorable comparison related to the Saudi Arabia customs assessments of $246 million in 2021, shown in \"Other\" and further described in the following \"\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n\" discussion.\nIn 2022, Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 8% of PMI's total net revenues.\n25\nNet revenues by product category for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are shown below:\nFollowing the Swedish Match acquisition and a review of PMI and Swedish Match’s combined product portfolio, PMI reclassified certain of its own products previously reported under its combustible tobacco product category to the newly created smoke-free product category to better reflect the characteristics of these products. This reclassification did not impact PMI’s segment reporting, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 13.\nSegment Reporting\n.\n26\n•\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n–\nThe changes in our reported diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2022, from the comparable 2021 amounts, were as follows:\nAsset impairment and exit costs –\nDuring 2021, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $216 million, representing $181 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.12 per share, related to the organizational design optimization plan, primarily in Switzerland, and the product distribution restructuring in South Korea.  The pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 20.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\n.\nSaudi Arabia customs assessment\ns\n–\nIn June 2021, the Customs Appeal Committee in Riyadh notified our distributors in Saudi Arabia of its decisions to largely reject their challenges of the Saudi Arabia Customs General Authority assessments as described in Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\n.  On the basis of these decisions and in line with arrangements with the distributors, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $246 million in the second quarter of 2021 (representing $215 million net of income tax and\na diluted EPS charge of $0.14 per share)\n.  The pre-tax charge was recorded as a reduction of net revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021, and was included in the Middle East & Africa segment results.\nAsset acquisition cost\n– In August 2021, we acquired 100% of OtiTopic, Inc., a U.S. respiratory drug development company with a late-stage dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment for acute myocardial infarction.  We accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition since the acquired in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") of the dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired.  At the date of acquisition, we determined that the acquired IPR&D had no alternative future use.  As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million (representing a $0.03 per share charge to diluted EPS) to research and development costs within marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.\nEquity investee ownership dilution\n– In 2021, our equity method investee, Medicago Inc., initiated additional rounds of equity funding in which we did not participate.  As a result, our share of holdings in Medicago Inc. was reduced from approximately 32% at December 31, 2020, to approximately 23% as of December 31, 2021.  The ownership dilution resulted in a $0.04 per share\n27\nfavorable impact to diluted EPS and income of $55 million to equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies - Third Party Guarantees\n.\nAmortization and impairment of intangibles\n–\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we recorded amortization and impairment of intangibles of $271 million (representing $227 million net of income tax or $0.15 per share decrease in diluted EPS) and $96 million (representing $78 million net of income tax or $0.05 per share decrease in diluted EPS), respectively.  The pre-tax amortization and impairment of intangibles amount in 2022 consisted of amortization expense of $159 million primarily due to increased acquired intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions in the third quarter of 2021, and an impairment charge of $112 million reflecting the impact of general economic and market conditions resulting in a reduction in future estimated cash flows on certain products within the Wellness and Healthcare segment.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nand Note 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net.\nCharges related to the war in Ukraine –\nDuring 2022, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $151 million, representing $128 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.08 per share, related to circumstances driven by the war, including machinery and inventory write-downs, additional allowances for receivables and the cost of PMI’s humanitarian efforts.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\n.\nFair Value adjustment for equity security investments –\nDuring 2022, we recorded a favorable fair value adjustment for our equity security investments in India and Sri Lanka ($0.02 per share increase in diluted EPS).  For further details, see Item 8, Note 6.\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\n.\nCosts associated with Swedish Match AB offer\n– During 2022, we incurred pre-tax costs associated with the Swedish Match acquisition of $116 million (representing $99 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.06 per share) primarily related to financing costs, derivative financials instruments and certain transaction related costs.  These pre-tax costs of $116 million were recorded in marketing, administration and research costs ($115 million expense) and interest expense, net ($1 million expense) on our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSwedish Match AB acquisition accounting related item\n– Following the Swedish Match acquisition, we recorded pre-tax purchase accounting adjustments of $125 million related to the sale of acquired inventories stepped up to fair value (representing $94 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.06 per share).  These pre-tax adjustments were recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.\nIncome taxes –\nThe 2022 Tax benefit associated with Swedish Match AB financing that increased our 2022 diluted EPS by $0.13 per share in the table above was due to a deferred tax benefit for unrealized foreign currency losses on intercompany loans related to the Swedish Match acquisition financing reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings, while the underlying pre-tax foreign currency movements fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in the consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity at December 31, 2022.  The 2022 Tax items that increased our 2022 diluted EPS by $0.03 per share in the table above were due to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to pension plan assets of $40 million.  The change in the tax rate that increased our diluted EPS by $0.03 per share in the table above was primarily due to changes in income tax reserves.\nCurrency\n– The unfavorable impact of $0.77 per share during the reporting period primarily results from the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Egyptian pound, Euro, Hungarian forint, Japanese yen and Polish zloty, partially offset by the Russian ruble and Swiss franc.  This unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.\nInterest\n– The favorable impact of $0.02 per share from interest in the table above was primarily driven by the repayment of long-term debt maturing in 2021 and 2022, and higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense in connection with the Swedish Match acquisition.\nOperations\n– The increase in diluted EPS of $0.57 per share from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:\n•\nEuropean Union: Favorable volume/mix, partly offset by unfavorable pricing, higher manufacturing costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs;\n•\nMiddle East & Africa:  Favorable volume/mix, favorable pricing and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partly offset by higher manufacturing costs; and\n28\n•\nSouth & Southeast Asia: Lower marketing, administration and research costs and favorable pricing, partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix;\npartially offset by\n•\nEast Asia & Australia: Unfavorable volume/mix and higher manufacturing costs, partly offset by lower marketing, administration and research costs;\n•\nWellness and Healthcare: Primarily reflecting investments in research and development, as well as expenses related to employee retention programs;\n•\nAmericas: Higher marketing, administration and research costs and higher manufacturing costs, partly offset by favorable pricing; and\n•\nEastern Europe: Unfavorable volume/mix, higher manufacturing costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partly offset by favorable pricing.\nFor further details, see the\nConsolidated Operating Results\nand\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nsections of the following\nDiscussion and Analysis\n.\nDiscussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nItem 8, Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In most instances, we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under U.S. GAAP.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, as well as our disclosure of contingencies. If actual amounts differ from previous estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts. Historically, aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our Audit Committee. The following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions, estimates, accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nAcquisitions -\nPMI accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting.  PMI allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess recorded as Goodwill.  The fair value of the applicable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined through established valuation techniques, such as the income, cost or market approach. PMI may utilize third-party valuation experts to assist in the fair value determination of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The determination of fair value requires management to make judgements and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated projected revenue growth, future cash flows, terminal growth rates, useful economic lives of intangible assets acquired, discount rates, royalty rates and other factors.   Certain acquired intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and PMI’s intent to continue to support and build the intangible.\nAlthough PMI believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates. Changes in assumptions related to future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.\nSee Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nto our consolidated financial statements for details of the critical accounting estimates relevant to the business combinations in the periods presented in this Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition -\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.  Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products.  Our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers.  PMI estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial.  Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for\nIQOS\ndevices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors, including historical experience, product failure rates and warranty policies.  The transaction price is typically based on the amount\n29\nbilled to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable.  Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.\nInventories -\nOur inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory.  We perform regular reviews of our inventory on hand, as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers, considering multiple factors, including demand forecasts, product life cycle, current sales levels, pricing strategy and cost trends.  If our review indicates that inventories of raw materials, components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value, we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations.\nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets Valuation -\nWe test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review.  While PMI has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, PMI elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis.  The impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair value of goodwill, we primarily use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry, supported by a discounted cash flow model.  At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our goodwill was $19.7 billion, which is related to ten geographical reporting units, each of which consists of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics, Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma and our 2022 acquisition. The acquisition of Swedish Match in 2022 is considered a separate operating segment.  For additional information, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.  The estimated fair value of each of our ten geographical reporting units, Wellness and Healthcare business and Swedish Match exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2022.  To determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method. We concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value.\nThese discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows, which are subject to changes in business conditions, such as volumes and prices, costs to produce, discount rates and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.  Since the March 28, 2008, spin-off from Altria Group, Inc., we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets.\nMarketing Costs -\nWe incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising, marketing, consumer engagement and trade promotions.  The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program.   For volume-based incentives provided to customers, management continually assesses and estimates, by customer, the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made.  For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience.  Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.\nEmployee Benefit Plans -\nAs discussed in Item 8, Note 14.\nBenefit Plans\nto our consolidated financial statements, we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries.\nWeighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n30\nWe anticipate that assumption changes will decrease 2023 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $91 million as compared with approximately $152 million in 2022, excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses of $168 million, coupled with lower service cost of $74 million, partially offset by higher interest cost of $167 million and other movements of $14 million.\nWeighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans.  A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2023 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $40 million, and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would increase our 2023 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $1 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our 2023 pension expense by approximately $37 million.\nIncome Taxes -\nIncome tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.  If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would generally result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.\nWe are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income.  If we determine, using all available evidence, that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery, a valuation allowance is recorded.  Significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions an\nd the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies\n, as applicable.\nThe effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections.  Changes in currency exchange rates, earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or future regulatory developments may have an impact on the effective tax rates.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 12.\nIncome Taxes\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nHedging -\nAs discussed below in “Market Risk,” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. For our other derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting, gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction and in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results. If we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions, gains (losses) deferred in stockholders’ (deficit) equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives.\nContingencies -\nAs\ndiscussed in Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\n, to our consolidated financial statements, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. We and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies,\nwhile it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it: (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n31\nConsolidated Operating Results\nOur net revenues and operating income by segment were as follows:\nItems affecting the comparability of results from operations were as follows:\n•\nCharges related to the war in Ukraine\n-  See Item 8, Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\nfor details of the $151 million pre-tax charges in the Eastern Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nSwedish Match AB acquisition accounting related item\n- See Item 8,\nNote 3.

This amount was included as a\n32\nreduction in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was included in the operating income of the Americas segment.  An additional amount of overpaid indirect taxes of approximately $90 million is dependent on the outcome of a challenge by the local tax authority.\nOur net revenues by product category were as follows:\nNote: Sum of product categories or Regions might not foot to total PMI due to rounding.\nFollowing the Swedish Match acquisition and a review of PMI and Swedish Match’s combined product portfolio, PMI reclassified certain of its own products previously reported under its combustible tobacco product category to the newly created smoke-free product category to better reflect the characteristics of these products. This reclassification did not impact PMI’s segment reporting, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 13.\nSegment Reporting\n.\nNet revenues related to combustible tobacco products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our cigarettes and other tobacco products that are combusted. Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include smoke-free products.\nNet revenues related to smoke-free products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes, if applicable. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of all of our products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral nicotine, also including wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories such as lighters and matches.\nNet revenues related to wellness and healthcare products consist of operating revenues generated from the sale of products primarily associated with inhaled therapeutics, and oral and intra-oral delivery systems that are included in the operating results of PMI's new\n33\nWellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma.\nPMI's heat-not-burn products include licensed KT&G heat-not-burn products.\nReferences to \"Cost/Other\" in the Consolidated Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six geographical segments throughout this\n\"Discussion and Analysis\"\nreflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs (including asset impairment and exit costs); and amortization and impairment of intangibles.  “Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to: fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region, and the Saudi Arabia customs assessment net revenue adjustment.\nOur shipment volume by segment for cigarettes and heated tobacco units was as follows:\nFollowing the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, we continue to report the volume of brands sold by RBH for which other PMI subsidiaries are the trademark owners.  These include\nHEETS\n,\nNext\n,\nPhilip Morris\nand\nRooftop.\nHeated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include our\nBLENDS\n,\nHEETS\n,\nHEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro\nand\nHEETS FROM MARLBORO (\ndefined collectively as\nHEETS)\n,\nMarlboro\nDimensions\n,\nMarlboro\nHeatSticks, Parliament HeatSticks, SENTIA\nand\nTEREA\n, as well as the KT&G-licensed brands,\nFiit\nand\nMiix\n(outside of South Korea).\nMarket share for HTUs is defined as the in-market sales volume for HTUs as a percentage of the total estimated industry sales volume for cigarettes and HTUs.\n34\nReferences to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units, unless otherwise stated.\nAs of 2022 and on a comparative basis, total industry volume, PMI in-market sales volume and PMI market share for the following geographies include the cigarillo category in Japan: the total international market, East Asia & Australia Region, and Japanese domestic market.\nReferences to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares throughout this\n\"Discussion and Analysis\"\nare our estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude China and/or our duty free business.\nEstimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemic-related restrictions.\nIn-market sales (\"IMS\") is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model.\nCentral Asia is defined as Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\nNorth Africa is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council (\"GCC\") is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nSoutheast Europe is defined as Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.\nFrom time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures.  Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers.  In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements.  Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods.\n2022 compared with 2021\nThe following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the year ended December 31, 2021.\nEstimated international industry cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume (excluding China and the U.S.) of 2.6 trillion, increased by 0.2%, driven by the EU, South & Southeast Asia and Americas Regions, partly offset by the Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and East Asia & Australia Regions, as described in the Regional sections.\nExcluding Russia and Ukraine, estimated international industry volume increased by 0.9%.\nOur total shipment volume increased by 1.6%, driven by an increase of 14.9% for HTUs, partly offset by a 0.5% decline for cigarettes.\nExcluding Russia and Ukraine, our total shipment volume increased by 3.2%, reflecting increases of 21.5% and 0.8% for HTUs and cigarettes, respectively. Our total shipment volume in the Eastern Europe Region increased by 2.7%, on the same basis.\nFor additional detail on PMI's shipment volume performance by Region, please refer to the \"Total Market, PMI Shipment & Market Share Commentaries\" sections for PMI's regional operating segments.\n35\nImpact of Inventory Movements\nThe net unfavorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements was immaterial in the year, with PMI’s total in-market sales increasing by 1.7%, or by 3.2% excluding Russia and Ukraine, both essentially in-line with the respective shipment volumes.\nOur total HTU in-market sales volume for the year was 106.9 billion units, or 86.4 billion units excluding Russia and Ukraine, representing growth of 15.6% and 21.4%, respectively.\nOur cigarette shipment volume by brand and heated tobacco unit shipment volume was as follows:\nNote:\nPhilip Morris\nincludes\nPhilip Morris/Dubliss\n.\nShipment volume for our HTU brands increased, primarily driven by the EU, Middle East & Africa and East Asia & Australia Regions, partly offset by the Eastern Europe Region.\nOur cigarette shipment volume of the following international brands increased:\n•\nMarlboro,\nmainly driven by the Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Americas Regions, partly offset by the EU Region;\n•\nChesterfield\n, primarily driven by the Eastern Europe and South & Southeast Asia Regions, partly offset by the Middle East & Africa Region; and\n•\nParliament\n, mainly driven by the Middle East & Africa Region.\nOur cigarette shipment volume of the following international brands decreased:\n•\nL&M\n, primarily due to the EU, Eastern Europe and South & Southeast Asia Regions, partly offset by the Middle East & Africa and Americas Regions; and\n•\nPhilip Morris\n, mainly due to the Eastern Europe and Americas Regions, partly offset by the East Asia & Australia Region.\nThe cigarette shipment volume decline for \"Others\" was mainly due to:\nBond Street\n(primarily Eastern Europe) and\nLark\n(mainly Japan and Turkey), partly offset by\nDji Sam Soe\n(Indonesia).\nExcluding Russia and Ukraine, our cigarette shipment volume increased by 1.8% for\nMarlboro\n, 5.6% for\nChesterfield\n, 10.3% for\nParliament\nand 6.3% for\nPhilip Morris\n, and decreased by 0.3% for\nL&M\n.\n36\nInternational Share of Market (Excluding China and the United States)\nInternational Share of Market (Excluding China and the United States, as well as Russia and Ukraine)\n37\nKey Market Data\nKey market data regarding total market size, our shipments and market share were as follows:\n38\n(1)\nFavorable Cost/Other variance includes a $246 million reduction in net revenues in 2021 related to the Saudi Arabia customs assessments.  For more details, see Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\n.\n(2)\nC\nost/Other variance includes charges in 2022 of $112 million related to an impairment charge of intangible assets, $62 million related to the war in Ukraine and $125 million of Swedish Match AB acquisition accounting related item.  For more details, Item 8, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n, Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\nand Note 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.\n(3)\nCost/Other variance includes charges in 2022 of $89 million related to the war in Ukraine and $115 million in 2022 related to costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer, offset by charges in 2021 of $216 million related to asset impairment and exit costs and $51 million\nin\n2021 associated with the asset acquisition cost of OtiTopic, Inc.  For more details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n, Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\nand Note 20.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs.\nNet revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 8.0%, mainly reflecting: favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume and device volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume and unfavorable device mix, cigarette mix and HTU mix; a favorable pricing variance, driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing, partly offset by lower device pricing and lower HTU (net) pricing; and a favorable comparison related to the Saudi Arabia customs assessments of $246 million in 2021, shown in \"Cost/Other\".\nIn 2022, Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 8% of PMI's total net revenues.\nThe unfavorable currency in net revenues was due primarily to the Egyptian pound, Euro, Japanese yen, Philippine peso, Polish zloty and Turkish lira, partly offset by the Russian ruble.\nNet revenues include $10.2 billion in 2022 and $9.3 billion in 2021 related to the sale of smoke-free products. In 2022,\nIQOS\ndevices accounted for approximately 5% of our full year smoke-free net revenues both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine.\nOperating income decreased by 5.6%.  Operating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 6.7%, which included: favorable comparisons versus the prior year period related to the 2021 Saudi Arabia customs assessments of $246 million (as noted above for net revenues), 2021 asset impairment and exit costs of $216 million and 2021 asset acquisition cost of $51 million, partly offset by the impact of 2022 costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer of $115 million, higher amortization and impairment of intangibles (primarily $112 million related to impairment charges in 2022), 2022 charges related to the war in Ukraine of $151 million and $125 million of Swedish Match AB acquisition accounting related item in 2022.  In addition to these items, operating income was impacted by: a favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume, unfavorable cigarette mix, HTU mix and device mix, and the unfavorable impact on profitability of higher device volume; and a favorable pricing variance; partially offset by higher manufacturing costs (primarily due to higher logistics costs and other inflationary impacts, partly offset by productivity); and higher marketing, administration and research costs.\nAs reduced-risk products grow as a proportion of our business, notably for\nIQOS ILUMA\nwhere unit costs of devices and both the unit costs and weight of consumables are not yet fully optimized, a temporary dilutive margin impact is likely to continue in the coming quarters.\nLike many other global companies, we are facing significant inflationary forces in the world economy.  Inflationary pressures are growing as we renew pricing arrangements, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy, and transportation costs. These inflationary pressures, including margin pressure from inflation as well as the cost of capital, could continue to grow in the upcoming quarters.\n39\nInterest expense, net, of $588 million decreased by $40 million (6.4%) primarily driven by the repayment of long-term debt maturing in 2021 and 2022 and higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense in connection with the Swedish Match acquisition.\nOur effective tax rate decreased by 2.5 percentage points to 19.3%.  We estimate that our 2023 effective tax rate will be approximately 20.5% to 21.5%, excluding discrete tax events.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 12.\nIncome Taxes\n.\nNet earnings attributable to PMI of $9.0 billion decreased by $0.1 billion or 0.7%. This decrease was due primarily to lower operating income as discussed above, partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate.  Basic EPS of $5.82 and diluted EPS of $5.81 decreased by 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.  Excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.77, diluted EPS increased by 12.9%.\n2021 compared with 2020\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021, with the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n-\nDiscussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 11, 2022.  This section is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nBusiness Environment\nTaxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  These challenges, which are discussed below and in “\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\n,” include:\n•\nregulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotine-containing products or related devices that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n•\nfiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n•\nillicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called \"illicit whites\";\n•\nintense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n•\npending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\n; and\n•\ngovernmental investigations.\nRegulatory Restrictions:\nThe tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment.  The well-known risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the FCTC, which entered into force in 2005. The FCTC has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 182 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others. The FCTC governing body, the Conference of the Parties (“CoP”), has also adopted non-binding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty.  In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products.  Similar to its previous policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\nPrior to CoP 9 that took place in November 2021, the WHO and the WHO FCTC Secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products.  The reports were noted by CoP 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to CoP 10, currently scheduled for 2023.  It is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by the WHO's reports will be implemented as the reports are not binding to the WHO Member States.\n40\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that are based on a continuum of risk where non-combustible products fall below combustible cigarettes. Product regulation should include measures that encourage and accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to enable them to make informed decisions and by applying uniform product standards to enable manufacturers to demonstrate the reduction in harmful and potentially harmful constituents, as well as the absence of combustion. Regulation should also include specific rules for ingredients, labeling and consumer communication, and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and non-combustible tobacco and nicotine-containing products. Importantly, regulation must include measures designed to prevent initiation by youth and non-smokers. We support mandated health warnings, minimum age laws, restrictions on advertising, and public place smoking restrictions. We also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade.\nCertain measures are discussed in more detail below and in the\nReduced-Risk Products (RRPs)\nsection.\nFiscal Challenges:\nExcessive and disruptive excise, sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability, due to lower consumption and consumer down-trading to non-premium, discount, other low-price or low-taxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, some of our combustible tobacco products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premium-price products and manufactured cigarettes.  We believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade, and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives, disrupt the competitive environment, and encourage criminal activity. Other jurisdictions have imposed, or are seeking to impose, levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies, such as taxes on revenues and/or profits.\nWorld Customs Organization Developments\n: In 2020, the World Customs Organization (the “WCO”) amended the harmonized system nomenclature to introduce dedicated custom codes for novel tobacco and nicotine products, including heated tobacco products, e-cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products. The amendments became effective as of January 1, 2022. These amendments are not expected to significantly impact current customs duty rates. As of December 2022, and out of 160 contracting parties to the WCO’s Harmonized System Convention, 94 contracting parties, including the EU, U.S., have notified the WCO that they have implemented the 2022 edition of the Harmonized System creating new dedicated customs codes for novel tobacco and nicotine products.\nEU Tobacco Products Directive:\nIn April 2014, the EU adopted a significantly revised TPD, which entered into force in May 2016. All member states have adopted laws transposing the TPD.  The TPD sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products, including:\n•\nhealth warnings covering 65% of the front and back panels of cigarette packs, with an option for member states to further standardize tobacco packaging, including the introduction of plain packaging;\n•\na ban on characterizing flavors in some tobacco products, with a transition period for menthol that expired in May 2020;\n•\nsecurity features and tracking and tracing measures that became effective in May 2019; and\n•\na framework for the regulation of novel tobacco products and e-cigarettes, including requirements for health warnings and information leaflets, a prohibition on product packaging text related to reduced risk, and the introduction of notification requirements or authorization procedures in advance of commercialization.\nIn May 2021, the European Commission published its first report on the application of the TPD.\nThe report identifies significant progress made due to the implementation of the TPD and where there is still room for improvement. Most notably, it finds that the EU legislation has enhanced tobacco control, contributed to protecting the health of EU citizens by providing Member States with strong rules to address the use of tobacco products in the EU. The TPD reportedly achieved the 2% reduction target of the impact assessment with decreased smoking prevalence among youth. The report also concludes that there is scope for improvement in certain areas, such as enforcement at national level, assessment of ingredients, and a better consideration for novel and emerging products.\nIn November 2021, the European Commission published the implementation roadmap to Europe's Beating Cancer Plan (the \"Plan\"). According to the Plan, a revision of the TPD is planned for 2024.\nEU Tobacco Excise Directive (\"TED\"):\nThe EU Commission is preparing a legislative proposal for the revision of the 2011 EU Tobacco Excise Directive that may include definitions and tax treatment for novel tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including heated tobacco products, e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. The proposal, after several delays, is now expected to be published during\n41\nthe first half of 2023 and adopted by the EU Council in the course of 2024. Any final amendments to TED require unanimous agreement by all EU member states, followed by transposition of TED into national legislation. The earliest potential effective date for any changes to TED, after the transposition period, is  2025.\nPlain Packaging and Other Packaging Restrictions:\nPlain packaging legislation bans the use of branding, logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font. To date, plain packaging laws have been adopted in certain markets in all of our operating segments, including the key markets of Australia, France, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Some countries, such as Canada, Denmark and Israel adopted plain packaging regulations that apply to all tobacco products, including RRPs. Other countries are also considering plain packaging legislation.\nSome countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging.  Examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages, prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients:\nThe WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol.  Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term.  In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are currently exempted from this characterizing flavor ban.  However, on November 23, 2022, the European Union Commission published a delegated directive that will end this exemption. All EU Member States are required to apply the delegated directive as of October 23, 2023, and ban the use of characterizing flavors in heated tobacco products in the European Union, impacting a significant proportion of our RRP products currently sold in the European Union. While we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business from this ban, consumer switching to non-flavored products was high in reaction to past bans on flavors in other categories and markets. We therefore believe any impact will be manageable, with consumers switching to non-flavored products partially mitigating the effect of the ban. We will actively monitor relevant developments in the European Union market. Other countries may follow the EU’s approach toward tobacco product ingredients.  Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020.  Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Brazil and Canada.\nBans on Display of Tobacco Products at Retail:\nIn a number of our markets, including, but not limited to, Australia and Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale.  Other countries are considering similar bans.\nBans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships:\nFor many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have imposed, partial or total bans on tobacco advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet.  The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\nRestrictions on Product Design:\nSome members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted non-binding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public:\nThe pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products have increased significantly in most of our markets.  Many countries around the world have adopted, or are likely to adopt, regulations that restrict or ban smoking and use of nicotine-containing products in public and/or work places, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Some public health groups have called for, and some countries, regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\nOther Regulatory Issues:\nSome regulators are considering, or in some cases have adopted, regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products.  These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities.  Other regulators are also considering generation sales bans, under which the sale of certain tobacco or nicotine products to people born after a certain year would be prohibited. On December 13, 2022 the New Zealand parliament passed a bill introducing regulatory measures restricting the sale and supply of smoked tobacco products, including reducing the number of retail outlets licensed to sell smoked tobacco products, imposing a maximum limit of nicotine content for smoked tobacco products and prohibiting the sale of smoked tobacco products to anyone born on or after January 1, 2009. These measures are limited to smoked tobacco products and do not apply to heated tobacco products and e-cigarettes.  In Mexico, a new law\n42\ncame into force on December 12, 2022 prohibiting imports and exports of certain nicotine and non-nicotine delivery and consumption systems, as well as the consumables used in those systems, including much of our RRP portfolio.  On December 16, 2022, the Federal Government enacted an implementation regulation for the tobacco control law, which includes (i) a point of sale display ban of tobacco products; (ii) restrictions on where tobacco products can be consumed, and (iii) prohibition to communicate corporate social responsibility programs funded by the tobacco industry.\nOn January 1, 2023 a law regulating the marketing of nicotine pouches went into effect in Slovakia. The regulatory framework  contains a minimum purchase legal age (18 years), a nicotine limit, and a labelling requirement. On December 6, 2022 the Dutch Government published a draft bill to ban the placing on the market of nicotine pouches in the Netherlands.  On December 16, 2022 a  notification period to the EU Commission expired for a Belgian Royal Decree to ban nicotine pouches. Based on this decree the Belgian Government could ban the placing on the market of nicotine pouches in Belgium.\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\nThe EU Single-Use Plastics Directive, which will require tobacco manufacturers and importers to cover the costs of public collection systems for tobacco product filters, under Extended Producer Responsibility (\"EPR\") schemes, entered into force on July 2, 2019. To date, some member states transposed the Directive into national legislation.  We expect remaining member states to transpose the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive into national legislation including EPR schemes by January 2023. While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\nIn some countries, including in the EU, cigarettes are subject to testing, disclosure and mandatory emissions limits for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents. In the Netherlands, several public health organizations have requested that the Dutch enforcement body enforce the requirements for maximum tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (\"TNCO\") emissions levels for cigarettes using a test method other than the method currently set forth in the EU TPD and transposed into national legislation. This request fo\nllowed publication of a report by the Dutch State Institute for Public Health & Environment, which found that all cigarette brands sold in the Netherlands exceeded the maximum TNCO levels when measured under an alternative method. While the Dutch enforcement body declined the request, the applicants have challenged that decision in pending legal proceedings in the Netherlands. While we are not parties to the proceeding and cannot predict the outcome, a decision to enforce the existing TNCO ceilings in the Netherlands using an alternative test method could impact a significant portion of the manufactured cigarettes available on the market in the Netherlands and could lead to similar actions in other EU countries.\nIllicit Trade:\nIllicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products, undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. We generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of \"illicit whites,\" which are cigarettes legally purchased in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2022.\nA number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade. In November 2012, the FCTC adopted the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (the “Protocol”), which includes supply chain control measures, such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors, enforcement  of these control measures in free trade zones, controls on duty free and Internet channels and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies. To date, 66 Parties, including the European Union, have ratified it.  The Protocol came into force in September 2018. Parties must start implementing its provisions in their national legislation. In November 2021, the second Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol decided, among others, to focus on the implementation of a framework for  global information sharing to combat illicit tobacco trade and enable the parties to exchange products' tracking and tracing information in a secure manner. We welcome this decision and expect that other Parties will ratify the Protocol.\nWe devote substantial resources to help prevent illicit trade in combustible tobacco products and RRPs. For example, we engage with governments, our business partners and other stakeholders to implement effective measures to combat illicit trade and, in some instances, pursue legal remedies to protect our intellectual property rights.\nThe tracking and tracing regulations for cigarettes and roll-your-own products manufactured or destined for the EU became effective on May 20, 2019. The effective date for other tobacco-containing products, including some of our RRPs such as heated tobacco units, is May 20, 2024. While we expect that this regulation will increase our operating expenses, we do not expect this increase to be significant.\nIn 2009, our Colombian subsidiaries entered into an Investment and Cooperation Agreement with the national and regional governments of Colombia to promote investment in, and cooperation on, anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit efforts. The agreement\n43\nprovides $200 million in funding over a 20-year period to address issues such as combating illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locally-grown tobacco.\nIn May 2016, PMI launched PMI IMPACT, a global initiative that supports third-party projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption, organized criminal networks and money laundering. The centerpiece of PMI IMPACT is a council of external independent experts in the fields of law, anti-corruption and law enforcement.  The experts are responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for PMI IMPACT grants.  PMI has pledged $100 million to fund projects within PMI IMPACT over three funding rounds.\nReduced-Risk Products (RRPs)\nOur Approach to RRPs:\nWe recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit.  Nevertheless, it is predicted that by 2025, the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 1.1 billion, despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking.\nCigarettes burn tobacco, which produces smoke.  As a result of the combustion process, the smoker inhales various toxic substances.  In contrast, RRPs do not burn tobacco and therefore contain significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (\"HPHCs\") than found in cigarette smoke.\nFor adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke, we believe that RRPs, while not risk-free, offer a much better consumer choice.  Accordingly, our key strategic priorities are to: (i) to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and (ii) educate and encourage current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products.\nWe recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to RRPs will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control, such as the willingness of governments, regulators and other policy groups to embrace RRPs as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking.  For as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke, responsible leadership of the category is critical. We aim to maintain our competitive position in the cigarette market through selective investment. As a leading international cigarette manufacturer, we will continue to accelerate this transformation by using our regulatory and commercial expertise and extensive commercial and distribution infrastructure as an effective platform for the commercialization of our RRPs and communication with adult smokers and trade partners about the benefits of switching to our RRPs.\nWhile seeking to remain competitive in the cigarette market, we are judiciously reallocating resources from cigarettes to RRPs and are streamlining our cigarette portfolio.\nWe have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. We conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our RRP platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to HPHCs and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking. We draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our RRPs. Our efforts are guided by the following key objectives:\n•\nto develop RRPs that adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke find to be satisfying alternatives to smoking;\n•\nfor those adult smokers, our goal is to offer RRPs with a scientifically substantiated risk-reduction profile that approaches as closely as possible that associated with smoking cessation;\n•\nto substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole, based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent scientists and relevant regulatory bodies; and\n•\nto advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs, including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices.\nOur RRP Platforms:\nOur product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems, which we believe are the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. We recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers. Therefore, we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences.\n44\nFive PMI-developed or improved RRP platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness:\nPlatform 1\nuses a precisely controlled heating device incorporating our\nIQOS HeatControl\ntechnology, into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. We have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform, the results of which were included in our submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).  In addition to the original version of Platform 1 which relies on a heating technology using a blade, a new version of Platform 1 is now available using induction instead of heating a blade. All studies referenced above were conducted with the blade version of Platform 1. We believe that there is full comparability between the subsequent Platform 1 versions, and therefore the data from these studies remain valid. In 2022, we also began the initial launch of a heated tobacco product using external resistive heating technology and commercialized under the\nBONDS\nbrand.\nPlatform 2\nused a pressed carbon heat source which, when ignited, generates a nicotine-containing aerosol by heating tobacco.  As a result of consumer testing feedback, the design of our current Platform 2 technology has been discontinued.  We are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment.\nPlatform 3\nis a product using nicotine salt that is composed of two parts: a consumable that contains a highly soluble encapsulated nicotine powder and a non-electric device that activates it. Once a consumable is inserted into the mechanical device, the nicotine powder is aerosolized and inhaled. The results of our pharmacokinetic study related to this version indicate this product's potential as an acceptable alternative to continued cigarette smoking in terms of product satisfaction. We are working on product modifications to enable switching by those adult smokers who are looking for better alternatives to cigarettes.\nPlatform 4\ncovers e-vapor products, which are battery-powered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a tobacco-free liquid solution.\nRecently, we developed a new e-liquid for our e-vapor mesh technology to deliver real tobacco taste satisfaction in an E-Vapor product liquid-using patented technology, where flavors and nicotine are extracted directly from the tobacco leaves and captured in a liquid solution, without having to add flavoring ingredients.\nWe also entered into a licensing agreement with Kaival Brands International, LLC in June 2022 to distribute an e-vapor product, known in the U.S. as the BIDI® Stick. The agreement grants PMI certain intellectual property rights relating to the premium e-vapor device and, potentially, other newly developed devices, to permit PMI to manufacture, promote, sell, and distribute the e-vapor device and, to the extent included, other newly developed devices in international markets outside of the U.S. We have begun commercializing an improved version of the BIDI® Stick under the brand\nVEEV now\nin Canada, U.K., Serbia and Ukraine.\nPlatform 5\ncovers Snus and Modern Oral Nicotine Pouches. Snus refers to dried loose tobacco, or snuff, which is consumed by sniffing the product through the nose,  moist loose tobacco which is put in the mouth between the lower or upper lip and gum, and Snus pouches which contain grinded tobacco, water, salt and flavors. Modern Oral Nicotine Pouches consist of white pre-conditioned pouches containing nicotine derived from tobacco. Users place a pouch between the upper lip and gum and leave it there while the nicotine and taste are being released. At the end of the use, the user can dispose of the pouch. Nicotine pouches are inherently smoke-free as they are consumed orally, and no combustion process occurs during use. They contain primarily nicotine, flavors, and a cellulose substrate. The nicotine used in the pouches is of pharmaceutical-grade like the nicotine used in medicinal products, such as gums and inhalers, while the flavors are approved for use in food in accordance with the product quality standards for nicotine pouches developed by the Swedish Institute for Standards. In 2021, PMI acquired AG Snus as well as Fertin Pharma, two companies manufacturing and/or marketing nicotine pouches. In 2022, we significantly expanded our Platform 5 products portfolio with the acquisition of Swedish Match. The acquisition also represented an expansion of our RRP presence in the United States market, where Swedish Match's\nZYN\nbrand is the leading nicotine pouch franchise.\nWe aim to expand our brand portfolio and market positions with additional RRPs.  In addition, we are continuing to use  our expertise, technology and capabilities to explore new growth opportunities beyond our current business, including products that do not contain nicotine or tobacco.\nAfter we receive the results of our scientific studies, including those mentioned above, in accordance with standard scientific practices, we share the conclusions in scientific forums and submit them for inclusion in peer-reviewed publications.\nThe research and development expense for our smoke-free portfolio accounted for 99% of our total research and development expense for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.  The research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, is set forth in Item 8, Note 15.\nAdditional Information\nto the consolidated financial statements.\n45\nCommercialization of RRPs:\nWe are developing a multicategory product approach and tailoring our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market. We focus our commercialization efforts on consumer retail experience, guided consumer trials and customer care, and increasingly, digital communication programs and e-commerce.  In order to accelerate switching to our Platform 1 products, our initial market introductions typically entail one-to-one consumer engagement (in person or by digital means) and device discounts.  These initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment, which we believe will moderate over time and further benefit from the increased use of digital engagement capabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our investments in, and pivot to, digital consumer engagement.\nAs of December 31, 2022,  PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets.\nIn 2014, we introduced our Platform 1 product in pilot city launches in Nagoya, Japan, and in Milan, Italy. Since then, we have continuously expanded our commercialization activities.\nData shows that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to our Platform 1 product switch back to cigarettes.\nWe have integrated the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities, are progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other RRP platforms, continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure and expand our commercialization activities to new products and markets. We discuss certain risks related to the commercialization and supply of our RRP portfolio in Item 1.A.\nRisk Factors\n.\nWe discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 7.\nProduct Warranty\n.  The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\nOn October 20, 2022, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end the companies' commercial relationship covering Platform 1 in the U.S. as of April 30, 2024. Thereafter, PMI will have the full rights to commercialize Platform 1 in the U.S.- the world’s largest smoke-free market, as of April 30, 2024. This agreement provides a clear path to fulfilling Platform 1 international success in a market where around 31 million adults continue to smoke.\nOur near-term planned commercialization efforts for the other PMI-developed RRP platforms are as follows:\n•\nIn late 2022, we began commercializing our\nBONDS\nproduct in the Philippines and Colombia.\n•\nFollowing the consumer test conducted in 2020, and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\n•\nWe started commercializing a new version of\nIQOS MESH\nin Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Ukraine, New Zealand and the Slovak Republic under the\nIQOS VEEV\nor\nVEEV\nbrand names.\n•\nWe launched a Platform 5 product in Sweden in January 2022, and have since launched it in ten additional markets, that is a reformulated version of the already commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the\nShiro\nbrand by our newly acquired affiliate AG Snus.\nIn addition, Swedish Match’s commercialization efforts in 2022 included the launch of several variants of existing snus and nicotine pouch brands in different markets, such as the launch of various\nZYN\nvariants in multiple markets, as well as the new\nVolt Pearls\nnicotine pouch product in Denmark, Iceland and Sweden.\nRRP Regulation and Taxation:\nRRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs, and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking and should recognize a continuum of risk for tobacco and other nicotine-containing products. Regulation, as well as industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products.\nThese regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some governments have been and may continue to be\n46\ntemporarily unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking.  By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing “Modified Risk Tobacco Products” and “New Tobacco Products” exists under the jurisdiction of the FDA. We submitted to the FDA a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application (“MRTPA”) for our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (“PMTA”) for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.\nOn April 30, 2019, the FDA determined that a version of our Platform 1 product, namely,\nIQOS\n2.4 and three related consumables, is appropriate for the protection of public health (\"APPH\") and authorized it for sale in the United States. The FDA’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of our PMTA. On December 7, 2020, the FDA reached the same determination for the\nIQOS\n3\ndevice and authorized that version of our Platform 1 product for sale in the United States.\nOn July 7, 2020, the FDA determined that the available scientific evidence demonstrates that the issuance of an exposure modification order would be appropriate for the promotion of public health and authorized the marketing of a version of our Platform 1 product, namely\nIQOS\n2.4 and three related consumables, as a \"modified risk tobacco product.\"  The FDA authorized the marketing of this product in the U.S. with the following information:\n\"AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO DATE:\n•\nthe\nIQOS\nsystem heats tobacco but does not burn it.\n•\nthis significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals.\n•\nscientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the\nIQOS\nsystem significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.\"\nWe must request and receive authorization from the FDA in order to continue marketing this product with the same modified exposure information after the present order expires in four years from the date of the orders.\nOn March 18, 2021, we submitted to the FDA a supplemental MRTPA (\"sMRTPA\") for\nIQOS\n3 requesting authorization to market this version of the device as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product with reduced exposure information like\nIQOS\n2.4. In June 2021, the FDA formally accepted and filed our sMRTPA for substantive scientific review, following a period for the public to provide comments on our application. The FDA authorized our sMRTPA for\nIQOS\n3 by issuing a Modified Risk Granted Order – Exposure Modification on March 11, 2022.\nThere are two types of MRTP orders the FDA may issue: a “risk modification” order or an “exposure modification” order. We had requested both types of orders for\nIQOS\n2.4 and an initial selection of 3 consumables' variants.  After review, the FDA determined that the evidence did not support issuing a \"risk modification\" order at this time but that it did support issuing an \"exposure modification\" order for the product. This determination included a finding that issuance of the exposure modification order is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole.  We also received an exposure modification order for\nIQOS\n3.\nOn April 29, 2022, we submitted the Annual Report for the\nIQOS\nTobacco Heating System (\"THS\") to the US Food and Drug Administration. The report included a systematic review of the literature covering publications related to the\nIQOS\nTHS between March 1, 2021 and February 28, 2022. 226 publications were identified, of which 132 were in English and contained original research or data on Heated Tobacco Products (27 from PMI or other tobacco manufacturers and 105 from independent researchers). The report concludes that, although the scientific evidence continues to develop and evolve, the extensive data reviewed confirms that while HTPs are not risk-free, the risks of HTPs are significantly reduced for both users and non-users against the well-proven risks of continued smoking, and therefore continue to support the APPH status of\nIQOS\nTHS.\nWe look forward to working with the FDA to provide any additional information they may require in order to market this product with reduced risk claims.\nThe FDA’s PMTA and MRTP orders do not mean that the agency “approved” our Platform 1 product. These authorizations are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements, and are not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.  The FDA will monitor the marketing of the product.\n47\nOn September 29, 2021, the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") issued its Final Determination (\"FD\"), Limited Exclusion Order (\"LEO\") and Cease and Desist Order (\"CDO\").  The ITC upheld the finding of infringement in the FD and found a subsequent violation.  The ITC issued a LEO prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and CDOs against Philip Morris USA, Inc. and Altria Client Services, LLC, which went into effect at the end of the 60-day Presidential review period on November 28, 2021.  We have appealed the patent issues.  Furthermore, lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in European courts and the European Patent Office.  The decision has no bearing outside the United States. For further details, see Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nSome states and municipalities in the U.S. have introduced severe restrictions for the sale of certain e-cigarettes and tobacco products, including those authorized by the FDA. We believe that such restrictions on FDA-authorized products will not advance public health and will unreasonably limit adult consumer access to products that are shown to be a better alternative to continued smoking.\nIn March 2020, the FDA issued a final rule to require new text and graphic health warnings on cigarette packs and advertisements. Heated tobacco products are technically covered by this rule, however the FDA stated that it would make product-specific decisions about health warnings when issuing or revising individual product or marketing orders. This approach would be consistent with the original marketing order for\nHeatsticks\nwhere FDA required Philip Morris Products S.A. to remove the Surgeon General’s health warning for carbon monoxide from packaging and advertising, and to use a nicotine addiction health warning instead. Philip Morris Products S.A. is committed to providing adult consumers with complete, accurate, and non-misleading information about possible health risks associated with its products. We have shared our views with the FDA on the application of the new warnings to our heated tobacco products. The final rule is the subject of litigation in the U.S. and was vacated nationwide by a federal court in November 2022. Philip Morris Products S.A. is not a party to this litigation.\nIn the U.S., tobacco and nicotine-containing products that were not commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007, are subject to review and authorization by the FDA. Manufacturers of all non-authorized products currently on the market were required to file a PMTA with the FDA by September 9, 2020.  The FDA announced on September 9, 2020 that it will prioritize enforcement against any tobacco and nicotine-containing product sold without a PMTA. On October 5, 2021, FDA published its final PMTA rule in the Federal Register, which is effective November 4, 2021.\nAll future applications will have to comply with the requirements in the PMTA rule, which is substantially similar to the version of the final PMTA rule which was posted on Advanced Federal Register on January 19, 2021.\nFDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\nCurrently, national standards in certain countries set minimum quality and safety requirements for heat-not-burn products with technical heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. These standards are mandatory in Colombia, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Tunisia, the UAE, Uzbekistan and Bahrain, and voluntary in Armenia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Philippines, Russia, Vietnam, the U.K. and Ukraine. In Japan, a voluntary standard sets minimum safety requirements for tobacco heating devices.\nFor e-vapor products (e-cigarettes) national standards setting minimum quality and safety requirements have been adopted in several markets.  These standards are mandatory in Armenia, Bahrain, China, Egypt, Jordan, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, and voluntary in Costa Rica, France, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Russia, the U.K. and Ukraine.\nCurrently, industry standards setting minimum quality and safety requirements for tobacco-free oral nicotine products (nicotine pouches) have been adopted in the U.K. and Sweden.  Both standards are voluntary.\nWe expect other governments to consider similar product standards for all novel tobacco and nicotine-containing products and encourage making them mandatory.\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated tobacco units, and e-cigarettes.  Most of the EU member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of such products, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products.  To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\nOn September 12, 2022, Norway rejected a submission for authorization of\nHEETS\nas a novel tobacco product. Norway partially transposed the\nEU Tobacco Products Directive (the “TPD”)\nunder the European Free Trade Association (\"EFTA\") agreement and introduced an authorization system for novel tobacco products following article 19 of TPD. So far Norway has not granted authorization of any novel tobacco product. E-cigarettes and tobacco free nicotine pouches have not been granted access either.\n48\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for\nHEETS\n, used with the\nIQOS\ndevice, requesting regulatory recognition of the reduction of toxic substances and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to this product compared to continued cigarette smoking.  In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we were unable to supplement the application with all the data filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence generated since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited (“PML”), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (“TGA”) seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking.  This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heat-not-burn products, one of which was our Platform 1 product.  The assessment concluded that, while still harmful to health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (“BfR”) published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%.  This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (“RIVM”) published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product.  RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.\nIn June 2018, the Korean Food and Drug Administration (“KFDA”) issued a statement on products that heat rather than burn tobacco.  The KFDA tested three heat-not-burn products, one of which was our Platform 1 product. The  KFDA confirmed that the levels of the nine HPHCs tested in the aerosol of these products were on average approximately 90% lower compared to those measured in the cigarette smoke of the top five cigarette brands in South Korea. However, the KFDA stated that it could not establish that the tested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than cigarettes. In October 2018, our Korean subsidiary filed a request with a local court seeking information underlying KFDA’s analysis, conclusions and public statements.  In May 2020, the court ordered KFDA to produce certain records.\nIn August 2018, the Science & Technology Committee of the U.K. House of Commons published a report of its inquiry into e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products. The report concluded that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco.  The report also observed that for those smokers who do not accept e-cigarettes, heat-not-burn products may offer a public health benefit despite their relative risk.  The report called for a risk-proportionate regulatory environment for both e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products and noted that e-cigarettes should remain the least taxed, cigarettes the most taxed, with heat-not-burn products falling between the two.  The U.K. Committee on Advertising Practice announced the removal of a prohibition of health claims in the advertising of e-cigarettes in the U.K. effective November 2018.\nIn November 2018, the Eurasian Economic Commission (regulatory body of the Eurasian Union consisting of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia) published the results of its commissioned study on novel nicotine-containing products, including our Platform 1 product. The study confirms significantly lower levels of HPHCs in the aerosol generated by this product compared to cigarette smoke.\nIn January 2019, scientific media published the results of the study of the China National Tobacco Quality Supervision and Test Centre (“CNTQST”) comparing the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product with cigarette smoke. The CNTQST found that the former contained fewer, and lower levels of, harmful constituents than the latter and concluded that the lower temperature of heating\n49\ntobacco in our Platform 1 product contributed to the difference. The CNTQST stated that the reduction in emissions of harmful constituents cannot be interpreted as a harm/risk reduction for smokers in the same proportion.\nIn 2020, the Superior Health Council of Belgium (“SHC”) published results of its inquiry into heat-not-burn products. The SHC concluded that heat-not-burn products, while not safe, have a more favorable toxicity profile than cigarettes.  However, in light of the uncertainty of such products’ short and long-term impacts, the toxic effects of the dual use with cigarettes, and the existence of approved smoking cessation tools, the SHC recommended that current regulations for cigarettes should apply to heat-not-burn products.\nIn June 2022, the SHC published new advice on e-cigarettes in which they confirm that e-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking cigarettes and therefore a better alternative for smokers. The SHC underlines that the vast majority of the risks of tobacco smoking are not caused by nicotine, but by the harmful substances that are released by the combustion of tobacco. Based on the cited science they call for legislation that makes a clear distinction between cigarettes and e-cigarettes, by focusing on better-informing smokers about the benefits of the lower-risk (but not risk-free) alternative, as well as on protecting non-smokers and young people.\nThe foregoing scientific findings of government agencies may not be indicative of the measures that the relevant government authorities could take in regulating our products.\nWe make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels, including our websites. From time to time, adult consumers, competitors, members of the scientific community, and others inquire into our scientific methodologies, challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our RRPs and their health effects. We are committed to a robust and open scientific debate and believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information. We seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our RRPs; nonetheless, we may not be able to prevent third-party dissemination of false, misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products.  The dissemination of scientifically unsubstantiated information or studies with a strong confirmation bias by third parties may cause confusion among adult smokers and affect their decision to switch to better alternatives to continued smoking, such as our RRPs.\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our heated tobacco units are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective, we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach.\nThere can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with RRPs or that regulation will allow us to commercialize RRPs in all markets, to communicate about our RRPs, including making scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims, or to treat RRPs differently from cigarettes.\nLegal Challenges to RRPs:\nWe face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain RRP activities, including allegations concerning product classification, advertising restrictions, corporate communications, product coach activities, scientific substantiation, product liability, and unfair competition.  While we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations, we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize RRPs and to communicate publicly.  The outcomes of these matters may affect our RRP commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more markets.\nOur RRP Business Development Initiatives:\nIn December 2013, we established a strategic framework with Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) setting out terms on how the parties would collaborate to develop and commercialize e-vapor products and commercialize two of our RRPs in the U.S. In late 2018, Altria announced that it will participate in the e-vapor category only through another e-vapor company in which Altria acquired a minority interest. In September 2019, Altria's subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”), began commercialization of a version of our Platform 1 product in the U.S. Under the agreement, PM USA was required to achieve certain milestones in order to maintain its exclusive distribution right and additional milestones to extend the agreement after the initial 5-year term.  On October 20, 2022, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end the companies' commercial relationship covering\nIQOS\nin the U.S. as of April 30, 2024. Thereafter, PMI will have the full rights to commercialize\nIQOS\nin the U.S. (For more details, please refer to Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n, and Note 18.\nContingencies\n).\nIn January 2020, we announced an agreement with KT&G, a leading tobacco and nicotine company in South Korea, for the commercialization of KT&G’s smoke-free products outside of South Korea on an exclusive basis. On January 30, 2023, we announced a renewal and extension of this arrangement. For more information, see\nAcquisitions and Other Business Arrangements\nbelow.\n50\nOther Developments:\nIn September 2017, we announced our support of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. In September 2020, our pledge agreement with the Foundation was amended. We contributed $45 million in 2020, $40 million in 2021, $17.5 million in 2022, and expect to contribute up to $35 million annually from 2023 through 2029, as specified in the amended pledge agreement. To date, we contributed a total of $267 million. The Foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent Board of Directors.  The Foundation’s role, as set out in its corporate charter, includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction, encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking, and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain.\nGovernmental Investigations\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices.  We describe certain matters pending in Russia, South Korea and Thailand in Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\n.\nIn November 2010, a World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") panel issued its decision in a dispute between the Philippines and Thailand, concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by PM Thailand into Thailand (see Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\nfor additional information). The decision concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Thai government and created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports. Thailand agreed to fully comply with the decision, but the Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues and the countries have since agreed to seek the establishment of a bilateral consultative mechanism, with the goal of reaching a comprehensive settlement of their dispute, consistent with their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement, as well as the recommendations and rulings of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.\nThe Public Prosecutor’s office of Rome, Italy, notified our Italian subsidiary, Philip Morris Italia S.r.l. (“PM Italia”), as well as three former or current employees and a former external consultant of PM Italia in July 2020 and March 2020, respectively, that it  concluded a preliminary investigation against them for alleged contravention of anti-corruption laws and related disruption of trade freedom. The Public Prosecutor alleges that the individuals involved promised certain personal favors to government officials from January to July of 2018 in exchange for favorable treatment for PM Italia, and that PM Italia lacked appropriate organizational controls to prevent the alleged actions by the individuals. BAT has filed a civil claim against PM Italia claiming vicarious liability for any wrongdoing of its former or current employees and seeking EUR 50 million in damages. The court admitted the claim as a matter of course and issued summons for PM Italia to appear as civil party in the case. The next trial hearing is scheduled for February 13, 2023. PM Italia believes the charges brought against it by the Public Prosecutor are without merit and will defend them vigorously.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nWe discuss asset impairment and exit costs related to restructuring activities in Item 8, Note 20.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nU.S. GAAP Treatment of Turkey as a Highly Inflationary Economy\nFollowing the categorization of Turkey by the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality as a country with a three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100%, the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Consequently, PMI has begun to account for the operations of its Turkish affiliates as highly inflationary, and treat the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates, effective April 1, 2022.  The impact of this accounting change was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nClimate Change Laws and Regulations\nWhile, to date, the effect of climate-related laws and regulations on PMI has not been material to our business, results of operations or financial conditions, consideration of environmental and climate-related laws and regulations is an integral aspect of PMI’s climate-related risk assessment process. To this end, we actively monitor the existing and potential impact on PMI of significant pending or existing climate change-related legislation, regulations, international accords, reporting frameworks, standards, principles, and other forms of guidance. Examples include, but are not limited to, the EU Emissions Trading System, the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the SEC’s proposed rules regarding climate-related\n51\ndisclosures, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, the European Commission Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and the International Sustainability Standards Board proposed standards.\nAcquisitions and Other Business Arrangements\nWe discuss our acquisitions in Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nKT&G\nOn January 30, 2023, PMI announced a long-term collaboration with KT&G, South Korea’s leading tobacco and nicotine manufacturer, to continue to commercialize KT&G’s innovative smoke-free devices and consumables on an exclusive, worldwide basis (excluding South Korea).\nThe agreement covers fifteen years, to January 29, 2038, with performance-review cycles and associated commitments, based on volume, to be confirmed for each three-year period, to allow flexibility for evolving market conditions.\nThe agreement gives PMI continued exclusive access to KT&G’s smoke-free brands and product-innovation pipeline, including offerings for low- and middle-income markets, that will enhance PMI’s existing portfolio of smoke-free products.\nProducts sold under the agreement will be subject to assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched, as well as PMI’s high standards of quality and scientific substantiation. PMI and KT&G will seek any necessary regulatory approvals that may be required on a market-by-market basis.\nEquity Investments\nWe discuss our equity investments in Item 8, Note 6.\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nTrade Policy\nPMI complies with all applicable trade restrictions and requirements, including sanctions, in the markets in which it operates. We have taken appropriate actions in response to the latest sanctions to ensure full compliance with the relevant restrictions.\nWe are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the U.S., EU, Switzerland, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we do business (“Trade Sanctions”), including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of State.  It is our policy to comply fully with these Trade Sanctions.\nPursuant to specific exemptions or licenses, or where sanctions do not apply to our business, PMI may make sales in countries subject to Trade Sanctions.\nWe do not do business or sell products in Iran, North Korea or Syria.\nWe sell cigarettes in Cuba under a distribution agreement. These sales are permitted by U.S. law under a License Exception for Agricultural Commodities, issued by the United States Department of Commerce (Bureau of Industry and Security), and specifically granted to our distributor.\nCertain states within the U.S. have enacted legislation permitting or requiring state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. Because we do business in certain of these countries, consistent with our policy to fully comply with Trade Sanctions and as described above, these state pension funds may have divested of our stock or may not invest in our stock. We do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares.\nPMI is also subject to various Trade Sanctions imposed by the EU and other jurisdictions.  We comply fully with these Trade Sanctions.\nOn June 24, 2021, the EU introduced sanctions regarding Belarus aimed at specific sectors of the Belarus economy, including the tobacco sector.  Subsequently, seven non-EU countries (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n52\nMontenegro, and Albania) announced that they “aligned themselves” with the majority of the EU sanctions.  Switzerland and the UK have also imposed sanctions similar in scope to the EU sanctions.\nOn August 9, 2021, the U.S. imposed blocking sanctions on certain Belarusian individuals and entities pursuant to an Executive Order, which expanded the bases for the imposition of sanctions, including, among others, by authorizing the imposition by OFAC of blocking sanctions on persons operating in the tobacco sector of the Belarus economy.  In 2021 and 2022, the U.S., the EU, the U.K., Switzerland and several other jurisdictions supplemented their respective sanctions lists by including additional Belarusian sanctions targets.\nFollowing the start of the conflict in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S., the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and other countries introduced extensive economic sanctions and export controls regarding Russia. While the introduced sanctions slightly vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they are largely aligned. The restrictions are primarily targeted at the Russian financial, banking, oil, military, aviation and marine sectors. The U.S. has also introduced a prohibition on new investment in the Russian Federation by a U.S. person, wherever located. Among sanctions targets are Russian political figures and military personnel, certain oligarchs and journalists, and companies operating in the above-mentioned sectors. Export to Russia of certain luxury goods, and goods and technology which might contribute to Russia’s technological enhancement was banned. Seven non-EU countries (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania) announced that they “aligned themselves” with the majority of the EU sanctions. The EU and Switzerland introduced additional trade restrictions banning, among many other goods, the export of certain non-tobacco materials used to produce cigarettes and heated tobacco consumables in Russia as well as related technical assistance and other related services. In addition, the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ukraine sanctioned Mr. Igor Kesaev, a non-majority shareholder of Megapolis Distribution B.V.\nThe U.K. banned the export of electronic cigarettes and similar personal electric vaporizing devices to Russia as well as related technical assistance, and financial and brokering services.  Certain countries also banned the delivery of services to Russia, such as information technology consultancy services, accounting and business and management consulting services, most with exceptions for subsidiaries of U.S., E.U., or Swiss owned companies.\nRussia introduced certain countermeasures aimed at reducing the effect of Western sanctions. Countermeasures include restrictions on export of certain goods from Russia, including tobacco-related production equipment, restrictions on lending to foreign borrowers, repatriation of dividends and transactions with securities and real estate involving companies from “hostile” countries (i.e., those which introduced sanctions regarding Russia).\nPMI continues to monitor the development of new sanctions and ensure full compliance.\n2022 compared with 2021\nThe following discussion compares operating results within each of our segments for 2022 with 2021.\nUnless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units. Estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemic-related restrictions.\nEuropean Union:\nNet revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 10.6%, reflecting: favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by higher HTU volume and device volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume, unfavorable HTU mix, and unfavorable cigarette mix;\n53\npartially offset by an unfavorable pricing variance, mainly due to lower HTU (net) pricing and lower device pricing, partly offset by higher combustible tobacco pricing.\nThe unfavorable pricing variance is impacted by the supplemental excise tax surcharge on heated tobacco units in Germany, which went into effect in 2022. The legality of the surcharge is currently being assessed in court and the obligation to pay the surcharge is temporarily suspended. PMI currently accounts for the surcharge as a reduction in net revenues and in accrued liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. The accrued liability balance will continue to increase with the continuation of the HTU selling activities and in the case of an unfavorable ruling would negatively impact PMI’s future cash provided by operating activities. The favorable ruling would positively impact future PMI’s operating results.\nOperating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 10.5%, primarily reflecting favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume, unfavorable HTU mix, unfavorable cigarette mix and the unfavorable impact on profitability of higher device volume; partially offset by an unfavorable pricing variance; higher manufacturing costs; and higher marketing, administration and research costs (including the unfavorable impact of 2022 costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer of $51 million and a favorable comparison versus the prior year period related to asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million).\nEuropean Union - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nTotal market and market share performance are shown in the table below:\nNote: Sum may not foot due to roundings.\nThe estimated total market in the EU increased by 1.1% to 484.3 billion units, primarily driven by:\n•\nItaly, up by 3.4%, mainly reflecting the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures (particularly in the first half of the year);\n•\nPoland, up by 13.0%, primarily reflecting a lower estimated prevalence of illicit trade, as well as higher border sales (largely due to the easing of pandemic-related measures); and\n•\nRomania, up by 8.2%, mainly reflecting a lower estimated prevalence of illicit trade, as well as higher border sales (largely due to the easing of pandemic-related measures);\npartly offset by\n•\nGermany, down by 5.1%, primarily reflecting the impact of excise tax-driven price increases and higher cross-border (non-domestic) purchases due to the easing of pandemic-related measures; and\n•\nthe U.K., down by 13.4%, notably reflecting the impact of increased out-bound tourism compared to the pandemic-affected prior year period.\nOur Regional market share increased by 0.9 points to 39.5%, with gains in Germany, Italy and Poland, partly offset by declines in France and Spain.\n54\nOur total shipment volume increased by 4.0% to 193.4 billion units, mainly driven by:\n•\nItaly, up by 5.8%, primarily reflecting a higher market share driven by HTUs, as well as a higher total market;\n•\nPoland, up by 17.6%, mainly reflecting the higher total market and a higher market share driven by HTUs; and\n•\nRomania, up by 36.1%. Excluding the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, total in-market sales volume increased by 27.3%, primarily reflecting a higher market share driven by HTUs, as well as the higher total market;\npartly offset by\n•\nFrance, down by 8.1%, primarily reflecting a lower total market and a lower market share.\nEastern Europe:\nNet revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 3.7%, reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, primarily driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to lower cigarette volume, lower HTU volume and unfavorable cigarette mix.\nIn 2022, Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 70% of PMI's total net revenues in the Region.\nOperating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, decreased by 13.9%, notably reflecting the impact of 2022 charges related to the war in Ukraine ($151 million) shown in \"Cost/Other\", as well as unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to the same factors as for net revenues; higher manufacturing costs (notably related to Ukraine); and higher marketing, administration and research costs; partly offset by a favorable pricing variance.\n55\nEastern Europe - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nThe estimated total market in Eastern Europe decreased by 4.4% to 358.0 billion units, primarily due to:\n•\nRussia, down by 3.6%, mainly due to the impact of price increases; and\n•\nUkraine, down by 18.3%.\nThe estimated total market in Eastern Europe, excluding Russia and Ukraine, was essentially stable at 113.3 billion units.\nOur Regional market share decreased by 0.8 points to 29.8%.  Excluding Russia and Ukraine, our Regional market share increased by 0.4 points to 26.7%.\nOur total shipment volume decreased by 7.1% to 106.3 billion units, primarily due to:\n•\nRussia, down by 6.0%, due to cigarettes and HTUs; and\n•\nUkraine, down by 30.1%, due to cigarettes and HTUs.\nIn 2022, Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 71% of PMI's total shipment volume in the Region.  Excluding Russia and Ukraine, total shipment volume increased by 2.7%.\nMiddle East & Africa:\n56\nNet revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 29.0%, notably reflecting a favorable comparison related to the Saudi Arabia customs assessments of $246 million in 2021, shown in \"Cost/Other\", favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher cigarette volume and higher HTU volume; and a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by combustible tobacco pricing.\nOperating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 67.6%, notably reflecting a favorable comparison related to the Saudi Arabia customs assessments in 2021 (as noted above for net revenues), favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by the same factors as for net revenues; a favorable pricing variance; and lower marketing, administration and research costs (including the unfavorable impact of 2022 costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer of $13 million and a favorable comparison versus the prior year period related to asset impairment and exit costs of $17 million); partly offset by higher manufacturing costs.\nMiddle East & Africa - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nThe estimated total market in the Middle East & Africa decreased by 0.8% to 557.2 billion units, mainly due to:\n•\nAlgeria, down by 16.1%, or by 6.8% excluding the net unfavorable impact of estimated trade inventory movements, primarily reflecting industry supply chain disruptions, as well as the impact of excise tax-driven price increases in the first quarter of 2021; and\n•\nTurkey, down by 6.3%, mainly reflecting a higher estimated prevalence of illicit trade, partly offset by the impact on adult smoker average daily consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, coupled with increased in-bound tourism;\npartly offset by\n•\nInternational Duty Free, up by 43.8%, primarily reflecting the impact of reduced government travel restrictions and increased passenger traffic in certain geographies.\nOur Regional market share increased by 1.6 points to 24.7%.\nOur total shipment volume increased by 6.5% to 138.6 billion units, mainly driven by:\n•\nEgypt, up by 8.2%, primarily reflecting a higher market share driven by cigarettes and HTUs;

and a favorable pricing variance, mainly due to combustible tobacco pricing.\nOperating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 5.7%, primarily reflecting: lower marketing, administration and research costs (including a favorable comparison versus the prior year period related to asset impairment and exit costs of $21 million and the unfavorable impact of 2022 costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer of $13 million); and a favorable pricing variance; partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to lower cigarette mix.\nSouth & Southeast Asia - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nThe estimated total market in South & Southeast Asia increased by 2.9% to 743.3 billion units, mainly driven by:\n•\nIndia, up by 16.8%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison versus the prior year, during which pandemic-related restrictions impacted the movement of certain products, including tobacco; and\n•\nIndonesia, up by 4.5%, mainly reflecting the impact on adult smoker consumption of the easing of pandemic-related measures, which drove growth in the tax-advantaged 'below tier one' segment;\npartly offset by\n•\nBangladesh, down by 4.0%, primarily reflecting the impact of pandemic-related restrictions on mobility during February 2022, as well as the impact of second-quarter 2022 excise tax-driven price increases;

and an unfavorable pricing comparison.\nOperating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, decreased by 10.9%, mainly reflecting: unfavorable volume/mix, primarily due to unfavorable HTU mix, lower cigarette volume, unfavorable cigarette mix and unfavorable device mix; and higher manufacturing costs; partly offset by lower marketing, administration and research costs (including a favorable comparison versus the prior year period related to asset impairment and exit costs of $88 million and the unfavorable impact of 2022 costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer of $21 million).\n59\nEast Asia & Australia - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nThe estimated total market in East Asia & Australia, excluding China, decreased by 0.9% to 292.8 billion units, mainly due to:\n•\nJapan, down by 1.5%, primarily reflecting the impact of the October 2021 excise tax-driven price increases.\nOur Regional market share, excluding China, increased by 0.8 points to 27.3%.\nOur total shipment volume decreased by 0.2% to 81.9 billion units, mainly due to:\n•\nAustralia, down by 5.1%, mainly reflecting a lower total market, partly offset by a higher market share; and\n•\nSouth Korea, down by 1.6%, primarily reflecting a lower market share;\npartly offset by\n•\nJapan, up by 0.6%, or by 3.9% excluding the net unfavorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements (primarily due to HTUs), reflecting a higher market share, partly offset by the lower total market.\nExcluding the net unfavorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, our total in-market sales volume increased by 1.9%.\nAmericas:\n60\nNet revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 4.1%, primarily reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, driven by combustible tobacco pricing; partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to unfavorable cigarette mix.\nOperating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, decreased by 8.2%, mainly reflecting: higher marketing, administration and research costs (including the unfavorable impact of 2022 costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer of $5 million and a favorable comparison versus the prior year period related to asset impairment and exit costs of $8 million); and higher manufacturing costs; partly offset by a favorable pricing variance. Volume/mix was slightly unfavorable, mainly due to unfavorable cigarette mix, largely offset by higher cigarette volume.\nAmericas - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nThe estimated total market in the Americas, excluding the U.S., increased by 1.7% to 190.8 billion units, primarily driven by:\n•\nBrazil, up by 7.6%, primarily reflecting a lower estimated prevalence of illicit trade;\npartly offset by\n•\nCanada, down by 12.8%, notably reflecting the impact of price increases and out-switching from cigarettes to e-vapor products.\nOur Regional market share, excluding the U.S., increased by 0.3 points to 34.8%.\nOur total shipment volume increased by 2.1% to 66.5 billion units, mainly driven by:\n•\nBrazil, up by 13.3%, primarily reflecting the higher total market and a higher market share; and\n•\nMexico, up by 2.5%, mainly reflecting a higher total market and a higher market share for cigarettes;\npartly offset by\n•\nArgentina, down by 2.8%, primarily reflecting a lower market share due to adult smoker downtrading to ultra-low-price brands produced by local manufacturers, partly offset by a higher total market.\n61\nSwedish Match:\nOur results for the Swedish Match operating segment for the full-year include Swedish Match's results beginning on November 11, 2022, when PMI became the owner of a majority position in Swedish Match, through December 31, 2022.  The business operations of our Swedish Match segment are managed and evaluated separately from the geographical segments.\nWe recorded net revenues of $316 million in the Swedish Match segment, with an operating loss of $22 million, primarily reflecting $125 million in an acquisition accounting-related item and $26 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles.\nWellness and Healthcare:\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. and OtiTopic, Inc.  On March 31, 2022, we launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma, consolidating these entities.  The operating results of this business are reported in the Wellness and Healthcare segment.  The business operations of our Wellness and Healthcare segment are managed and evaluated separately from the geographical segments.\nNet revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, decreased by 7.9%, primarily reflecting lower product supply revenues and lower royalties.\nThe operating loss of $258 million in 2022 included $171 million of amortization and impairment of intangibles. The remaining operating loss in 2022 of $87 million mainly reflected investments in research and development, as well as expenses related to employee retention programs.\n2021 compared with 2020\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results within each of our geographical segments for the year ended December 31, 2021, with the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n-\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 11, 2022. This section is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n62\nFinancial Review\n2022 compared with 2021\n•\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by $1.2 billion compared with 2021.  Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $1.5 billion, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.3 billion, due primarily to higher currency-neutral net earnings of $1.1 billion and lower pension plan contributions, net of refunds, of $0.3 billion, partially offset by higher working capital requirements of $1.0 billion and other movements.\nThe unfavorable currency movements primarily related to the currency impact on net earnings and represented the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, especially against Egyptian pound, Euro, Hungarian forint, Japanese yen and Polish zloty, partially offset by the Russian ruble and Swiss franc.\nThe higher working capital requirements in 2022 as compared with 2021 were primarily due to more cash used for accounts receivable in 2022 mainly reflecting the timing of sales and cash collections, and more cash used for inventory mainly reflecting stock movements related to excise tax increases, partially offset by more cash provided by accrued liabilities and other current assets mainly reflecting the timing of excise tax-paid inventory movements and excise tax payments.\n•\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $15.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by $13.3 billion from the comparable 2021 period.  This increase was due primarily to the $14.0 billion of cash used in 2022 for the Swedish Match acquisition, net of acquired cash, the 2022 cash payment to Altria Group, Inc. of $1.0 billion for PMI to reacquire the\nIQOS\ncommercialization\n63\nrights in the U.S. and higher capital expenditures.  These increases were partially offset by the $2.1 billion of cash used in 2021 for our acquisitions, net of acquired cash.  For further detail on our acquisitions and the Altria Group, Inc. Agreement, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions.\nOur capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in 2022 and $0.7 billion in 2021.  The 2022 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in smoke-free product manufacturing capacity.  We expect total capital expenditures in 2023 of approximately $1.3 billion, partly reflecting increased investments behind smoke-free product manufacturing capacity, including for\nILUMA\nand Swedish Match's portfolio.\n•\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by $15.8 billion from the comparable 2021 period.  The increase was primarily due to higher borrowings in 2022 reflecting net borrowings of $9.9 billion under credit facilities related to the Swedish Match acquisition, proceeds from long-term debt issuances of $6.0 billion and net short-term borrowings of $1.0 billion (primarily commercial paper), as well as lower share repurchases and lower repayments of long-term debt in 2022.  These increases were partially offset by higher cash usage primarily reflecting payments made after the acquisition date to acquire additional Swedish Match shares from noncontrolling interests, higher dividend payments and the purchase of the remaining stakes in our Turkish affiliates in the first quarter of 2022.  For further details on the purchases of additional Swedish Match shares and the remaining stakes in our Turkish affiliates, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions.\nDividends paid in 2022 and 2021 were $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively.\n2021 compared with 2020\nFor a discussion comparing our net cash activities (operating, investing and financing) for the year ended December 31, 2021, with the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Financial Review in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 11, 2022.  This section is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nDebt and Liquidity\nWe define cash and cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments, readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes. As a policy, we do not hold any investments in structured or equity-linked products. Our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held with institutions that have investment-grade long-term credit rating.  As part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure, we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and, at maturity, cash is paid back to PMI, and the collateral is returned to the bank.  For 2022 and 2021, the activities for such reverse repurchase agreements were not material.\nIn August 2021, we published a business transformation-linked financing framework (“Framework”), which integrates PMI's smoke-free transformation into its financing strategy.  The Framework outlines the guidelines that we will follow in issuing business transformation-linked financing instruments in the debt capital and loan markets, which may include public notes offerings, private placements, loans, and other relevant financing instruments.\nCredit Ratings\n–\nThe cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings. On November 10, 2022, Fitch affirmed our long-term credit rating at “A” and short-term at “F1”, and revised our outlook to “Stable” from “Rating Watch Negative”. On November 11, 2022, Moody’s affirmed our long-term credit rating at “A2” and short-term at “P-1”, and revised our outlook to “Stable” from “Rating(s) Under Review”. On November 11, 2022, Standard & Poor’s revised our long-term credit rating to “A-” from “A” and short-term to “A-2” from “A-1” with “Stable” outlook (previously “CreditWatch Negative”).\nAt February 10, 2023, our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows:\n64\nRevolving Credit Facilities\n–\nOn January 25, 2023, we entered into an agreement to amend and extend the term of our $1.8 billion 364-day committed revolving credit facility from January 31, 2023, to January 30, 2024.\nAt February 10, 2023, our committed revolving credit facilities were as follows:\n(1)\nOn January 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement, effective February 10, 2022, to amend and extend the term of our $2.0 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period February 11, 2026 to February 10, 2027, in the amount of $1.9 billion.\n(2)\nIncludes business transformation-linked pricing adjustments that may result in the reduction or increase in both the interest rate and commitment fee under the credit agreement if PMI achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets based on its business transformation goals.\n(3)\nOn September 20, 2022, we entered into an agreement, effective September 29, 2022, to amend and extend the term of our $2.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period September 30, 2026 to September 29, 2027, in the amount of $2.3 billion.\nAt February 10, 2023, there were no borrowings under the committed revolving credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing. Subject to market conditions, PMI currently expects to request a further extension of the terms of its $2.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility for an additional one-year period, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant revolving credit facility agreement.\nAll banks participating in our committed revolving credit facilities have an investment-grade long-term credit rating from the credit rating agencies.  We continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group, and at this time we are not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider.\nThese committed revolving credit facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral.  We expect to continue to meet our covenants.\nIn addition to the committed revolving credit facilities discussed above, certain of our subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs.  These credit arrangements, which amounted to approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and approximately $2.3 billion at December 31, 2021, are for the sole use of our subsidiaries.  Borrowings under these arrangements and other bank loans amounted to $295 million at December 31, 2022, and $225 million at December 31, 2021.\nFinancing of the Swedish Match Acquisition\n–\nIn connection with PMI’s all-cash recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\"), a public limited liability company organized under the laws of Sweden, for all the outstanding shares of Swedish Match, on May 11, 2022, PMI entered into a credit agreement relating to a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility. The facility provided for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of $17 billion, expiring 364 days after the occurrence of certain events unless extended. On June 23, 2022, PMI entered into a new €5.5 billion (approximately $5.8 billion at the date of signing) senior unsecured term loan credit agreement consisting of a €3.0 billion (approximately $3.2 billion at the date of signing) tranche expiring three years after the occurrence of certain events  and a €2.5 billion (approximately $2.6 billion at the date of signing) tranche expiring on June 23, 2027. In connection with the term loan facility, the aggregate principal amount of commitments under the 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility was reduced from $17 billion to $11 billion.  On November 11, 2022, PMI acquired a controlling interest of 85.87% of the total issued shares in Swedish Match and has acquired 94.81% of its outstanding shares as of December 31, 2022.\nPMI borrowed $8.4 billion under the bridge facility by delivering notices of borrowing for advances of $7.9 billion and $0.5 billion on November 7, 2022 and November 10, 2022, respectively. All amounts borrowed under the bridge facility will become due on November 8, 2023 unless prepaid or such maturity date is extended pursuant to the terms of the bridge facility.  On November 7, 2022, PMI also delivered notices of borrowing for advances totaling €5.5 billion under the term loan facility, of which €3.0 billion will become due on November 9, 2025 and €2.5 billion will become due on June 23, 2027 unless prepaid pursuant to the terms of the credit\n65\nagreement. On November 21, 2022, PMI repaid $4.0 billion under the bridge facility. As of December 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings under the bridge facility amounted to $4.4 billion and $1.1 billion commitments remained available for drawing.  As of December 31, 2022, the €5.5 billion (approximately $5.9 billion) term loan facility was fully drawn and remained outstanding.  The proceeds under the bridge facility and the term loan facility were used, directly or indirectly, to finance the acquisition, including, the payment of related fees and expenses.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nCommercial Paper Program –\nWe continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the U.S. and in Europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of $8.0 billion.  At December 31, 2022, we had $0.9 billion of commercial paper outstanding.  At December 31, 2021, we had no commercial paper outstanding.  The average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2022 and 2021\nwas $3.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.\nSale of Accounts Receivable\n–\nTo mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management, we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions.  These arrangements allow us to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse.  The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. We sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements, servicing and nonservicing.\nOur operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions.  The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $1.0 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.  The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 19.\nSale of Accounts Receivable\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nDebt\n–\nOur total debt was $43.1 billion at December 31, 2022, and $27.8 billion at December 31, 2021.  Our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature.  The weighted-average all-in financing cost of our total debt was 2.5% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2021.  For further details, including the fair value of our debt, see Item 8, Note 8.\nIndebtedness\n.  The amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nOn February 11, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we may from time to time sell debt securities and/or warrants to purchase debt securities over a three-year period.  During February 2023, we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur notes issuances in 2022 were as follows:\n(a) Interest is payable semi-annually on each May 15 and November 15, commencing May 15, 2023.\n(b) Interest is payable semi-annually on each May 17 and November 17, commencing May 17, 2023.\nThe weighted-average time to maturity of our long-term debt was approximately 8 years at the end of 2022 and 10 years at the end of 2021.\nCash Requirements\n– At December 31, 2022, our material short-term and long-term cash requirements for various contractual obligations and commitments primarily consisted of the following:\n•\nprincipal payments related to long-term debt and the associated interest payments.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 8.\nIndebtedness\nto our consolidated financial statements;\n•\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet (primarily short-term in nature);\n66\n•\npurchase obligations for inventory and production costs to be utilized in the normal course of business such as raw materials, electronic devices, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution, as well as capital expenditures.  These purchase obligations are expected to be approximately $3.3 billion in 2023 and approximately $1.6 billion for years beyond;\n•\nAs part of the agreement with Altria Group, Inc. for PMI to reacquire the\nIQOS\ncommercialization rights in the U.S., PMI agreed to pay the remaining cash consideration of $1.7 billion (plus interest, at a per annum rate equal to six percent (6%)) by July 2023 at the latest.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nto our consolidated financial statements;\n•\noperating lease liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, which were included in our consolidated balance sheets.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 21.\nLeases\nto our consolidated financial statements; and\n•\nother long-term liabilities mainly related to transition tax.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 12.\nIncome Taxes\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nWe utilize long-term and short-term debt financing, including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements, as part of our overall cash management strategy. Our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs. We expect that the combination of our long-term and short-term debt financing, the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities, coupled with our operating cash flows, will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements.\n•\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees, and cash requirements discussed above.\nGuarantees\n–\nAt December 31, 2022, we have guarantees of our own performance, which are primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products. There is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees. These guarantees have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on PMI’s liquidity.  In October 2020, we guaranteed an obligation for an equity method investee.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity and Dividends\nWe discuss our stock awards as of December 31, 2022, in Item 8, Note 10.\nStock Plans\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nOn June 11, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $7 billion, with target spending of $5 billion to $7 billion over a three-year period.  On July 22, 2021, we began repurchasing shares under this new share repurchase program.  From July 22, 2021 through March 31, 2022, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately $1.0 billion.  During the first three months of 2022, we repurchased 2.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $199 million.\nOn May 11, 2022, we announced the suspension of our three-year share repurchase program following the recommended public offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Swedish Match from its shareholders.  Prior to the suspension of the program, we made no share repurchases during the second quarter of 2022.  For further details on Swedish Match, see the Item 8, Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.\nDividends paid in 2022 were $7.8 billion.  During the third quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors approved a 1.6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.27 per common share.  As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $5.08 per common share.\nMarket Risk\nCounterparty Risk -\nWe predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short- and long-term credit ratings as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs. We have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days.\nWe continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.\n67\nDerivative Financial Instruments -\nWe operate in markets primarily outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world.  Consequently, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure.  We use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures.  We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nSee Item 8, Note 16.\nFinancial Instruments\nto our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.\nValue at Risk\n-\nWe use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive and foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.\nThe computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period using a \"parametric delta-gamma\" approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio.  These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average, high and low value at risk amounts during each year.\nThe significant year-over-year increase in \"average\" and \"high\" impact on the value at risk computation above was primarily due to trends in foreign currency and interest rate volatility.\nThe value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions. The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position.\nContingencies\nSee Item 3 and Item 8, Note 18.\nContingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies.\n68\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \"strategy,\" \"expects,\" \"continues,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"will,\" \"aspires,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"aims,\" \"goals,\" \"targets,\" \"forecasts\" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Our RRPs constitute a new product category that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business.  Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nand\nBusiness Environment\nof this section. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations."

(also referred to herein as the U.S., the United States or the United States of America), whose subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products including heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products.  Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nSmoke-free products (\"SFPs\") is the term PMI primarily uses to refer to all of its products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral nicotine. In addition, SFPs include wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories such as lighters and matches.\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. PMI's RRPs are smoke-free products that contain and/or generate far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.\n\"Platform 1\" is the term PMI uses to refer to PMI’s reduced-risk product that uses a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.\nBasis of presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things: pension and benefit plan assumptions; useful lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets; valuation assumptions for non-marketable equity securities; marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises significant influence (generally 20%-50% ownership interest) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, PMI acquired a controlling interest of the total issued shares in Swedish Match AB (“Swedish Match”).  The operating results of Swedish Match are included in a separate segment.  In the third quarter of 2021, PMI acquired Fertin Pharma A/S, Vectura Group plc. and OtiTopic, Inc.  On March 31, 2022, PMI launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business consolidating these entities, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  The operating results of this business are reported in the Wellness and Healthcare segment.  For further details on these acquisitions, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nand Note 13.\nSegment Reporting\n.\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.  Following the Swedish Match acquisition and a review of PMI and Swedish Match’s combined product portfolio, PMI reclassified certain of its own products previously reported under its combustible tobacco product category to the newly created smoke-free product category to better reflect the characteristics of these products. This reclassification did not impact PMI’s segment reporting, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.  For further details, see Note 13.\nSegment Reporting\n.  During the first quarter of 2022, one of Fertin Pharma's product lines was moved from the Wellness and Healthcare segment to the European Union segment.  For further details, see Note 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.  The change did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.\n77\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nAcquisitions\nPMI uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses.  Under the acquisition method, PMI’s consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition.  PMI allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill.  The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date.  Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statement of earnings.  Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nIf PMI determines that assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded.  In an asset acquisition, acquired in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") with no alternative future use is charged to expense.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nDepreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated primarily over periods ranging from\n3\nto\n15\nyears, and buildings and building improvements primarily over periods up to\n40\nyears.\nEmployee benefit plans\nPMI provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance).  PMI records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified under U.S. GAAP.  PMI recognizes the funded status of its defined pension and postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets.  The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the benefit obligation.  PMI measures the plan assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year.  For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.  For the postretirement health care plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.  Any plan with an overfunded status is recognized as an asset, and any plan with an underfunded status is recognized as a liability.  Any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs are recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes.  PMI elects to recognize actuarial gains/(losses) using the corridor approach.\nFair value measurements\nPMI follows ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\nwith respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.  The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n78\nForeign currency translation\nPMI translates the results of operations of its subsidiaries and affiliates using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period.  Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders’ (deficit) equity.  In addition, some of PMI’s subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, and to the extent those are not designated as net investment hedges, these assets and liabilities generate transaction gains and losses when translated into their respective functional currencies.\nGoodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation\nPMI tests goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review.  PMI performs its annual impairment analysis in the second quarter of each year.  The impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired.\nHedging instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet or in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.  Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are reclassified to the consolidated statements of earnings, into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction, in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item.  Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nPMI reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  PMI performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, PMI groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the lower of carrying value or estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal.\nImpairment of investment in non-marketable equity securities\nNon-marketable equity securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews during which PMI considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investees' fair value.  Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security’s fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nImpairment of equity method investments\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary.  PMI determines whether a loss is other than temporary by considering the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the equity investment has been less than the carrying amount, the financial condition of the equity investment, and the intent to retain the investment for a period of time is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are provided on all earnings for jurisdictions outside the United States.  These provisions, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.  PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of earnings.  PMI recognizes income taxes associated with Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\n79\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories.  It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\nLeases\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Finance lease expense is amortized based on production activity or the lease term.   Lease expense is recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item.  At lease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its leases.  The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.  Certain of PMI’s leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage.  These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs.  PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\nMarketing costs\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, in-store display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives.  Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are expensed as incurred.  Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization.  For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\nRevenue recognition\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods.  PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer’s receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI’s right to payment for those products and the customer’s ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI’s performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer.  PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract.  The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable.  Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.  PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes.  Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.\nResearch and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development\n(\"IPR&D\")\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&D acquired is initially capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the projects.  Upon completion, a determination as to the useful life is performed and the intangible asset is accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset.  Both the indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if indicators exist.  In an asset acquisition, the initial cost to acquire the IPR&D is expensed in the consolidated statements of earnings when the project has no alternative future use.  PMI records these costs within marketing, administration and research costs in its consolidated statements of earnings.\n80\nStock-based compensation\nPMI measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes the compensation costs over the service periods for awards expected to vest.  PMI’s accounting policy is to estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust the expense when it is no longer probable that the employee will fulfill the service condition.  For further details, see Note 10.\nStock Plans\n.\nAcquisitions:\nTransactions With Noncontrolling Interests\nTurkey\n– In the first quarter of 2022, PMI acquired the remaining\n25\n% stake of its holding in Philip Morris Tütün Mamulleri Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş. (\"PMTM\") (formerly Philsa Philip Morris Sabancı Sigara ve Tütüncülük Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş.) and\n24.75\n% stake in Philip Morris Pazarlama ve Satış A.Ş. (\"PMPS\") (formerly Philip Morris SA, Philip Morris Sabancı Pazarlama ve Satış A.Ş.) from its Turkish partners, Sabanci Holding for a total acquisition price including transaction costs and remaining dividend entitlements of approximately $\n223\nmillion. As a result of this acquisition, PMI owned\n100\n% of these Turkish subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. The purchase of the remaining stakes in these holdings resulted in a decrease to PMI's additional paid-in capital of $\n30\nmillion and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive losses of $\n171\nmillion primarily following the reclassification of accumulated currency translation losses from noncontrolling interests to PMI’s accumulated other comprehensive losses during the first quarter of 2022.\nIn January 2023, PMI sold the acquired stakes of its holdings in PMTM and PMPS to Pioneers Tutun Yatirim Anonim Sirketi (“Pioneers”) for a consideration of approximately $\n205\nmillion plus remaining dividend entitlements.  The transaction will be reflected in PMI's financial statements in 2023.\nBusiness Combinations\nSwedish Match AB\n– On November 11, 2022 (the acquisition date), Philip Morris Holland Holdings B.V. (“PMHH”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PMI, acquired a controlling interest of\n85.87\n% of the total issued shares in Swedish Match AB (“Swedish Match”) and has acquired\n94.81\n% of its outstanding shares as of December 31, 2022.  The shares were acquired through acceptances of the tender offer and a series of open market and over-the-counter purchases. PMI funded the acquisition through cash on-hand and debt proceeds, as described in Note 8.\nIndebtedness.\nThe aggregate cash paid as of the acquisition date was $\n14,460\nmillion (or $\n13,976\nmillion net of cash acquired), which was included in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The cash paid in connection with the additional purchases of the noncontrolling interests after the acquisition date amounted to $\n1,495\nmillion and was included in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nSwedish Match is a market leader in oral nicotine delivery with a significant presence in the United States market.\nThe acquisition will accelerate PMI’s transformation to become a smoke-free company with a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn, and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine, with the potential for accelerated international expansion.\n81\nDue to the timing of the acquisition, and limited access to detailed and disaggregated financial information of Swedish Match, the purchase price allocation is preliminary and it is likely subject to change, including the valuation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, income taxes and legal contingencies among other items.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\nThe total fair value step-up adjustment for inventories was $\n146\nmillion, of which $\n125\nmillion was recognized in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the remaining balance expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2023.\nThe fair value of long-term debt was determined using readily available market prices as of the acquisition date and the total purchase price adjustment of $(\n102\n) million is being amortized as an increase to interest expense, net over the lives of the related debt.\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies in the U.S. and intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition.  The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nIdentifiable intangible assets of Swedish Match consist of:\nThe significant assumptions used in determining the preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets included royalty rates, revenue growth rates, profit margins, customer attrition rate and discount rates.\nTrademarks primarily relate to $\n2,077\nmillion for the\nZYN\ntrademark, which has been determined to have an indefinite life due to the fast growth and the leading position of the brand in the market.  All other trademarks have been preliminarily determined to have a\n20\nyears useful life. The preliminary fair values of the trademarks have been determined using the relief from royalty method supported by revenue growth rates assumptions and royalty rates benchmarking analysis at product category level (smoke-free brands, including\n82\nZYN\n, cigar brands and lights).  In 2023, during the measurement period, the useful life, revenue growth rate and the royalty rate of each individual trademark will be reassessed to determine its final purchase price.\nDeveloped technology, including patents, relates to the nicotine pouch technology of $\n367\nmillion.  The patent has been assigned a useful life of\n10\nyears, which is in line with the patent's protection. The preliminary fair value of the patent has been determined using the relief from royalty method.\nCustomer relationships have been valued separately by geographic locations, namely for the US market, Scandinavia, and other markets using the multiple periods excess earnings method, preliminarily reflecting a general market attrition rate for retail and revenue allocation and profit margin assumptions by customer type, which will be further assessed during the measurement period.\nPMI consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022, include $\n316\nmillion of net revenues and $(\n26\n) million of net losses associated with the results of operations of Swedish Match from the acquisition date to December 31, 2022. The operating results of Swedish Match are included in a separate segment.\nAcquisition related transaction costs, which were comprised primarily of regulatory, financial advisory and legal fees, totaled $\n59\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022, and were included in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings. Bridge and term loan credit agreement related fees associated with the issuance of debt amounted to $\n54\nmillion, of which $\n37\nmillion were capitalized at the acquisition date.  The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was based on the tender offer as of the acquisition date.\nPMI’s approval of the acquisition by the European Commission, under the EU Merger Regulation, was subject to PMHH’s divestiture of Swedish Match’s subsidiary, SMD Logistics AB, following the completion of the offer to tender all shares in Swedish Match to PMHH. As a result, these assets have been accounted for as assets held for sale and included within other current assets and other accrued liabilities in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022.\nThe unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and was based on the historical financial information of PMI and Swedish Match. In order to reflect the occurrence of the acquisition on January 1, 2021, as required, the unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to reflect the following:\n•\nincremental amortization expense to be incurred based on the current preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired;\n•\nincremental cost of products sold related to the fair value adjustments associated with acquisition date inventory;\n•\nadditional interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition, including the effects of the related derivative financial instruments designated to hedge interest rate risks as well as economic hedges;\n•\nreclassification of non-recurring acquisition-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, to the year ended December 31, 2021;\n•\nimpact of a deferred tax cost of $\n430\nmillion in 2022 and $\n321\nmillion in 2021 related to the theoretical unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans related to the acquisition financing. These theoretical unrealized pre-tax foreign currency movements were fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in PMI's consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity, while the corresponding deferred tax impacts were reflected in PMI's consolidated statements of earnings; and\n•\nother immaterial items (i.e., the alignment of accounting policies from IFRS to US GAAP.)\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is not a projection of future results of operations of the combined company, nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is as follows:\n83\nAG Snus\n- On May 6, 2021, PMI acquired\n100\n% of AG Snus Aktieselskab (\"AG Snus\"), a company based in Denmark, and its Swedish subsidiary Tobacco House of Sweden AB fully owned by AG Snus, which operates in the oral tobacco (i.e. snus) and modern oral (i.e. nicotine pouches) product categories. The purchase price was $\n28\nmillion in cash, net of cash acquired, with additional contingent payments of up to $\n10\nmillion, primarily relating to product development and performance targets over a less than\ntwo-year\nperiod.  In the fourth quarter of 2022, the additional contingent payment was settled for $\n9\nmillion.  The operating results of AG Snus are included in the European Union segment, and were not material.\nFertin Pharma\n– On September 15, 2021, PMI acquired\n100\n% of Fertin Pharma A/S (“Fertin Pharma”), a company based in Denmark. Fertin Pharma is a developer and manufacturer of pharmaceutical and well-being products based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems. The acquisition was funded with existing cash. The total consideration of $\n821\nmillion (DKK\n5.2\nbillion) included cash of $\n580\nmillion and the payment of $\n241\nmillion related to the settlement of Fertin Pharma’s indebtedness. The purchase price of $\n821\nmillion was allocated to cash ($\n24\nmillion), current assets including receivables and inventories ($\n69\nmillion), non-current assets including property, plant and equipment ($\n228\nmillion), goodwill ($\n378\nmillion), and other intangible assets ($\n245\nmillion, which primarily consisted of customer relationships, developed technology, and in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\")), partially offset by current liabilities ($\n44\nmillion, which  primarily consisted of accrued liabilities and accounts payable) and non-current liabilities ($\n79\nmillion, primarily deferred income tax). Goodwill is primarily attributable to future growth opportunities provided by acquired R&D capabilities and any intangibles that did not qualify for separate recognition.  The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.  The amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of\n8\nto\n19\nyears.  During 2022, PMI did not record any measurement period adjustments to the purchase price allocation.  The final purchase price allocation was reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\nVectura\n– During the third quarter and up to September 15, 2021, PMI acquired a controlling interest of\n74.77\n% of the total issued shares in Vectura Group plc (“Vectura”), an inhaled therapeutics company based in the United Kingdom. The shares were acquired through a series of open market purchases and acceptances of the tender offer at a price of\n165\npence per share. As a result of additional acceptances of the offer and the exercise of the right to acquire compulsorily the Vectura shares, in accordance with the applicable English law, PMI completed the acquisition of\n100\n% of Vectura in the fourth quarter of 2021. The acquisition was funded with existing cash from a designated account operated solely for the purpose of funding this acquisition.\nThe total purchase price of $\n1,384\nmillion (GBP\n1.0\nbillion) for\n100\n% of the Vectura shares was allocated to cash ($\n136\nmillion), current assets including receivables and inventories ($\n89\nmillion), non-current assets including property, plant and equipment ($\n67\nmillion), goodwill ($\n780\nmillion), and other intangible assets ($\n486\nmillion, which primarily consisted of developed technology, and IPR&D), partially offset by current liabilities ($\n100\nmillion, primarily accrued liabilities), and non-current liabilities ($\n74\nmillion, primarily deferred income tax).  Goodwill is primarily attributable to future growth opportunities provided by acquired R&D capabilities and any intangibles that did not qualify for separate recognition.  The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.  The amortizable intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of\n3\nto\n13\nyears. During 2022, PMI made certain measurement period adjustments to the purchase price allocation to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date, which resulted in an increase to goodwill of $\n190\nmillion.  The increase was primarily due to a decrease in other intangible assets ($\n233\nmillion), and a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities ($\n43\nmillion).  The final purchase price allocation was reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\nPro forma results of operations for AG Snus, Fertin Pharma and Vectura have not been presented as the aggregate impact is not material to PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\nAltria Group, Inc. Agreement\nOn October 20, 2022, PMI announced that it had reached an agreement with Altria Group, Inc. to end the companies' relationship regarding the\nIQOS\ncommercialization rights in the U.S. as of April 30, 2024.  As a result of PMI reacquiring these rights, effective May 1, 2024, PMI will have the full rights to commercialize\nIQOS\nin the U.S.  As part of the agreement, PMI agreed to pay a total cash consideration of $\n2.7\nbillion, with $\n1.0\nbillion paid at the inception of the agreement and the remaining $\n1.7\nbillion (plus interest, at a per annum rate equal to six percent (\n6\n%)), to be paid by July 2023 at the latest.  The cash consideration paid at the inception of the agreement of $\n1.0\nbillion has been accounted for within other assets in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.  As of May 2024, when PMI can exercise its ability to commercialize\nIQOS\nin the U.S., PMI will finalize the accounting for this transaction by assigning the consideration to the respective assets.\n84\nAsset Acquisition\nOn August 9, 2021, PMI acquired\n100\n% of OtiTopic, Inc., a U.S. respiratory drug development company with a late-stage dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment for acute myocardial infarction. The transaction price was $\n38\nmillion in cash, plus transaction costs, with additional contingent payment of $\n13\nmillion, primarily related to certain key milestones that PMI deemed probable.  Additionally, PMI may owe up to $\n25\nmillion in future additional contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain milestones. PMI accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition since the IPR&D of the dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired. At the date of acquisition, PMI determined that the acquired IPR&D had no alternative future use. As a result, PMI recorded a charge of $\n51\nmillion to research and development costs within\nmarketing, administration and research costs\nin the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs previously discussed in Note 1.\nBackground and Basis of Presentation\non March 31, 2022, PMI launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma, which consolidates Fertin Pharma, Vectura and OtiTopic, Inc. into one operating segment.\nWar in Ukraine:\nSince the onset of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, PMI's main priority has been the safety and security of its more than\n1,300\nemployees and their families in the country.\nUkraine\nPMI temporarily suspended its commercial and manufacturing operations in Ukraine, including the closing of its factory in Kharkiv at the end of February 2022, in order to preserve the safety of its employees.  PMI subsequently resumed some retail activities where safety allowed, in order to provide product availability and service to adult consumers, and began to supply the market from production centers outside Ukraine, as well as through a contract manufacturing arrangement.  Production at the factory in Kharkiv remains suspended.  While the effects of the war are unpredictable and could trigger impairment reviews for long-lived assets, as of December 31, 2022, PMI is unable to estimate the information required to perform impairment analyses (i.e., forecast of revenues, manufacturing and commercial plans).  PMI is not aware of any major damage to its production facilities, inventories or other assets in Ukraine.  As a result, PMI has not recorded an impairment of long-lived assets. As of December 31, 2022, PMI’s Ukrainian operations had approximately $\n414\nmillion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances.  These total assets included $\n69\nmillion, $\n279\nmillion and $\n31\nmillion in receivables, inventories and property, plant and equipment, respectively.\nRussia\nPMI has suspended its planned investments in the Russian Federation including all new product launches and commercial, innovation, and manufacturing investments.  PMI has also taken steps to scale down its manufacturing operations in Russia amid ongoing supply chain disruptions and the evolving regulatory environment.  PMI is continuously assessing the evolving situation in Russia, including: recent regulatory constraints in the market that entail very complex terms and conditions that must be met for any divestment transaction to be granted approval by the authorities; and restrictions resulting from international regulations. As a result of PMI continuing operations within Russia as of December 31, 2022, it has not recorded an impairment of long-lived and other assets.  However, PMI recorded specific asset write downs as referred to in the table below.  PMI’s Russian operations as of December 31, 2022 had approximately $\n2.5\nbillion in total assets, excluding intercompany balances.  These total assets included $\n578\nmillion, $\n541\nmillion, $\n786\nmillion, $\n334\nmillion and $\n161\nmillion in cash (primarily held in local currency), receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment and goodwill, respectively.  In addition, there was approximately $\n806\nmillion of cumulative foreign currency translation losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive losses in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022.\n85\nAs of December 31, 2022, PMI recorded in its consolidated statements of earnings pre-tax charges related to circumstances driven by the war as follows:\n1\nThe charges were primarily due to an inventory write down, additional allowance for receivables and the cost of PMI’s humanitarian efforts, which includes salary continuation for its employees.\n2\nThe charges were primarily due to machinery and inventory write downs related to the commercial decisions noted above.\nPMI will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves and will determine if further charges are needed.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net:\nThe movements in goodwill were as follows:\nThe increase in goodwill in 2022 was due primarily to the final purchase price allocation associated with Vectura Group plc acquisition in 2021 (reflected in \"changes due to other\" in Wellness and Healthcare segment) and the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the Swedish Match AB acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by currency movements.  For further details on these business combinations, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.\nAt December 31, 2022, goodwill primarily reflects PMI’s business combinations in Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines and Serbia, as well as the final purchase price allocation of Fertin Pharma A/S and Vectura Group plc., which were acquired in September 2021, and the preliminary purchase price allocation of Swedish Match AB, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs discussed in Note 1.\nBackground and Basis of Presentation\n, during the first quarter of 2022, one of Fertin Pharma's product lines was moved from the Wellness and Healthcare segment to the European Union segment.  As a result, the December 31, 2021 goodwill balance in the table above included a reclassification of $\n24\nmillion from the Wellness and Healthcare segment to the European Union segment (reflected in changes due to acquisitions in 2021).\n86\nDetails of other intangible assets were as follows:\nNon-amortizable intangible assets substantially consist of trademarks from PMI’s acquisitions in Indonesia and Mexico, as well as the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the Swedish Match acquisition in 2022, and PMI's business combinations in 2021 (primarily in-process research and development).  The increase since December 31, 2021 was due to the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the Swedish Match acquisition in 2022 of $\n2,077\nmillion, partially offset by the final purchase price allocation associated with Vectura Group plc acquisition in 2021 in the amount of $(\n3\n) million and currency movements of $(\n40\n) million.\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets from December 31, 2021, was due to the preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the Swedish Match acquisition in 2022 of $\n2,435\nmillion, partially offset by final purchase price allocation associated with PMI's business combinations in 2021 and other movements in the amount of $(\n225\n) million, and currency movements of $(\n93\n) million.  For further details on these business combinations, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.\nThe change in the accumulated amortization from December 31, 2021, was mainly due to the 2022 amortization of $\n159\nmillion and impairment charge of\n$\n112\nmillion, partially offset by currency movements of $\n34\nmillion.  The amortization of intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2022 was recorded in cost of sales ($\n58\nmillion) and in marketing, administration and research costs ($\n101\nmillion) on PMI's consolidated statements of earnings.\nAmortization expense for each of the next five years is estimated to be $\n310\nmillion or less, assuming no additional transactions occur that require the amortization of intangible assets.  This estimate is subject to change based on the finalization of the preliminary purchase price allocation of the Swedish Match acquisition.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, and\nno\nimpairment charges were required as a result of this review.  However, there are still risks related to PMI’s Russian reporting unit’s assets as the fair value of these assets is difficult to predict due to the volatility in foreign currency and commodity markets, supply chain, and current economic, political and social conditions.  For more information see Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\n.  Each of PMI’s reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of its carrying value with the exception of the Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit, which had less than\n20\n% excess of fair value over its carrying value in the period of the latest review of goodwill for potential impairment.  The Wellness and Healthcare reporting unit's fair value was determined using the discounted cash flow model.  PMI will continue to monitor this reporting unit as any changes in assumptions, estimates or market factors could result in a future impairment.\nPMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n112\nmillion in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting the impact of general economic and market conditions resulting in a reduction in future estimated cash flows on certain products within the Wellness and Healthcare segment.  The impairment reduces the carrying values of developed technology definite-lived intangible assets in the Wellness and Healthcare segment to $\n325\nmillion. The fair value of these intangible assets was primarily determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. This impairment charge was recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n87\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other:\nEquity Method Investments:\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, PMI had total equity method investments of $\n1,000\nmillion and $\n879\nmillion, respectively.  Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost.  Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is adjusted for PMI's proportionate share of earnings or losses, dividends, capital contributions, changes in ownership interests and movements in currency translation adjustments.  The carrying value of our equity method investments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, exceeded our share of the investees' book value by $\n750\nmillion and $\n764\nmillion, respectively.  The difference between the investment carrying value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets, excluding $\n715\nmillion and $\n728\nmillion attributable to goodwill as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which consists primarily of definite-lived intangible assets is being amortized on a straight-line basis. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, PMI received year-to-date dividends from equity method investees of $\n9\nmillion and $\n176\nmillion, respectively.\nPMI holds a\n23\n% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution BV, the holding company of CJSC TK Megapolis, PMI's distributor in Russia (Eastern Europe segment), which as of December 31, 2022 had a carrying value of $\n458\nmillion.  While as of December 31, 2022, there have been no impairment indicators based on the business’ performance, there are still risks related to this investment as the fair value of these assets is difficult to predict due to the volatility in foreign currency and commodity markets, supply chain, and current economic, political and social conditions.  For more information, see Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\n.   Additionally, there was approximately $\n469\nmillion of cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with Megapolis Distribution BV reflected in accumulated other comprehensive losses in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2022.\nPMI holds a\n49\n% equity interest in United Arab Emirates-based Emirati Investors-TA (FZC) (“EITA”).  PMI holds an approximate\n25\n% economic interest in Société des Tabacs Algéro-Emiratie (“STAEM”), an Algerian joint venture that is\n51\n% owned by EITA and\n49\n% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et Développement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI’s brands (Middle East & Africa segment).\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV and EITA were recorded at cost and are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\nEquity securities:\nFollowing the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI recorded the continuing investment in RBH, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, at fair value of $\n3,280\nmillion at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.  Transactions between PMI and RBH are considered to be related-party transactions from the date of deconsolidation and are included in the tables below.\nThe fair value of PMI’s other equity securities, which have been classified within Level 1, was $\n326\nmillion and $\n283\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Unrealized pre-tax gains (losses) of $\n43\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion ($\n33\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion net of tax) on these equity securities were recorded in equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net on the consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values, see Note 2\n.

GPI also acts as contract manufacturer and distributor for IPM India.\n88\nFinancial activity with the above related parties:\nPMI’s net revenues and expenses with the above related parties were as follows:\n(a)\nNet revenues exclude excise taxes and VAT billed to customers.\nPMI’s balance sheet activity with the above related parties was as follows:\nThe activities with the above related parties are in the ordinary course of business, and are primarily for distribution, service fees, contract manufacturing and license agreements.  PMI eliminated its respective share of all significant intercompany transactions with the equity method investees.\nProduct Warranty:\nPMI's heat-not-burn devices and e-vapor products are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of\n12\nmonths from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law.  PMI generally provides in cost of sales for the estimated cost of warranty in the period the related revenue is recognized.  PMI assesses the adequacy of its accrued product warranties and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.  Factors that affect product warranties may vary across markets but typically include device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies.  PMI accounts for its product warranties within other accrued liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, these amounts were as follows:\n89\nIndebtedness:\nShort-Term Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, PMI’s short-term borrowings and related average interest rates consisted of the following:\nGiven the mix of subsidiaries and their respective local economic environments, the average interest rate for bank loans above can vary significantly from day to day and country to country.\nThe fair values of PMI’s short-term borrowings at December 31, 2022 and 2021, based upon current market interest rates, approximate the amounts disclosed above.\nLong-Term Debt\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, PMI’s long-term debt consisted of the following:\n(a)\nIncludes mortgage debt in Switzerland as well as $\n54\nmillion and $\n71\nmillion in finance leases at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe fair value of PMI’s outstanding long-term debt, which is utilized solely for disclosure purposes, is determined using quotes and market interest rates currently available to PMI for issuances of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021 the fair value of PMI's outstanding long-term debt, excluding the aforementioned finance leases, was as follows:\n90\nFor a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values, see Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nFinancing of the Swedish Match Acquisition\nIn connection with PMI’s all-cash recommended public offer to the shareholders of Swedish Match AB (\"Swedish Match\"), a public limited liability company organized under the laws of Sweden, for all the outstanding shares of Swedish Match, on May 11, 2022, PMI entered into a credit agreement relating to a\n364\n-day senior unsecured bridge facility.  The facility provided for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of $\n17\nbillion, expiring\n364\ndays after the occurrence of certain events unless extended. On June 23, 2022, PMI entered into a new €\n5.5\nbillion (approximately $\n5.8\nbillion at the date of signing) senior unsecured term loan credit agreement consisting of a €\n3.0\nbillion (approximately $\n3.2\nbillion at the date of signing) tranche expiring\nthree years\nafter the occurrence of certain events and a €\n2.5\nbillion (approximately $\n2.6\nbillion at the date of signing) tranche expiring on June 23, 2027. In connection with the term loan facility, the aggregate principal amount of commitments under the\n364\n-day senior unsecured bridge facility was reduced from $\n17\nbillion to $\n11\nbillion.  On November 11, 2022, PMI acquired a controlling interest of\n85.87\n% of the total issued shares in Swedish Match and has acquired\n94.81\n% of its outstanding shares as of December 31, 2022.\nPMI borrowed $\n8.4\nbillion under the bridge facility by delivering notices of borrowing for advances of $\n7.9\nbillion and $\n0.5\nbillion on November 7, 2022 and November 10, 2022, respectively. All amounts borrowed under the bridge facility will become due on November 8, 2023 unless prepaid or such maturity date is extended pursuant to the terms of the bridge facility.  On November 7, 2022, PMI also delivered notices of borrowing for advances totaling €\n5.5\nbillion under the term loan facility, of which €\n3.0\nbillion will become due on November 9, 2025 and €\n2.5\nbillion will become due on June 23, 2027 unless prepaid pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. On November 21, 2022, PMI repaid $\n4.0\nbillion under the bridge facility. As of December 31, 2022, outstanding borrowings under the bridge facility amounted to $\n4.4\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion commitments remained available for drawing. As of December 31, 2022, the €\n5.5\nbillion (approximately $\n5.9\nbillion) term loan facility was fully drawn and remained outstanding. The proceeds under the bridge facility and the term loan facility were used, directly or indirectly, to finance the acquisition, including, the payment of related fees and expenses. For further details on this acquisition, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.\nNotes Outstanding:\nPMI’s notes outstanding at December 31, 2022, were as follows:\n91\n(a)\nNotes issued by Swedish Match AB. USD equivalents for foreign currency notes were calculated based on exchange rates on the date of acquisition.\n(b)\nThese notes are a further issuance of the\n4.250\n% notes issued by PMI in November 2014.\n(c)\nUSD equivalents for foreign currency notes were calculated based on exchange rates on the date of issuance.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above were primarily used for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements and repurchase of PMI's common stock.\n92\nAggregate maturities:\nAggregate maturities of long-term debt are as follows:\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nAt December 31, 2022, PMI’s total committed revolving credit facilities were as follows:\n(1)\nOn January 25, 2023, PMI entered into an agreement to amend and extend the term of its $\n1.8\nbillion\n364\n-day committed revolving credit facility from January 31, 2023, to January 30, 2024.\n(2)\nOn January 28, 2022, PMI entered into an agreement, effective February 10, 2022, to amend and extend the term of its $\n2.0\nbillion multi-year\nrevolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period February 11, 2026 to February 10, 2027, in the amount of $\n1.9\nbillion.\n(3)\nIncludes pricing adjustments that may result in the reduction or increase in both the interest rate and commitment fee under the credit agreement if PMI achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets.\n(4)\nOn September 20, 2022, PMI entered into an agreement, effective September 29, 2022, to amend and extend the term of its $\n2.5\nbillion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period September 30, 2026 to September 29, 2027, in the amount of $\n2.3\nbillion.\nAt December 31, 2022, there were\nno\nborrowings under these committed revolving credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing.\nThese committed revolving credit facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require PMI to post collateral.\nIn addition to the committed revolving credit facilities discussed above, certain subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs.  These credit arrangements, which amounted to approximately $\n1.9\nbillion at December 31, 2022, and approximately $\n2.3\nbillion at December 31, 2021, are for the sole use of the subsidiaries.  Borrowings under these arrangements and other bank loans amounted to $\n295\nmillion at December 31, 2022, and $\n225\nmillion at December 31, 2021.\n93\nCapital Stock:\nShares of authorized common stock are\n6.0\nbillion; issued, repurchased and outstanding shares were as follows:\nOn June 11, 2021, PMI's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $\n7\nbillion, with target spending of $\n5\nbillion to $\n7\nbillion over a\nthree-year\nperiod.  On July 22, 2021, PMI began repurchasing shares under this new share repurchase program.  From July 22, 2021 through March 31, 2022, PMI repurchased\n10.5\nmillion shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $\n1.0\nbillion.  During the first three months of 2022, PMI repurchased\n2.0\nmillion shares of its common stock at a cost of $\n199\nmillion.  On May 11, 2022, PMI announced the suspension of its\nthree-year\nshare repurchase program following the recommended public offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Swedish Match from its shareholders.  For further details, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.  Prior to the suspension of the program, PMI made no share repurchases during the second quarter of 2022.\nAt December 31, 2022,\n33,284,616\nshares of common stock were reserved for stock awards under PMI’s stock plans, and\n250\nmillion shares of preferred stock, without par value, were authorized but unissued.  PMI currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nStock Plans:\nIn May 2022, PMI’s shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2022 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”).  The 2022 Plan replaced the 2017 Performance Incentive Plan, and there will be no additional grants under the replaced plan.  Under the 2022 Plan, PMI may grant to eligible employees restricted shares and restricted share units, performance-based cash incentive awards and performance-based equity awards.  Up to\n25\nmillion shares of PMI’s common stock may be issued under the 2022 Plan.  At December 31, 2022, shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan were\n24,856,420\n.\nIn May 2017, PMI’s shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2017 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan”).  A non-employee director is defined as a member of the PMI Board of Directors who is not a full-time employee of PMI or of any corporation in which PMI owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing at least\n50\n% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors in such corporation.  Up to\n1\nmillion shares of PMI common stock may be awarded under the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan.  At December 31, 2022, shares available for grant under the plan were\n894,346\n.\n94\nRestricted share unit (RSU) awards\nPMI may grant RSU awards to eligible employees; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards.  Such awards are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.  RSU awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.  RSU awards do not carry voting rights, although they do earn dividend equivalents.\nDuring 2022, the activity for RSU awards was as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the grant date fair value of the RSU awards granted to PMI employees and the recorded compensation expense related to RSU awards were as follows:\nThe fair value of the RSU awards at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the restriction period, typically\nthree years\nafter the date of the award, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.  As of December 31, 2022, PMI had $\n158\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSU awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of  approximately\nseventeen months\n, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, share and fair value information for PMI RSU awards that vested were as follows:\n95\nPerformance share unit (PSU) awards\nPMI may grant PSU awards to certain executives; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards.  The PSU awards require the achievement of certain performance metrics, which are predetermined at the time of grant, typically over a\nthree-year\nperformance cycle.  The performance metrics for such PSU's granted during 2022 consisted of PMI's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") relative to a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (\n40\n% weight), PMI’s currency-neutral compound annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate (\n30\n% weight), and a Sustainability Index, which consists of two drivers:\n•\nPro\nduct Sustainability\n(\n20\n% weight) measuring progress on PMI's efforts to maximize the benefits of smoke-free products, purposefully phase out cigarettes, seek net positive impact in wellness and healthcare, and reduce post-consumer waste; and\n•\nOperational Sustainability\n(\n10\n% weight) measuring progress on PMI's efforts to tackle climate change, preserve nature, improve the quality of life of people in its supply chain, and foster an empowered, and inclusive workplace.\nThe performance metrics for such PSU's granted during 2021 and 2020 consisted of PMI's TSR relative to a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (\n40\n% weight), PMI’s currency-neutral compound annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate (\n30\n% weight), and PMI’s performance against specific measures of PMI’s transformation, defined as net revenues from PMI's RRPs and any other non-combustible products as a percentage of PMI's total net revenues in the last year of the performance cycle (\n30\n% weight).\nThe aggregate of the weighted performance factors for the\nthree\nmetrics in each such PSU award determines the percentage of PSUs that will vest at the end of the\nthree-year\nperformance cycle.  The minimum percentage of such PSUs that can vest is\nzero\n, with a target percentage of\n100\nand a maximum percentage of\n200\n.  Each such vested PSU entitles the participant to\none\nshare of common stock.  An aggregate weighted PSU performance factor of\n100\nwill result in the targeted number of PSUs being vested.  At the end of the performance cycle, participants are entitled to an amount equivalent to the accumulated dividends paid on common stock during the performance cycle for the number of shares earned.  PSU awards do not carry voting rights.\nDuring 2022, the activity for PSU awards was as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the grant date fair value of the PSU awards granted to PMI employees and the recorded compensation expense related to PSU awards were as follows:\n96\nThe grant date fair value of the PSU awards subject to the other performance factors was determined by using the market price of PMI’s stock on the date of the grant.  The grant date fair value of the PSU market-based awards subject to the TSR performance factor was determined by using the Monte Carlo simulation model.\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value of the PSU awards subject to the TSR performance factor for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n(a)\nBased on the U.S. Treasury yield curve.\n(b)\nDetermined using the observed historical volatility.\nThe fair value of the PSU award at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the performance period, which is typically\nthree years\nafter the date of the award, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.   As of December 31, 2022, PMI had $\n42\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSU awards.  This cost is recognized over a weighted-average performance cycle period of approximately\nseventeen months\n, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, share and fair value information for PMI PSU awards that vested were as follows:\nEarnings per Share:\nUnvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and therefore are included in PMI’s earnings per share calculation pursuant to the two-class method.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were calculated using the following:\nFor the 2022, 2021 and 2020 computations, there were\nno\nantidilutive stock awards.\n97\nIncome Taxes:\nEarnings before income taxes and provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (\"the Act\") was signed into law in the U.S.  The Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax and an excise tax on stock buybacks effective after December 31, 2022.  As of December 31, 2022, PMI has determined that the Act had no significant tax impacts on its consolidated financial statements.\nOn March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\"the ARP Act\") was signed into law in the U.S. to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  PMI has determined that the ARP Act had no significant impact on PMI's effective tax rate.\nOn July 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final and proposed regulations under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. PMI has analyzed these elective regulations and recorded the impact in its consolidated financial statements, as described below.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and, on December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“U.S. COVID-19 Acts”) were signed into law in the U.S. to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, governments around the world have enacted or implemented various forms of tax relief measures in response to the economic conditions in the wake of COVID-19.  PMI has determined that neither the U.S. COVID-19 Acts nor changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions had a significant impact on PMI’s effective tax rate, with the exception of the 2020 corporate income tax rate reduction in Indonesia.\nAt December 31, 2017, PMI recorded a one-time transition tax liability on its accumulated foreign earnings, which is payable over an eight-year period beginning in 2018.  At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $\n0.7\nbillion and $\n0.9\nbillion of PMI's remaining long-term portion of transition tax liability, respectively, was recorded in \"income taxes and other liabilities\" on PMI's consolidated balance sheets.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, U.S. federal and foreign deferred income taxes have been provided on all accumulated earnings of PMI's foreign subsidiaries.\nPMI is regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and is currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions.  The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the years 2019 and onward.  Foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from\nthree\nto\nfive years\n.  Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Germany (2018 onward), Indonesia (2014 onward), Russia (2022 onward) and Switzerland (2017 onward).\nIn October 2021, a subsidiary of PMI in Indonesia, PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk (\"HMS\"), received a tax assessment in the amount of\n3.8\ntrillion Indonesian rupiah (approximately $\n260\nmillion in the period of payment) primarily relating to corporate income taxes on domestic and other intercompany transactions for the years 2017 to 2019.  HMS paid the assessment in the fourth quarter of 2021 in order to avoid potential penalties and filed an objection letter with the tax office in January 2022.  The amount paid was\n98\nincluded in other assets in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment.\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties.  An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\nUnrecognized tax benefits and PMI’s liability for contingent income taxes, interest and penalties were as follows:\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $\n69\nmillion at December 31, 2022. The remainder, if recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, PMI recognized income (expense) in its consolidated statements of earnings of $\n2\nmillion, $(\n3\n) million and $(\n1\n) million, respectively, related to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.\nThe effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nThe 2022 effective tax rate decreased\n2.5\npercentage point to\n19.3\n%.  The change in the effective tax rate for 2022, as compared to 2021, was favorably impacted by changes in income tax reserves, a deferred tax benefit for unrealized foreign currency losses on intercompany loans related to the Swedish Match acquisition financing reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings ($\n203\nmillion), while the underlying pre-tax foreign currency movements fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in its consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity, and by a reduction in\n99\ndeferred tax liabilities related to pension plan assets ($\n40\nmillion), partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the fair value adjustment of equity securities held by PMI ($\n10\nmillion).   For further details, see Note 6.\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\n.\nThe 2021 effective tax rate increased\n0.1\npercentage point to\n21.8\n%.  The change in the effective tax rate for 2021, as compared to 2020, was unfavorably impacted by repatriation cost differences and foreign tax credit limitations related to GILTI, partially offset by the corporate income tax rate reduction in the Philippines (enacted in the first quarter of 2021) and changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.\nThe 2020 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the above-mentioned reduction of estimated U.S. income tax liabilities for years 2018 and 2019 due to the GILTI regulations and the corporate income tax rate reduction in Indonesia.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:\n(1)\nIncludes deferred tax charges of $\n153\nmillion in 2021 related to intercompany transactions.\nAt December 31, 2022, PMI recorded deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits of $\n384\nmillion, with varying dates of expiration, primarily after 2027, including $\n173\nmillion with an unlimited carryforward period.  At December 31, 2022, PMI has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n378\nmillion against deferred tax assets that do not meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold.\nAt December 31, 2021, PMI recorded deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards of $\n408\nmillion, with varying dates of expiration, primarily after 2026, including $\n183\nmillion with an unlimited carryforward period.  At December 31, 2021, PMI has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n239\nmillion against deferred tax assets that do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.\nSegment Reporting:\nPMI’s subsidiaries and affiliates are primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor, and oral nicotine products.  Excluding the Wellness and Healthcare segment and the 2022 acquisition of Swedish Match, PMI's segments are generally organized by geographic region and managed by segment managers who are responsible for the\n100\noperating and financial results of the regions inclusive of combustible tobacco and smoke-free product categories sold in the region.  PMI currently has\nsix\ngeographical segments: the European Union; Eastern Europe; Middle East & Africa; South & Southeast Asia; East Asia & Australia; and Americas; as well as the Swedish Match segment and the Wellness and Healthcare segment.  The Swedish Match segment represents the fourth quarter 2022 acquisition of the company.  The Wellness and Healthcare segment reflects the operating results of PMI's new business, Vectura Fertin Pharma.  For further details on these acquisitions, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions\n.  PMI records net revenues and operating income to its geographical segments based upon the geographic area in which the customer resides.\nPMI’s chief operating decision maker evaluates geographical segment performance and allocates resources based on regional operating income, which includes results from substantially all product categories sold in each region.  Business operations in the Wellness and Healthcare segment and the Swedish Match segment are managed and evaluated separately.  Interest expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management.  Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by PMI’s chief operating decision maker.  Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in Note 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nPMI disaggregates its net revenues from contracts with customers by product category for each of PMI's\nsix\ngeographical segments and for the Swedish Match segment.  For the Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma discussed above, net revenues from contracts with customers are included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment.  PMI believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nNet revenues by segment were as follows:\nTotal net revenues attributable to customers located in Japan, PMI's largest market in terms of net revenues, were $\n3.9\nbillion, $\n4.6\nbillion and $\n4.1\nbillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  PMI had one customer in the East Asia & Australia segment that accounted for\n12\n%,\n15\n% and\n14\n% of PMI’s consolidated net revenues, and one customer in the European Union segment that accounted for\n13\n%,\n13\n% and\n11\n% of PMI’s consolidated net revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n101\nPMI's net revenues by product category were as follows:\nNote: Sum of product categories or Regions might not foot to total PMI due to roundings.\nFollowing the Swedish Match acquisition and a review of PMI and Swedish Match’s combined product portfolio, PMI reclassified certain of its own products previously reported under its combustible tobacco product category to the newly created smoke-free product category to better reflect the characteristics of these products. This reclassification did not impact PMI’s segment reporting, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.\nNet revenues related to combustible tobacco products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of PMI's cigarettes and other tobacco products that are combusted. Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include smoke-free products.\nNet revenues related to smoke-free products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes, if applicable. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of all of PMI's products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and oral nicotine, also including wellness and healthcare products, as well as consumer accessories such as lighters and matches.\nNet revenues related to wellness and healthcare products consist of operating revenues generated from the sale of products primarily associated with inhaled therapeutics, and oral and intra-oral delivery systems that are included in the operating results of PMI's new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma.\n102\nOperating income (loss) by segment were as follows:\nItems affecting the comparability of results from operations were as follows:\n•\nCharges related to the war in Ukraine\n-  See Note 4.\nWar in Ukraine\nfor details of the $\n151\nmillion pre-tax charges in the Eastern Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nSwedish Match AB acquisition accounting related item\n- See\nNote 3. Acquisitions\nfor details of the $\n125\nmillion pre-tax purchase accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventories stepped up to fair value included in the Swedish Match segment for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nImpairment of intangibles\n- See Note 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\nfor the details of the $\n112\nmillion pre-tax impairment charge included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment within the operating income table above for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nAsset impairment and exit costs\n- See Note 20.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nfor details of the $\n216\nmillion and $\n149\nmillion pre-tax charges for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as well as a breakdown of these costs by segment.\n•\nSaudi Arabia customs assessments\n- See Note 18.\nContingencies\nfor the details of the $\n246\nmillion reduction in net revenues of combustible tobacco products included in the Middle East & Africa segment for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n•\nAsset acquisition cost\n- See Note 3.\nAcquisitions\nfor the details of the $\n51\nmillion pre-tax charge associated with the asset acquisition of OtiTopic, Inc. included in the Wellness and Healthcare segment within the operating income table above for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n•\nBrazil indirect tax credit\n- Following a final and enforceable decision by the highest court in Brazil in October 2020, PMI recorded a gain of $\n119\nmillion for tax credits representing overpayments of indirect taxes for the period from March 2012 through December 2019; these tax credits were applied to tax liabilities in Brazil during 2021.  This amount was included as a reduction in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was included in the operating income of the Americas segment.  An additional amount of overpaid indirect taxes of approximately $\n90\nmillion is dependent on the outcome of a challenge by the local tax authority.\n103\nOther segment data were as follows:\nPMI’s total capital expenditures and total property, plant and equipment, net and other assets by geographic area were:\nLong-lived assets consist of non-current assets other than goodwill; other intangible assets, net; deferred tax assets, equity investments, financial instruments and payment under the agreement with Altria Group, Inc, see Note 3,\nAcquisitions\n.  PMI's largest markets in terms of long-lived assets are Switzerland, Italy and Indonesia.  Total long-lived assets located in Switzerland, which is reflected in the European Union segment above, were $\n1.4\nbillion, $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n1.3\nbillion at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Total long-lived assets located in Italy, which is reflected in the European Union segment above, were $\n0.9\nbillion, $\n0.9\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Total long-lived assets located in Indonesia, which is reflected in the South & Southeast Asia segment above, were $\n0.9\nbillion, $\n0.9\nbillion and $\n0.7\nbillion at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n104\nBenefit Plans:\nPension coverage for employees of PMI’s subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans, many of which are governed by local statutory requirements.  In addition, PMI provides health care and other benefits to certain U.S. retired employees and certain non-U.S. retired employees.  In general, health care benefits for non-U.S. retired employees are covered through local government plans.\nPension and other employee benefit costs per the consolidated statements of earnings consisted of the following for December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n105\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nObligations and Funded Status\nThe projected benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of PMI’s pension plans, and the accumulated benefit obligation, plan assets and net amount accrued for PMI's postretirement health care plans, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows:\n(1)  Primarily non-U.S. based defined benefit retirement plans.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, actuarial losses (gains) consisted primarily of gains for assumption changes related to higher discount rates year-over-year for Swiss, German and Dutch plans.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Swiss pension plan represented\n64\n% and\n65\n% of the benefit obligation, respectively, and approximately\n60\n% and\n60\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the U.S. pension plans represented\n7\n% and\n4\n% of the benefit obligation, respectively, and approximately\n6\n% and\n3\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amounts recognized on PMI's consolidated balance sheets for the pension and postretirement plans were as follows:\n106\nThe accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, for the pension plans was $\n8.2\nbillion and $\n10.4\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFor pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n5.8\nbillion and $\n5.0\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.  The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n7.5\nbillion and $\n5.9\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021.\nFor pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n6.4\nbillion and $\n5.4\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.  The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n8.6\nbillion and $\n6.7\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations at December 31:\nThe discount rate for the largest pension plans is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to each plan’s expected benefit payments.  The discount rate for the remaining plans is developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible.\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost\nNet periodic pension and postretirement health care costs consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nSettlement and curtailment charges were due primarily to employee severance and early retirement programs.\n107\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI’s net pension and postretirement health care costs:\nPMI’s expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.\nPMI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.  Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled $\n82\nmillion, $\n71\nmillion and $\n66\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPlan Assets\nPMI’s investment strategy for pension plans is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term.  Accordingly, the target allocation of PMI’s plan assets is broadly characterized as approximately\n55\n% in equity securities and approximately\n45\n% in debt securities and other assets. The strategy primarily utilizes indexed U.S. equity securities, international equity securities and investment-grade debt securities.  PMI attempts to mitigate investment risk by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes once a year or as PMI’s contributions and benefit payments are made.\n108\nThe fair value of PMI’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset category was as follows:\n(a)\nInvestment funds whose objective seeks to replicate the returns and characteristics of specified market indices (primarily MSCI — Europe, Switzerland, North America, Asia Pacific, Japan; Russell 3000; S&P 500 for equities, and Citigroup EMU, Citigroup Non-EGBI EuroBIG, SBI AAA-BBB and JP Morgan EMBI for bonds), primarily consist of mutual funds, common trust funds and commingled funds.  Of these funds,\n57\n% are invested in U.S. and international equities;\n15\n% are invested in U.S. and international government bonds;\n16\n% are invested in corporate bonds and\n12\n% are invested in real estate.\n(b)\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10, certain investments measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position.\n(c)\nAmount relates to annuity policies of which the fair value is calculated using an actuarial model.\n(a)\nInvestment funds whose objective seeks to replicate the returns and characteristics of specified market indices (primarily MSCI — Europe, Switzerland, North America, Asia Pacific, Japan; Russell 3000; S&P 500 for equities, and Citigroup EMU and JP Morgan EMBI for bonds), primarily consist of mutual funds, common trust funds and commingled funds. Of these funds,\n59\n% were invested in U.S. and international equities;\n15\n% were invested in U.S. and international government bonds;\n14\n% were invested in corporate bonds, and\n12\n% were invested in real estate.\n109\n(b)\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 820-10, certain investments measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position.\nFor a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values, see Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nPMI makes, and plans to make, contributions, to the extent that they are tax deductible and meet specific funding requirements of its funded pension plans.  Currently, PMI anticipates making contributions of approximately $\n121\nmillion in 2023 to its pension plans, based on current tax and benefit laws. However, this estimate is subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets, or changes in interest and currency rates.\nThe estimated future benefit payments from PMI pension plans at December 31, 2022, are as follows:\nPMI's expected future annual benefit payments for its postretirement health care plans are estimated to be not material through 2032.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans\nPMI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor postemployment benefit plans covering certain designated salaried and hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees.  Net postemployment costs were $\n184\nmillion, $\n228\nmillion and $\n208\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe amounts recognized in accrued postemployment costs net of plan assets on PMI's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $\n807\nmillion and $\n925\nmillion, respectively.\nThe accrued postemployment costs were determined using a weighted-average discount rate of\n5.6\n% and\n3.1\n% in 2022 and 2021, respectively; an assumed ultimate annual weighted-average turnover rate of\n2.9\n% and\n2.9\n% in 2022 and 2021, respectively; assumed compensation cost increases of\n2.8\n% in 2022 and\n2.1\n% in 2021, and assumed benefits as defined in the respective plans.  In accordance with local regulations, certain postemployment plans are funded.  As a result, the accrued postemployment costs disclosed above are presented net of the related assets of $\n30\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Postemployment costs arising from actions that offer employees benefits in excess of those specified in the respective plans are charged to expense when incurred.\nComprehensive Earnings (Losses)\nThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses at December 31, 2022, consisted of the following:\n110\nThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses at December 31, 2021, consisted of the following:\nThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses at December 31, 2020, consisted of the following:\nThe movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2022, were as follows:\n111\nThe movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2021, were as follows:\nThe movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2020, were as follows:\n112\nAdditional Information:\nFinancial Instruments:\nOverview\nPMI operates in markets primarily outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world.  PMI utilizes certain financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures.  Derivative financial instruments are used by PMI principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures.  PMI is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Substantially all of PMI's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements, whereby the right to offset occurs in the event of default by a participating party. While these contracts contain the enforceable right to offset through close-out netting rights, PMI elects to present them on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets. Collateral associated with these arrangements is in the form of cash and is unrestricted. Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period.  PMI formally documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur.  If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings.\nPMI uses deliverable and non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options, collectively referred to as foreign exchange contracts (\"foreign exchange contracts\"), and interest rate contracts to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange and interest rates related to net investments in foreign operations, third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions.  Both foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts are collectively referred to as derivative contracts (\"derivative contracts\").  The primary currencies to which PMI is exposed include the Euro, Egyptian pound, Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Russian ruble and Swiss franc.\n113\nThe gross notional amounts for outstanding derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows:\nThe fair value of PMI’s derivative contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows:\nPMI assesses the fair value of its foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts using standard valuation models that use, as their basis, readily observable market inputs.  The fair value of PMI’s foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency swaps and interest rate contracts is determined by using the prevailing foreign exchange spot rates and interest rate differentials, and the respective maturity dates of the instruments.  The fair value of PMI’s currency options is determined by using a Black-Scholes methodology based on foreign exchange spot rates and interest rate differentials, currency volatilities and maturity dates.  PMI’s derivative contracts have been classified within Level 2 at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n114\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, PMI's derivative contracts impacted the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings as follows:\n(a)\nThe gains (losses) from these contracts are offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item\n(b)\nAmount of gains (losses) on hedges of net investments principally related to changes in exchange and interest rates between the Euro and U.S. dollar\n(c)\nRepresent the gains for amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing\n(d)\nThe gains (losses) from these contracts attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the (losses) and gains generated by the underlying intercompany and third-party loans being hedged\nCash Flow Hedges\nPMI has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks related to certain forecasted transactions.  Gains and losses associated with qualifying cash flow hedge contracts are deferred as components of accumulated other comprehensive losses until the underlying hedged transactions are reported in PMI’s consolidated statements of earnings.  As of December 31, 2022, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions with derivative contracts expiring at various dates through May 2028. The impact of these hedges is primarily included in operating cash flows on PMI’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFair Value Hedges\nPMI has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts, designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated debt that results from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates.  For derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current earnings. The carrying amount of the debt hedged, which includes the cumulative adjustment for fair value gains/losses, as of December 31, 2022 was $\n913\nmillion, and is recorded in long-\n115\nterm debt in the consolidated balance sheets.  The cumulative amount of fair value gains/(losses) included in the carrying amount of the debt hedged was $\n83\nmillion as of December 31, 2022.\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\nPMI designates derivative contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges, primarily of its Euro net assets.  The amount of pre-tax gain/(loss) related to these debt instruments, that was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses within currency translation adjustments, was $\n521\nmillion\n, $\n278\nmillion and $(\n465\n) million, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The premiums paid for, and settlements of, net investment hedges are included in investing cash flows on PMI’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOther Derivatives\nPMI has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks related to intercompany loans between certain subsidiaries, third-party loans and acquisition related transactions.  While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts; therefore, the gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI’s consolidated statements of earnings.  Acquisition related transactions are included in investing cash flows on PMI’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nQualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\nDerivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity.  Transfers of these gains or losses to earnings are offset by the corresponding gains or losses on the underlying hedged item.\nHedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income taxes, as follows:\nAt December 31, 2022, PMI expects $\n81\nmillion of derivative gains that are included in accumulated other comprehensive losses to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings within the next 12 months. These gains are expected to be substantially offset by the statement of earnings impact of the respective hedged transactions.\nContingent Features\nPMI’s derivative instruments do not contain contingent features.\nCredit Exposure and Credit Risk\nPMI is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.  While PMI does not anticipate non-performance, its risk is limited to the fair value of the financial instruments less any cash collateral received or pledged.  PMI actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting and continuously monitoring a diverse group of major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties.\n116\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Losses:\nPMI's accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of taxes, consisted of the following:\nReclassifications from Other Comprehensive Earnings\nThe movements in accumulated other comprehensive losses and the related tax impact, for each of the components above, that are due to current period activity and reclassifications to the income statement are shown on the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. For additional information, see Note 3.\nAcquisitions (Transactions With Noncontrolling Interests)\nfor disclosures related to currency translation adjustments\n,\nNote 14.\nBenefit Plans\nfor disclosures related to PMI's pension and other benefits and Note 16.\nFinancial Instruments\nfor disclosures related to derivative financial instruments.\nContingencies:\nTobacco-Related Litigation\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a U.S. tobacco subsidiary of Altria, for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\nIt is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions of U.S. dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.\nWe and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 18.\nContingencies,\nwhile it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n117\nIt is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Tobacco-Related Cases Pending in Canada\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec’s decision in both the\nLétourneau\nand\nBlais\ncases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (“RBH”), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”) on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course.  The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers. RBH's financial results have been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements since March 22, 2019. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 31, 2023 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions.  These proceedings are presented below under the caption “\nStayed Litigation — Canada\n.” Ernst & Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings.  In accordance with the CCAA process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision in the\nLétourneau\nand the\nBlais\ncases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both\nLétourneau\nand the\nBlais\ncases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada.  It is not possible to predict the resolution of the underlying legal proceedings or the length of the CCAA process.\nStayed Litigation — Canada\nSmoking and Health Litigation — Canada\nIn the first class action pending in Canada,\nConseil Québécois Sur Le Tabac Et La Santé and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.,\nRothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada\n, filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who suffers allegedly from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and\ntwo\nother Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members’ compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD\n15.5\nbillion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $\n11.5\nbillion). The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating\n20\n% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD\n3.1\nbillion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $\n2.3\nbillion)). In addition, the trial court awarded CAD\n90,000\n(approximately $\n67,000\n) in punitive damages, allocating CAD\n30,000\n(approximately $\n22,000\n) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at\n99,957\nmembers.  RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD\n226\nmillion (approximately $\n168\nmillion) to cover both the\nLétourneau\nand\nBlais\ncases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017.  The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD\n758\nmillion (approximately $\n564\nmillion) in installments through June 2017.  JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs’ motion.  The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court’s judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal.\nOn March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the compensatory and punitive damages award while reducing the total amount of compensatory damages to approximately CAD\n13.5\nbillion including interest (approximately $\n10.1\nbillion) due to the trial court’s error in the calculation of interest. The compensatory damages award is on a joint and several basis with an allocation of\n20\n% to RBH (approximately CAD\n2.7\nbillion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $\n2.0\nbillion)). The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s findings that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking and by conspiring to prevent consumers from learning of the dangers of smoking. The Court of Appeal further held that the plaintiffs either need not prove, or had adequately proven, that these faults were a cause of the class members’ injuries.\n118\nIn accordance with the judgment, defendants were required to deposit their respective portions of the damages awarded in both the\nLétourneau\ncase described below and the\nBlais\ncase, approximately CAD\n1.1\nbillion (approximately $\n819\nmillion), into trust accounts within\n60\ndays.  RBH’s share of the deposit was approximately CAD\n257\nmillion (approximately $\n194\nmillion).  PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n194\nmillion in its consolidated results, representing $\n142\nmillion net of tax, as tobacco litigation-related expense, in the first quarter of 2019.  The charge reflects PMI’s assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment.\nIn the second class action pending in Canada,\nCecilia Létourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,\nfiled in September 1998, RBH and other Canadian cigarette manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants.  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and\ntwo\nother Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of CAD\n131\nmillion (approximately $\n98\nmillion) in punitive damages, allocating CAD\n46\nmillion (approximately $\n34.3\nmillion) to RBH. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at\n918,000\nmembers but declined to award compensatory damages to the addiction class because the evidence did not establish the claims with sufficient accuracy.  The trial court found that a claims process to allocate the awarded punitive damages to individual class members would be too expensive and difficult to administer.  On March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the total amount of punitive damages awarded allocating CAD\n57\nmillion including interest (approximately $\n42\nmillion) to RBH. See the\nBlais\ndescription above for further detail concerning the security order pertaining to both\nLétourneau\nand\nBlais\ncases and the impact of the decision on PMI’s financial statements.\nRBH and PMI believe the findings of liability and damages in both\nLétourneau\nand the\nBlais\ncases were incorrect and in contravention of applicable law on several grounds including the following: (i) defendants had no obligation to warn class members who knew, or should have known, of the risks of smoking; (ii) defendants cannot be liable to class members who would have smoked regardless of what warnings were given; and (iii) defendants cannot be liable to all class members given the individual differences between class members.\nIn the third class action pending in Canada,\nKunta v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., The Queen's Bench, Winnipeg, Canada\n, filed June 12, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants.

National Assembly of Venezuela and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court\n, filed April 29, 2008, we were not named as a defendant, but the plaintiffs published a notice pursuant to court order, notifying all interested parties to appear in the case. In January 2009, our subsidiary appeared in the case in response to this notice. The plaintiffs purport to represent the right to health of the citizens of Venezuela and claim that the government failed to protect adequately its citizens' right to health. The claim asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their “sales or benefits” to establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs have standing to file the claim and that the claim meets the threshold admissibility requirements. In December 2012, the court admitted our subsidiary and BAT's subsidiary as interested third parties. In February 2013, our subsidiary answered the complaint.\nReduced-Risk Products\nIn Colombia, an individual filed a purported class action,\nAna Ferrero Rebolledo v. Philip Morris Colombia S.A., et al.\n, in April 2019 against our subsidiaries with the Civil Court of Bogota related to the marketing of our Platform 1 product. Plaintiff alleged that our subsidiaries advertise the product in contravention of law and in a manner that misleads consumers by portraying the product in a positive light, and further asserts that the Platform 1 vapor contains many toxic compounds, creates a high level of dependence, and has damaging second-hand effects.   Plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages on her behalf and on behalf of two classes (class 1 - all Platform 1 consumers in Colombia who seek damages for the purchase price of the product and personal injuries related to the alleged addiction, and class 2 - all residents of the neighborhood where the advertising allegedly took place who seek damages for exposure to the alleged illegal advertising).  Our subsidiaries answered the complaint in January 2020, and in February 2020, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint modifies the relief sought on behalf of the named plaintiff and on behalf of a single class (all consumers of Platform 1 products in Colombia who seek damages for the product purchase price and personal injuries related to the use of an allegedly harmful product). In June 2021, our subsidiaries answered the amended complaint. The court has scheduled evidentiary hearings to take place in February 2023.\nOther Litigation\nThe Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (\"DSI\") conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by our subsidiary, Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\"), of customs duties and excise taxes relating to imports from the Philippines covering the period 2003-2007.  On January 18, 2016, the Public Prosecutor filed charges against our subsidiary and seven former and current employees\nin the\nBangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and the individual defendants jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government, under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the Philippines during the period of July 2003 to June 2006. The government sought a fine of approximately THB\n80.8\nbillion (approximately $\n2.4\nbillion).  In May 2017, Thailand enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings.  PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation\n126\nAgreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and other Thai governmental agencies.  Trial in the case began in November 2017 and concluded in September 2019.  In November 2019, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB\n1.2\nbillion (approximately $\n36\nmillion).  The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendants. In December 2019, as required by the Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine.  This payment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment.  Both our subsidiary and the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision.  The appellate court issued its decision on the appeals on June 1, 2022.  The appellate court affirmed the findings of under-declaration of import prices of cigarettes but reduced the fine to approximately THB\n122\nmillion (approximately $\n3.6\nmillion) finding the trial court erred in its calculation of the under-declaration and fine. The appellate court affirmed the acquittals of the individual defendants. Our subsidiary has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Thailand. The Public Prosecutor has also filed an appeal challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendants and the amount of the fine imposed. Thailand is required to refund any payment made by our subsidiary in excess of any fine asserted by the courts.\nThe DSI also conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by PM Thailand of customs duties and excise taxes relating to imports from Indonesia covering the period 2000-2003. On January 26, 2017, the Public Prosecutor filed charges against PM Thailand and its former Thai employee in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and its former employee jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries during the period from January 2002 to July 2003. The government is seeking a fine of approximately THB\n19.8\nbillion (approximately $\n588\nmillion). In May 2017, Thailand enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings.  PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law, and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and a Thai court. Trial in the case began in November 2018 and concluded in December 2019.  In March 2020, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB\n130\nmillion (approximately $\n3.9\nmillion).  The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendant. In April 2020, as required by Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. This payment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment. Our subsidiary filed an appeal of the trial court's decision.  In addition, the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine imposed. The appellate court issued its decision on the appeals on January 31, 2023.  The appellate court affirmed the findings of under-declaration of import prices of cigarettes but reduced the fine imposed by the trial court. The appellate court directed the Public Prosecutor to coordinate with customs officials to calculate such reduced fine in accordance with the appellate court’s decision, which will occur at a later date.  The appellate court affirmed the acquittal of the individual defendant. Both the Public Prosecutor and our subsidiary may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Thailand.  Thailand is required to refund any payment made by our subsidiary in excess of any fine assessed by the courts.\nThe South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection (“BAI”) conducted an audit of certain Korean government agencies and the tobacco industry into whether inventory movements ahead of the January 1, 2015 increase of cigarette-related taxes by tobacco companies, including Philip Morris Korea Inc. (\"PM Korea\"), our South Korean subsidiary, were in compliance with South Korean tax laws.  In November 2016, the tax authorities completed their audit and assessed allegedly underpaid taxes and penalties.  In order to avoid nonpayment financial costs, PM Korea paid approximately KRW\n272\nbillion (approximately $\n217\nmillion), of which KRW\n100\nbillion (approximately $\n80\nmillion) was paid in 2016 and KRW\n172\nbillion (approximately $\n137\nmillion) was paid in the first quarter of 2017.  These paid amounts are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment.  PM Korea appealed the assessments.  In January 2020, a trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay taxes in the amount of approximately KRW\n218\nbillion (approximately $\n173\nmillion).  The tax authorities appealed this decision to the appellate court. In September 2020, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The tax authorities have appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea. In June 2020, another trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay approximately KRW\n54\nbillion (approximately $\n43\nmillion) of alleged underpayments. The government agencies appealed this decision. In January 2021, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The government agencies appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea.  If the tax authorities and government agencies ultimately lose, then they would be required to return the paid amounts to PM Korea.\nThe Saudi Arabia Customs General Authority issued its assessments requiring our distributors to pay additional customs duties in the amount of approximately\n1.5\nbillion Saudi Riyal, or approximately $\n396\nmillion, in relation to the fees paid by these distributors under their agreements with our subsidiary for exclusive rights to distribute our products in Saudi Arabia.  In order to challenge these assessments, the distributors posted bank guarantees. To enable the distributors' challenge, our subsidiary agreed with the banks to bear a portion of the amount the authority may draw on the bank guarantees. In September and October 2020, respectively, the distributors lost their challenges of the assessments. Both distributors appealed, and in June 2021, the Customs Appeal Committee in Riyadh notified the distributors of its decisions to largely reject their appeals. On the basis of the above-mentioned decisions, in June 2021, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n246\nmillion in relation to the period of 2014 through 2020 in line with existing and\n127\ncontemplated arrangements with the distributors. The estimated amounts for 2021 and 2022 are immaterial. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the charge was recorded as a reduction in net revenues on the consolidated statements of earnings for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2021. Despite the unfavorable decisions, our subsidiary believes that customs duties paid in Saudi Arabia were in compliance with the applicable law and the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement.\nA putative shareholder class action lawsuit,\nIn re Philip Morris International Inc. Securities Litigation\n, is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on behalf of purchasers of Philip Morris International Inc. stock between July 26, 2016 and April 18, 2018.  The lawsuit names Philip Morris International Inc. and certain officers and employees as defendants and includes allegations that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information about PMI’s business, operations, financial condition, and prospects, related to product sales of, and alleged irregularities in clinical studies of, PMI’s Platform 1 product.   The lawsuit seeks various forms of relief, including damages.   In November 2018, the court consolidated three putative shareholder class action lawsuits with similar allegations previously filed in the Southern District of New York (namely,\nCity of Westland Police and Fire Retirement System v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al., Greater Pennsylvania Carpenters’ Pension Fund v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al., and Gilchrist v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al.\n) into these proceedings. A putative shareholder class action lawsuit,\nRubenstahl v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al.\n, that had been previously filed in December 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff due to similar allegations in these proceedings. On February 4, 2020, the court granted defendants’ motion in its entirety, dismissing all but one of the plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice.  The court noted that one of plaintiffs’ claims (allegations relating to four non-clinical studies of PMI’s Platform 1 product) did not state a viable claim but allowed plaintiffs to replead that claim by March 3, 2020.  On February 18, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's February 4th decision; this motion was denied on September 21, 2020. On September 28, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking to replead allegations relating to four non-clinical studies of PMI's Platform 1 product. On September 10, 2021, the court granted defendant's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' amended complaint in its entirety. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit. We believe that this lawsuit is without merit and will continue to defend it vigorously.\nIn April 2020, affiliates of British American Tobacco plc (“BAT”) commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Altria Client Services LLC, et al.\n, in the federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia, where PMI's subsidiary, Philip Morris Products S.A., as well as Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries, are defendants. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 blade products in the United States.  In April 2020, BAT affiliates filed a complaint against PMI, Philip Morris Products S.A., Altria Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries before the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\"). Plaintiffs seek an order to prevent the importation of Platform 1 products into the United States. The ITC evidentiary hearing closed on February 1, 2021. On May 14, 2021, the administrative law judge issued an Initial and Recommended Determination (\"ID/RD\") finding that the Platform 1 blade products infringe two of the three patents asserted by Plaintiffs, recommending that the ITC issue a Limited Exclusion order against infringing products, and recommending against a cease-and-desist, as well as recommending against a bond pending Presidential review of the ITC's Final Determination (\"FD\"). Defendants and Plaintiffs filed separate Petitions for Review with the ITC of the ID on May 28, 2021; on July 27, 2021, the ITC granted each of the petitions in part, deciding to review certain issues in the ID. Plaintiffs and Defendants also submitted brief statements of the public interest factors in issue to the ITC on June 15, 2021. On September 29, 2021, the ITC issued its FD finding a violation of section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act and issued (a) a limited exclusion order against Philip Morris Products S.A., prohibiting, inter alia, the importation of Platform 1 product and infringing components; and (b) a cease-and-desist order against Altria Client Services, LLC and its affiliate prohibiting, inter alia, sales of imported Platform 1 products.  The ITC predicated the orders on its finding that Platform 1 blade products infringe two patents owned by a BAT affiliate. The ITC also found that Platform 1 blade products do not infringe a third patent owned by a BAT affiliate.  The ITC further held that there were insufficient concerns over public interest to prevent the issuance of remedial orders.  Following the Presidential Review period, the orders became effective and Defendants filed a petition for review of the FD with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Defendants also filed motions in the ITC and Federal Circuit for a stay of the orders pending disposition of the appeal; the ITC denied the motion on January 20, 2022 and the Federal Circuit denied the motion on January 25, 2022.  The Federal Circuit heard oral argument on defendants' appeal of the FD on October 3, 2022 and a decision is awaited.  We estimate that an adverse ruling is probable due to our inability to import the products and components impacted by the ITC's FD with immaterial financial impact.  In the Eastern District of Virginia case, the defendants also counterclaimed that BAT infringed their patents relating to certain e-vapor products, seeking damages for, and injunctive relief against, the commercialization of these products by BAT.  The trial of Defendant PMPSA’s counterclaims took place from June 8-14, 2022 and, on June 15, 2022, the jury returned a verdict for PMPSA awarding approximately $\n10.8\nmillion in damages for infringement up to December 31, 2021 of two PMPSA patents by BAT’s affiliate and two of BAT’s e-vapor products; the jury also found BAT’s affiliate did not infringe one of the two PMPSA patents and that the BAT affiliates had failed to prove one of the two PMPSA patents was invalid. PMPSA filed a motion for an injunction or, in the alternative, an ongoing royalty on August 12, 2022 which remains pending. Upon petition of Philip Morris Products S.A., the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") of the United States Patent and Trademark Office has instituted review of certain claims pertaining to four of the six patents asserted by BAT affiliates in both proceedings. On January 11, 2022, PTAB issued its final decision on one of the two patents underlying the ITC's FD, invalidating all challenged claims of BAT's patent. On March 30, 2022, PTAB issued its final decision on the second of the two patents underlying the ITC's FD, finding the challenged claims patentable. The parties have filed appeals of these PTAB results to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On July 21, 2022, PMPSA filed a Request for Rehearing of PTAB's November 2020\n128\ndecision not to institute review of certain claims in the second of the two patents underlying the ITC's FD; PTAB denied the Request on October 13, 2022.\nIn April 2020, BAT’s affiliate commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nNicoventures Trading Limited v. PM GmbH, et al.,\nagainst PMI’s German subsidiary, Philip Morris GmbH, and Philip Morris Products S.A., in the Regional Court in Munich, Germany. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 blade products in Germany. In June 2021, the court stayed the proceeding in respect of one of the two patents asserted by BAT’s Affiliate. Following the December 2022 confirmation of the revocation of the other BAT patent by the European Patent Office Board of Appeal, BAT withdrew its initial claim based on that patent; the stayed action based on the second patent remains pending.\nIn September 2020, BAT’s affiliates commenced patent infringement and unfair competition proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Philip Morris Products S.A., et al.\n, against Philip Morris Products S.A. and PMI’s Italian subsidiaries, Philip Morris Manufacturing & Technology Bologna S.p.A. and Philip Morris Italia S.r.l., in the Court of Milan, Italy.  Plaintiffs seek damages, as well as injunctive relief against the manufacture in Italy of the Platform 1 blade heated tobacco units allegedly infringing the asserted patents and the commercialization of the Platform 1 blade products in Italy. As part of this proceeding, in October 2020, BAT’s affiliates filed a request based on one of the two asserted patents seeking preliminary injunctive relief against the manufacture and commercialization of the Platform 1 blade products in Italy.  In July 2022, the court dismissed plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunction in its entirety and plaintiffs did not appeal this ruling.\nIn October 2020, BAT’s affiliates commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Philip Morris Japan, Limited\n,\net al\n., against PMI’s Japanese subsidiary, Philip Morris Japan Limited, and a third-party distributor in the Tokyo District Court. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 blade products in Japan. On December 23, 2022, the Court dismissed BAT’s claims with respect to one of the two patents that it asserted, finding no infringement; BAT filed an appeal of this dismissal.\nIn November 2020, BAT’s affiliates commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Philip Morris Romania SRL, et al.\n, against PMI’s Romanian subsidiaries, Philip Morris Romania S.R.L. and Philip Morris Trading S.R.L., and a third-party distributor in the Court of Law of Bucharest, Civil Registry. Plaintiffs seek damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against the manufacture and commercialization of the Platform 1 blade products in Romania. In February 2021, the court dismissed plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. In April 2021, the appellate court denied plaintiffs' appeal, confirming the dismissal of plaintiffs' request for preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs' proceeding requesting damages and a permanent injunction remains pending before the Court of Law of Bucharest, Civil Registry. In an October 14, 2021 hearing, the court stayed the proceeding.\nIn March 2021, BAT’s affiliates commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Philip Morris Korea, Co., Ltd.,\nagainst PM Korea in the Seoul Central District Court.  Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 blade heated tobacco units in South Korea.  On May 30, 2022, the Korean Patent Office issued a decision that all of the challenged claims in the patent asserted by Plaintiffs are invalid; Plaintiffs filed an appeal of this decision.\nIn July, 2021, Philip Morris Products, S.A.  filed a claim at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales against BAT affiliates Nicoventures Trading Limited and British American Tobacco (Investments) Limited seeking revocation of the UK parts of two BAT European patents. In March, the BAT affiliates stated that they would consent to revocation of one of the patents and filed a counterclaim against Philip Morris Products S.A. and Philip Morris Limited seeking from the court a declaration that the remaining BAT affiliate patent is infringed by Platform 1 induction products, as well as damages and injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 induction products in the U.K. The trial took place from September 21-28, 2022, and a decision is awaited.\nOther patent challenges by both parties are pending in various jurisdictions.\nWe believe that the foregoing proceedings by the affiliates of BAT are without merit and will defend them vigorously.\nWe are also involved in additional litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business.  While the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate outcomes of other litigation, including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nThird-Party Guarantees\nUntil November 1, 2022, Medicago Inc. (\"Medicago\") was an equity method investee of Philip Morris Investments B.V. (“PMIBV”), a PMI subsidiary.  On October 17, 2020, Medicago had entered into a contribution agreement with the Canadian government (the “Contribution Agreement”) whereby the Canadian government agreed to contribute up to CAD\n173\nmillion (approximately $\n131\nmillion on the date of signing) to Medicago, to support its on-going COVID-19 vaccine development and clinical trials (\"First Stage\"), and for the construction of its Quebec City manufacturing facility (\"Second Stage\", and together with the First Stage, the “Project”).\n129\nOn March 31, 2022, the Contribution Agreement was amended (the “Contribution Agreement Amendment”) to reflect an additional contribution from the Canadian government up to CAD\n27\nmillion (approximately $\n22\nmillion on the date of signing) to Medicago for the Second Stage. In August 2022, Medicago received the final tranche of the contribution from the Canadian government in relation to the First Stage, confirming thereby the completion of such first stage and consequently reducing by approximately CAD\n123\nmillion (approximately $\n93\nmillion on the date of signing) the Repayment Obligations (as defined below).\nPMIBV and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (“MTPC”)  are also parties to the Contribution Agreement and the Contribution Agreement Amendment as guarantors of Medicago’s obligations thereunder on a joint and several basis (“Co-Guarantors”). The Co-Guarantors agreed to repay amounts contributed by the Canadian government plus interest, if Medicago fails to do so (the \"Repayment Obligations\"), and could be responsible for the costs of Medicago’s other obligations (such as the achievement of specific milestones of the Project). The guarantees are in effect through March 31, 2026. It is reasonably possible that PMI will be responsible for a portion of these costs and obligations. The maximum amount of these obligations is currently non-estimable.\nOn November 1, 2022, PMIBV transferred all of the shares it owned in Medicago to MTPC Holdings Canada Inc., the majority shareholder of Medicago. MTPC assumed and agreed to perform all of PMIBV's obligations under the guarantees and to indemnify and save PMIBV harmless in respect of any and all claims related to the guaranteed obligations.  On February 3, 2023, PMI learned through a public announcement that a decision has been taken to cease all operations at Medicago and to proceed with an orderly wind up of Medicago’s business and operations.\nPMI has determined that these guarantees did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nSale of Accounts Receivable:\nTo mitigate risk and enhance cash and liquidity management PMI sells trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions. These arrangements allow PMI to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse.  The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. PMI sells trade receivables under two types of arrangements, servicing and non-servicing.  For servicing arrangements, PMI continues to service the sold trade receivables on an administrative basis and does not act on behalf of the unaffiliated financial institutions.  When applicable, a servicing liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the servicing.  The amounts associated with the servicing liability were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.  Under the non-servicing arrangements, PMI does not provide any administrative support or servicing after the trade receivables have been sold to the unaffiliated financial institutions.\nCumulative trade receivables sold, including excise taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $\n11.9\nbillion and $\n11.8\nbillion, respectively.  PMI’s operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions.  The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $\n1.0\nbillion, $\n0.9\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion, respectively.  The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the sum of the cash received is recorded as a loss on sale of trade receivables within marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.  For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the loss on sale of trade receivables was $\n26\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, PMI did not record any charges for asset impairment and exit costs related to restructuring activities.  As previously discussed, PMI recorded a pre-tax impairment charge on intangibles of $\n112\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022 within the Wellness and Healthcare segment.  For further details, see Note 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\n.  For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, PMI recorded total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs related to\n130\nrestructuring activities of $\n216\nmillion and $\n149\nmillion, respectively.  These pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs were included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.\nSouth Korea\nIn 2021, PM Korea implemented a new business operating model, which required the restructuring of its current distribution agreements.  As a result, PMI recorded exit costs of $\n57\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2021, related to contract terminations and restructuring with certain distributors.\nOrganizational Design Optimization\nAs part of PMI’s transformation to a smoke-free future, PMI sought to optimize its organizational design, which included the elimination, relocation and outsourcing of certain operations center and centralized activities.  In January 2020, PMI commenced a multi-phase restructuring project in Switzerland.  PMI initiated the employee consultation procedures, as required under Swiss law, for the impacted employees.  The consultation procedures for the first two phases were completed in 2020 with the final phases initiated and completed in 2021. Additionally, since the commencement of this multi-phase restructuring project in 2020, PMI launched a voluntary separation program in Switzerland for certain eligible employees and announced the outsourcing of certain activities in Argentina, Indonesia, Poland and the United States. This multi-phase restructuring project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, PMI recorded pre-tax charges of $\n159\nmillion and $\n149\nmillion, respectively, related to the organizational design optimization.  Since inception of this multi-phase restructuring project in January 2020 through December 31, 2021, approximately\n1,020\npositions in total were impacted, resulting in cumulative pre-tax charges of $\n308\nmillion related to the organizational design optimization program.  Of this cumulative pre-tax amount, $\n300\nmillion related to separation program charges and $\n8\nmillion related to asset impairment charges.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs by Segment\nDuring 2021 and 2020, PMI recorded the following pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs by segment related to restructuring activities:\n(1)\nOrganizational design optimization pre-tax charges in 2021 and 2020 were allocated across all geographical segments.\n131\nMovement in Exit Cost Liabilities\nThe movement in exit cost liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows:\nFuture cash payments for exit costs incurred to date are anticipated to be substantially paid by the end of 2023.\nLeases:\nPMI has operating and finance leases that are principally for real estate (office space, warehouses and retail store space), machinery and equipment, and vehicles.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Swedish Match AB from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Swedish Match AB from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Swedish Match AB is a majority-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total third-party net revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 4% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\n134\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nTobacco-Related Litigation for Smoking and Health Class Actions and Health Care Cost Recovery Actions\nAs desc\nribed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has 9 smoking and health class actions and 17 health care cost recovery actions pending.  The Company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when management determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Except as stated otherwise in Note 18, w\nhile it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available, (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to tobacco-related litigation for smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when determining the probability of a loss being incurred and an estimate of the amount or range of the potential loss for each case, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity, judgment and effort in evaluating management’s assessment related to the loss contingencies associated with smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions related claims.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions, including controls over determining the probability and range of loss as well as controls over financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external and internal legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions contingencies disclosures.\nPreliminary Valuation of Trademarks and Customer Relationships - Acquisition of Swedish Match AB\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Swedish Match AB for consideration of $14.5 billion in 2022, which resulted in $4.5 billion of intangible assets preliminarily being recorded, of which $4.1 billion relate to trademarks and customer relationships. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the preliminary fair value of intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for trademarks, and profit margins, customer attrition rates, and discount rates for customer relationships.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the preliminary valuation of trademarks and customer relationships acquired in the acquisition of Swedish Match AB is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the preliminary fair value estimate of the trademarks and customer relationships acquired, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions of revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for trademarks, and profit margins, customer attrition rates, and\n135\ndiscount rates for customer relationships. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s preliminary valuation of the trademarks and customer relationships acquired and controls over the development of significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, profit margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the preliminary fair value of trademarks and customer relationships. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, profit margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates and profit margins involved considering the past performance of the acquired business, as well as economic and industry forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s valuation methods, the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, and the reasonableness of the customer attrition rate, royalty rate, and discount rate assumptions.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\n136\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI” or \"we\") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. PMI’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PMI;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of PMI are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of PMI; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn November 2022 we acquired Swedish Match.  We have excluded the Swedish Match acquisition from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Total assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets (which are included in our assessment) represent 4% of consolidated assets as of December 31, 2022. Total third-party net revenues represent 1% of consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nBased on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2022, PMI maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers SA, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of PMI included in this report, has audited the effectiveness of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2022, as stated in their report herein.\nFebruary 10, 2023\n137"

Based upon that evaluation, PMI’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that PMI’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There have been no changes in PMI’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PMI’s internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Swedish Match, management is in the process of analyzing, evaluating and where necessary, implementing changes in controls and procedures.  This may result in additions or changes to PMI’s internal control over financial reporting.  The Swedish Match acquisition has been excluded from the Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are included in Item 8."
