For further information on sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration.\nCOMPETITIVE CONDITIONS\nWe compete with many companies in the defense, intelligence and federal civil markets. The Boeing Company, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon Technologies are some of our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. government procurement awards).\nIt is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, serve as a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.\nSEASONALITY\nNo material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.\n-5-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nBACKLOG\nAt December 31, 2022, total backlog, which is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations, was $78.7 billion as compared with $76.0 billion at December 31, 2021. For further information, see “Backlog” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe routinely apply for and own a number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop. We also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties. The U.S. government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property.\nRAW MATERIALS\nWe have experienced challenges with access to certain raw materials due to macroeconomic factors and several global events such as microelectronics shortages, COVID-19 and geopolitical conflicts. In some cases, these challenges have significantly increased the cost and/or lead time required to obtain certain raw materials. Nonetheless, these challenges have not to date materially impacted our ability to perform on our contracts. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nFostering a culture that offers employees opportunities to live our values, deliver for our customers, and act responsibly and sustainably is central to our diverse and talented workforce. Our culture and values enable us to continue attracting qualified talent, particularly those with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, engineering and math. During 2022, despite facing a tight labor market, this focus on our culture and workforce was a factor in our ability to hire approximately 16,000 new employees, and as of December 31, 2022, we have approximately 95,000 employees.\nAdditional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report and Proxy Statement, which can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our ESG Report (formerly our Sustainability Report), is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nOur Values and Culture\nOur values reflect our priorities and form the bedrock of our culture:\n•\nWe do the right thing – we earn trust, act with ethics, integrity and transparency, treat everyone with respect, value diversity and foster safe and inclusive environments.\n•\nWe do what we promise – we own the delivery of results, focused on quality.\n•\nWe commit to shared success – we work together to focus on the mission and take accountability for the sustainable success of our people, customers, shareholders, suppliers and communities.\n•\nWe pioneer – with fierce curiosity, dedication and innovation, we seek to solve the world’s most challenging problems.\nWe believe our culture and values are vital to the ongoing success of the company, including our ability to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce. Our values are also integral to our commitment to long-term sustainability, with robust ESG practices across our company. The company has a Standards of Business Conduct program. Our employees are empowered to raise concerns without fear of reprisal. In addition to full-time ethics professionals, we also have over 140 business conduct advisors who promote values and an ethical culture within the company.\nOur annual engagement survey gives employees a voice and a mechanism to provide feedback on our culture. This survey is managed by a third-party vendor to encourage employee candor on key engagement drivers, including company leadership, culture, inclusion and career development. In 2022, 79 percent of employees responded to the survey, an indication that our employees believe their feedback matters, and we were named a “High Performing\n-6-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCompany” by the third party vendor based on our survey results. Our leaders review the survey responses and work collaboratively with their teams to take meaningful actions based on survey results.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) is vital to our culture and our company’s success. Our ability to leverage the power of our diverse workforce enhances employee engagement and enables us to innovate, perform and deliver on quality, which results in value for our shareholders, customers, and employees. Diversity is one of the company’s non-financial ESG performance metrics and is reviewed by the Board of Directors. Across our U.S. employee population, as of December 31, 2022, 25 percent are female, 37 percent are people of color, 18 percent are veterans and 8 percent are persons with disabilities. At the vice president level, 34 percent are female and 19 percent are people of color.\nTalent Management\nNorthrop Grumman’s talent strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our people and our business. We are focused on providing an end-to-end experience from pre-hire to retirement. This includes creating inclusive, employee-centric experiences, cultivating leadership, offering multiple development pathways and expanding the talent pipeline into and through the company.\nWe hold regular talent review discussions to ensure line of sight to talent at various levels of the organization. Succession plans are refreshed and reviewed to ensure a robust, diverse pipeline of talent and business continuity with a tight linkage to development.\nWe focus on accelerating learning and development of our leaders by providing a combination of experiences and education. Our Leading for Impact Program offers developmental paths for new and experienced managers seeking to refresh or build their leadership capabilities. Nearly 3,000 leaders have honed their skills leveraging various learning modalities, including virtual and in-person instructor-led, web-based training and micro-courses to support our managers.\nOur employee development programs are designed to strengthen employee skills that align to our current and future business needs, encourage knowledge sharing and support career progression and growth. We utilize My Learning Experience, a machine learning enabled content aggregator designed to create a unique and personalized learning experience for each employee. We offer our employees online career-specific tools and resources and we also support development opportunities through educational institutions with our Education Assistance Program. Our early-in-career rotation program, Pathways, develops talent pipelines with both depth of skills and breadth of experiences that are critical to the company’s future talent needs. Our technical cohort programs are uniquely designed to cultivate technical, domain expertise and collaborative thought leadership for early through advanced career levels.\nAs our company continues to grow, we rely on an integrated talent acquisition approach. The company strategically attracts, identifies, and onboards candidates in support of business needs and priorities. In order to accomplish our goals, we seek talent with unique perspectives, skills and experiences; maintain strategic relationships with colleges; offer a robust employee referral program; and partner with numerous diversity organizations, military organizations and trusted external partners, with a commitment to growing and supporting a diverse talent pipeline. Amidst the evolving and, at times, challenging hiring environment, we apply agile recruiting methods as we work to adapt to the changing labor marketplace and to ensure employees and candidates have an exceptional experience.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nPeople are our most valuable resource, and we work diligently to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, visitors and others at our facilities. During 2022, we have taken, and continue to take, robust actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees and others. See “COVID-19” in MD&A for further discussion.\nHealth and safety are a core focus in everything we do. Risk and hazard identification, abatement and prevention are key components of Northrop Grumman’s safety program. Everyone has a responsibility to identify workplace hazards and we empower employees to report these hazards without fear of repercussion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our health and safety programs externally, through benchmarking with industry peers and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Internally, we determine program effectiveness by conducting trend analyses of our past performance.\n-7-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCollective Agreements\nApproximately 4,000 employees are covered by 15 collective agreements in the U.S., of which we negotiated four renewals in 2022 and expect to negotiate one renewal in 2023.\nSee “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to our workforce and employee relations.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nGovernment Contract Security Restrictions\nWe are prohibited by the U.S. government from publicly discussing the details of certain classified programs. These programs are generally referred to as “restricted” in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements and financial information in this Annual Report reflect the operating results of our entire company, including restricted programs.\nContracts\nWe generate the majority of our business from long-term contracts with the U.S. government for development, production and support activities. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which are regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts. Examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the U.S. government in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements include, but are not limited to, unallowable employee compensation, charitable donations, interest expense, advertising, and certain legal and travel costs.\nWe monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).\nOur long-term contracts typically fall into one of two contract types:\nCost-type contracts\n– Cost-type contracts include cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts. Cost-type contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee. As a result, cost-type contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation. Fees on cost-type contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees, which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met. Award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.\nFixed-price contracts\n– Firm fixed-price contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated amount and not typically subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, absent changes by the customer. As a result, fixed-price contracts typically have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth, but provide the opportunity for higher profit margins. Certain fixed-price incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount, typically through a cost-sharing ratio that affects profitability. These contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share ceiling is reached. Time-and-materials contracts are considered fixed-price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.\nProfit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on, among other things, the contract type, contract phase (e.g., development, low-rate production or mature production), negotiated fee arrangements, achievement of performance objectives, unexpected macroeconomic factors or other circumstances, and cost, schedule and technical performance.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and “Risk Factors” for further information regarding our contracts and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for sales by contract type.\n-8-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe following table summarizes sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, recognized by contract type and customer category:\n(1)\nSales to the U.S. government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. government. Each of the company’s segments derives substantial revenue from the U.S. government.\n(2)\nInternational sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer. These sales include foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and enforcement actions relating to protection of the environment. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments. See “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding environmental matters.\nIn 2022, we announced our next generation environmental sustainability goals. These goals focus on Northrop Grumman’s facilities in addition to supply chain partners and customers:\n•\nNet zero greenhouse gas emissions in operations by 2035;\n•\nSource 50 percent of total electricity from renewable sources by 2030;\n•\nStrengthen leadership in operational footprint reduction through setting and achieving pioneering targets in environmental stewardship by 2025, including potable water use and solid waste to landfill;\n•\nIn collaboration with key customers, work to develop a pioneering product stewardship program focused on material efficiency, product design and life cycle assessment;\n•\nUpdate the company’s \"Standards of Business Conduct for Suppliers and Other Trading Partners\" to incorporate industry-leading sustainability practices by 2023;\n•\nExpand Technology for Conservation initiatives in proximity to Northrop Grumman's U.S. locations by 2030, in collaboration with external partners.\nAdditional information regarding our environmental sustainability goals is available in our ESG Report, which can be found on our company website.\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nSee “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for information about our executive officers.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur principal executive offices are located at 2980 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, Virginia 22042.

Changes in this customer’s priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur primary customer is the U.S. government, from which we derived 86 percent of our sales in 2022; we have a number of large programs with the U.S. Department of the Air Force, in particular. The U.S. government has the ability to delay, modify or cancel ongoing competitions, procurements and programs, as well as to change its future acquisition strategy. We cannot predict the impact on existing, follow-on, replacement or future programs from potential changes in the threat environment, defense spending levels, government priorities, political leadership, procurement practices and strategy, inflation and other macroeconomic trends, military strategy; or broader changes in social, economic or political demands and priorities.\nThe U.S. government has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, for its convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned. In the event of termination due to default, contractors may be required to pay for re-procurement costs in excess of the original contract price, net of the value of work accepted from the original contract, as well as other damages. Termination due to our default (or that of a teammate) could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience. The U.S. government has invoked and could invoke this ability across a limited or broad number of contracts. In the event of a stop work order, contractors are typically protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work plus a reasonable fee. However, such temporary stoppages often introduce inefficiencies and result in financial and other damages for which contractors may not be able to negotiate full recovery. In some cases, they have also ultimately resulted and could result in termination of a contract for convenience or reduced future orders.\nA significant shift in government priorities, programs or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. government funding more broadly, including a prolonged continuing resolution or breach of the debt ceiling, can negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nU.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, Congress appropriates funds annually even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Programs are often partially funded initially, with additional funds committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. When we or our subcontractors incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we are generally at risk for reimbursement unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract. We cannot predict what funding will ultimately be approved for individual programs. In addition, pressures on, as well as laws and plans relating to the federal budget, potential changes in priorities and defense spending, the timing and substance of the appropriations process, use of continuing resolutions (with restrictions, e.g., on new starts) and the federal debt limit (including a breach), have adversely affected and could adversely affect the amount and timing of funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payments by our customers. In the event government\n-10-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nfunding for our significant programs is reduced, delayed or unavailable, or orders are reduced, our contracts or subcontracts, or competitions for such programs have at times been, and in the future may be, terminated or changed.\nThe U.S. continues to face an uncertain and changing political environment, along with substantial fiscal and economic challenges, which affect funding. The budget and macroeconomic environment, political instability, and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes and the debt ceiling, remain significant short and long-term risks. See “Overview” in MD&A. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold. If annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted, the U.S. government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on budgets, and we may face a prolonged government shutdown that could lead to program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the U.S. government’s ability to progress programs and make timely payments. A prolonged shutdown could limit our ability to perform on our contracts and successfully compete for new work. If the statutory debt limit is not increased adequately, we could be obligated to work without receiving timely payments. A prolonged breach could have far-reaching adverse consequences. If current macroeconomic pressures (especially from inflation and labor and supply chain challenges) are prolonged or worsen, and increased costs continue, then existing or anticipated appropriated and contracted funds may not be sufficient to cover costs incurred on existing or future programs. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2023 grants DoD discretionary authority under limited circumstances to provide extraordinary relief to contractors to address certain inflationary impacts under the current macroeconomic environment for FY 2023. This or other relief may not be available or adequate to address the significant impacts of the broader macroeconomic environment.\nFuture funding for certain programs in which we participate may be reduced, delayed or cancelled. Budget cuts globally could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers. While we believe that our business is well-positioned in areas for future defense spending, changing priorities, budget pressures, defense spending cuts, challenges in the appropriations process, the possibility of a year-long continuing resolution and breach of the debt ceiling, ongoing fiscal debates and the global economic environment increase uncertainties and risk.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our current and future programs; long-term funding under a continuing resolution; an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown; and/or future budget and program decisions, among other items, may negatively impact our business and programs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nWe use estimates when accounting for contracts. Contract cost growth or changes in estimated contract revenues and costs can affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nContract accounting requires judgment, including in assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and predicting future performance. Given the size and nature of our many contracts, estimating total revenues and costs at completion is complex and subject to many variables. When there is sufficient information to assess expected future performance, we consider performance related incentives, awards and penalties in estimating revenue and profit rates. Suppliers’ expected performance, and the availability and costs of labor, materials and components, are also considered.\nOur operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase, especially without comparable increases in revenue. There are many reasons estimated contract costs can increase. They include: macroeconomic trends (including inflation, labor shortages and supply chain challenges); delays or limitations in customer funding; design or other development challenges; production challenges (including from technical or quality issues and other performance concerns); inability to realize learning curves or other cost savings; changes in laws or regulations; actions necessary for long-term customer satisfaction; global pandemics, such as COVID-19; and natural disasters or environmental matters. For example, as discussed in greater detail in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, our latest estimated cost to complete the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase of the B-21 program reflects updated estimates for adverse impacts from these macroeconomic factors, as well as potential opportunities to address them.\nWe aim to mitigate this risk through contract terms, and we have filed and may file requests for equitable adjustment or claims to seek recovery in whole or in part for our increased costs. We have also sought, and will seek, other avenues, as appropriate, to compensate the company for certain unexpected cost increases. However, our contracts may not enable full recovery, and/or the government may disagree with our requests and may not have funding to cover them.\n-11-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nOur risk varies with the type of contract. Fixed-price contracts inherently tend to have more financial risk than cost-type contracts, including as a result of inflationary pressures, labor rates and shortages, and supplier challenges. In 2022, approximately half of our sales were derived from fixed-price contracts. We have more often entered into fixed-price contracts where costs can be more reasonably estimated based on actual experience, such as for mature production programs. However, our customers may also seek fixed-price contracts for development programs, combined development and production programs, or low-rate initial production programs, where the risks are greater. In addition, our contracts contain provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights. If we do not achieve our estimates or meet terms in our contracts, our profitability has at times been and may be reduced, and we have incurred and may incur losses.\nCertain of our fixed-price contracts include or may include fixed-price development work. This work is inherently more uncertain, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in estimates of the costs to complete the development stage. As work progresses into production, the risks associated with estimating total costs are typically reduced. While management uses its best judgment to estimate costs associated with fixed-price contracts, future events could result in significant adjustments.\nUnder cost-type contracts, allowable costs are generally subject to reimbursement plus a fee. We often enter into cost-type contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are uncertain and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract. In these cases, the financial risks are typically in recognizing profit, which ultimately may not be earned, or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise. We also face additional financial risk when solicitations require us to bid on cost-type development work and fixed-price production lots and/or options in one submission, or cost-type development work requiring us to provide certain items at our expense or with little or no fee. Ongoing macroeconomic challenges increase these risks.\nBecause of the significance of management’s judgments and the estimation processes, and the difficulties inherent in estimating future costs, particularly in a challenging macroeconomic environment, it is possible that we could see materially different results. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates, and the failure to prevail on claims could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of one or more of our contracts and on our overall financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. See “Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments” in MD&A and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n▪\nThe global macroeconomic environment could negatively impact our business and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the global macroeconomic environment. The global macroeconomic environment has experienced, and continues to experience, extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation; widespread disruptions in supply chains; workforce challenges, including labor shortages; and market volatility. These challenges have, among other things, led to increased costs, labor and supply shortages, and delays and disruption in performance, as well as competing demands for scarce resources. Those challenges have adversely impacted our customers, our industry, our company, our suppliers and others with whom we do business. While some aspects of the macroeconomic environment appear to be improving, and we have been able to mitigate some of the challenges (especially with respect to labor shortages), other challenges persist. We cannot predict the future trajectory of this risk, including how the macroeconomic environment will evolve or how it will continue to impact us.\nWe (including our suppliers and other partners) have and may continue to experience inflationary pressures, supply chain disruption and labor and material cost increases at a rate higher than anticipated. Given the nature of our business and our contracts (many of which are fixed price and of long duration), we may be unable to recover some of these increased costs or to offset such costs with greater than expected efficiencies. Our government customers are likely to continue to face competing priorities and increased demands for their limited resources. We cannot predict how long these challenges will persist or how they will change over time. We continue to work proactively to mitigate these challenges. However, if we are unable to do so successfully, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n▪\nCompetition within our markets and bid protests may affect our ability to win new contracts and result in reduced revenues and market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more financial capacity or more extensive or specialized engineering, manufacturing, or marketing capabilities. They may be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts. We have seen, and anticipate we will continue to see, increased\n-12-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ncompetition in some of our core markets, especially as a result of our customers’ budget pressures, their focus on affordability and competition, and our own success in winning business. We are facing increasing competition in the U.S. and outside the U.S. from U.S., foreign and multinational firms, including new entrants. We are also facing increasing competition for, and more limited access to various critical products, services and other supplies. In some instances, foreign companies may receive loans, subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies and foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer. Some customers, including the DoD, are turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for some products and services, and continue to utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally. In addition, our success in competing and remaining cost-competitive depends, in part, on our ability successfully to effect our digital transformation strategy and to adopt and integrate new digital manufacturing and operating technologies into our products and services.\nBid protests can result in contract modifications or the award decision being reversed and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in such a loss, it can delay execution and earnings.\nIf we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, or prevail in protests, or to prevail against other attempts to interfere with our ability to obtain and retain awards, we may experience declines in future revenues and market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n▪\nWe are subject to various investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us particularly susceptible to investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, prosecutions, litigation and other legal proceedings (collectively “legal proceedings”), particularly those involving governments, which have at times been, and may continue to be, increasingly aggressive. We are and may become subject to legal proceedings globally (including criminal, civil and administrative) and across a broad array of matters, including, but not limited to, government contracts, cost accounting, financial accounting or reporting, commercial transactions, false statements or claims, pension accounting, antitrust, compliance with government orders, mischarging, security (cyber and physical), performance, fraud, procurement integrity, securities laws and requirements, products liability, warranties, hazardous materials, personal injury claims, environmental (including remediation and toxic torts), shareholder derivative actions, M&A, intellectual property, tax, corporate law, employees, export/import, anti-corruption, debt and equity, labor, health and safety, the COVID-19 pandemic and the company’s response to it, accidents, launch failures, employee benefits and plans, including pension plans and plan administration, improper payments, and privacy, as well as matters relating to the Orbital ATK Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decision and order. These matters can divert resources; result in administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions (including judgments, convictions, consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements), compensatory, treble or other damages, non-monetary relief, or other liabilities; and otherwise harm our business and our ability to obtain and retain awards. Certain allegations may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges for the company or one or more of its components. Suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on the company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations. An investigation, claim, dispute, enforcement action or litigation, even if pending or not ultimately substantiated or if fully indemnified or insured, can negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it substantially more difficult for us to compete effectively for business, obtain and retain awards, ensure adequate funding for our programs or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding investigations, claims and litigation.\n▪\nThe improper conduct of employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures in which we participate can impact our reputation, our ability to do business and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe have implemented policies, training and other compliance controls, and have negotiated terms designed to prevent misconduct by employees, agents or others working with us or on our behalf that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing improper payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled or classified information, false claims, procurement integrity, cost accounting and billing, competition, information security and data privacy, intellectual property and\n-13-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ncontract terms. However, we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees, agents, suppliers, partners or others working with us or on our behalf. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such misconduct, despite a vigorous compliance program, our values and strong culture. This risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand globally, with greater opportunities and demands to do more business with local and new partners, and in new environments. At the same time, law enforcement agencies are continuing to focus collaboratively on combating global corruption and other misconduct. In the ordinary course we form and are members of joint ventures (with that term used throughout to refer to joint efforts or business arrangements of any type). Notwithstanding our robust processes, we are unable to prevent any and all misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures (including their officers, directors and employees) or our partners. Improper actions by our employees or those with whom or through whom we do business subjects us to risk of administrative, civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions; monetary and non-monetary penalties; liabilities; and the loss of privileges and other sanctions, including suspension and debarment, which could negatively impact our reputation and ability to conduct business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we and our partners are subject to various procurement and other laws, regulations and contract terms applicable to our industry, as well as those more broadly applicable to industry, and we could be adversely affected by changes in such laws, regulations or terms, or any negative findings by the U.S. government as to our compliance with them. We also may be adversely affected by changes in our customers’ business practices globally.\nU.S. government contractors (including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business) must comply with various specific procurement laws, regulations, rules and other legal requirements, as well as ones more broadly applicable. These various legal requirements, although sometimes customary in government contracting, increase costs and risks. They have been and are evolving at a significant pace. The costs are not always fully recoverable. New laws or other requirements, or changes to existing ones (including, for example, related to cyber, information protection, cost accounting, climate, environment, COVID-19, securities, competition, compensation costs, taxes, counterfeit parts, pensions, and use of certain non-US equipment) or changes in how government agencies interpret existing ones, can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the DCAA, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the DoD Inspector General. These agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and accounting, and our compliance, and the adequacy of our systems in meeting government requirements. Costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated may not be reimbursed or may be refunded. When an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we are subject to possible civil and criminal penalties, sanctions, or suspension or debarment. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems to be inadequate, with significant financial impact, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, we risk serious reputational harm in situations involving allegations of impropriety made against us or our business partners.\nOur industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices globally, in part as a result of changes in the global security and threat environment and an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies, business systems, recovery of costs and a reprioritization of available defense funds. We have experienced and may continue to experience an increased number of audits and challenges to our claims and our business systems for current and past years, as well as longer periods to close audits, broader requests for information and an increased risk of withholdings of payments. For example, the thresholds for certain allowable costs have been reduced; and the allowability of other costs and how the company treated them, including certain costs related to pensions, and certain assumptions used by the company to determine pension expense, are being challenged and investigated, all with risks and costs to the company. The U.S. government is also pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to the contractor. The U.S. government has been pursuing and may continue to pursue policies that could negatively impact our profitability. Changes in procurement practices, including those favoring incentive-based fee arrangements; fixed price development or long-term production programs; different award criteria; non-traditional contract provisions; and contract negotiation offers that indicate what our costs should be, have affected and may in the future affect our profitability and predictability.\nWe (again, including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business) also are subject to, and expected to perform in compliance with, a vast array of federal, state and local laws, regulations, contract terms and requirements related to our industry, our products and the businesses we operate, as well as those more broadly applicable to industry, such as securities laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not\n-14-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nlimited to, the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act, False Claims Act, Procurement Integrity Act, CAS, FAR/DFAR, export controls and international sanctions, FCPA (and similar anti-corruption provisions) and SEC rules and regulations, as well as those related to pandemics. These requirements, whether specific to our industry or broadly applicable, may limit our ability to achieve our goals. If we are found to have violated any such requirements, or are found not to have acted responsibly, we may be subject to a wide array of actions, including contract modifications or termination; payment withholds; the loss of export/import privileges; administrative, civil or criminal judgments or penalties (including convictions, agreements, fines, damages and non-monetary relief); or suspension or debarment.\nIf we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws, regulations, rules, contract terms and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly, including with respect to allowable costs, it could affect our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nEnvironmental matters, including unforeseen costs associated with compliance and remediation efforts, and government and third party claims, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including as they may be expanded, otherwise changed or enforced differently over time. Compliance with these existing and evolving environmental laws and regulations requires, and is expected to continue to require, significant operating and capital costs. We may be subject to substantial administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions (including suspension and debarment) for violations. If we are found to be in violation of the Federal Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the Environmental Protection Agency on a list of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on U.S. government contracts until the violation is corrected.\nWe incur, and expect to continue to incur, substantial remediation costs related to the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. Stricter or different remediation standards or enforcement of existing laws and regulations; new requirements, including regulation of new substances; discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination or new contaminants; imposition of fines, penalties, or damages (including natural resource damages); a determination that certain remediation or other costs are unallowable; rulings on allocation or insurance coverage; and/or the insolvency, inability or unwillingness of other parties to pay their share, could require us to incur material additional costs in excess of those anticipated.\nWe are and may become a party to various legal proceedings and disputes involving government and private parties (including individual and class actions) relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment, including bodily injury and property damage. These matters could result in material compensatory or other damages, remediation costs, penalties, and non-monetary relief, and adverse determinations on allowability or insurance coverage.\nThe company is engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former United States Navy and Grumman facilities in Bethpage, New York. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, as included in Note 12, substantial remediation costs related to the legacy Bethpage environmental conditions. It is also possible that applicable remediation standards and other requirements to which we are subject may continue to change, and our costs may increase materially. In 2022, the company entered into a consent decree with the State of New York and reached agreements with the Department of Defense and Bethpage and South Farmingdale Water Districts to resolve claims involving these parties. In addition, we are a party to, and may become a party to, various legal proceedings with individual and class action plaintiffs alleging personal injury and property damage, as well as with insurance carriers and other parties.\nGovernment and private parties also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities or obligations related to former operations that have been divested or spun-off and/or for which we believe other parties have agreed to be responsible and/or to indemnify us. These rights may not be sufficient to protect us.\nThe impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could harm our reputation and business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, have affected and\n-15-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ncould affect our tax expense. In addition, the final determination of any tax audits or related litigation, in particular with regard to our positions on research credits and timing of revenue recognition under IRC Section 451(b), could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nAs a result of our acquisition of OATK in 2018, we may be subject to future tax audits and legal challenges involving OATK (including its subsidiaries and their successors) or the spinoff of its then subsidiary Vista Outdoor, and we may be unable to obtain indemnification or we may be required to indemnify Vista.\nChanges in our tax provisions or an increase in our tax liabilities, whether due to changes in applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation or application thereof, or a final determination of tax audits or litigation or agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n▪\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, especially of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Since first reported in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, including millions of confirmed cases and deaths, business slowdowns or shutdowns, labor shortages, supply chain challenges, changes in government spending and requirements, regulatory challenges, inflationary pressures and market volatility. As discussed in our prior and current Form 10-K and 10-Q filings, our operations have been and we expect will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic challenges. However, the company has worked hard to address and mitigate adverse impacts from COVID-19, and we do not currently anticipate significant additional direct impacts from the pandemic itself on our operations. Nonetheless, we cannot predict the future course of events.\nIf, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, due to spread, new or additional variants, or if a new health epidemic or outbreak were to occur, we likely would experience broad and varied impacts, including potentially to our workforce and supply chain, with inflationary pressures and increased costs (which may or may not be fully recoverable or insured), schedule or production delays, market volatility and other financial impacts. If any or all of these items were to occur, we could experience adverse impacts on our overall performance, operations and financial results. Given the tremendous uncertainties and variables, we cannot at this time predict the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, or any future health epidemics, pandemics or similar outbreaks, but any one could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\nAs a defense contractor, we face significant cyber and other security threats. They include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or otherwise compromise the integrity, confidentiality and/or availability of our systems, hardware and networks, and the information on them; insider threats; ransomware; threats to the safety of our directors, officers and employees; threats to our facilities, infrastructure, products (we produce and use), and subcontractors or other suppliers (referred to inclusively as suppliers); and threats from terrorist acts, espionage, civil unrest and other acts of aggression. We are also subject to increasing government, customer and other cyber and security requirements, including disclosure obligations.\nWe have robust measures in place to address and mitigate cyber-related risks. However, we have experienced cyber attacks and expect we will continue to experience additional attacks in the future, including from nation states and criminal actors. We continue to invest in the cybersecurity and resiliency of our networks and products and to enhance our internal controls and processes, which are designed to help protect our systems and infrastructure, and the information they contain. These include timely detection of incidents through monitoring, training, incident response capabilities, and mitigating cyber and security risks to our data, systems, products and services. We also partner with the government and others in our industry to help protect national security. However, given the complex and evolving nature of cyber and other security threats, including threats from targeting by more advanced and persistent adversaries, including nation states, these efforts may not be fully effective, particularly against previously unknown vulnerabilities that could go undetected for an extended period.\nOur customers and partners (including our suppliers and joint ventures) to whom we entrust confidential data, and on whom we rely to provide products and services, face similar threats and growing requirements, including ones for which others may seek to hold us responsible. We depend on our customers, suppliers, and other business partners to implement adequate controls and safeguards to protect against and report cyber incidents. If they fail to deter, detect\n-16-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nor report cyber incidents in a timely manner, we may suffer financial and other harm, including to our information, operations, performance, employees and reputation.\nAlthough we implement various measures and controls to monitor and mitigate risks associated with these threats and to increase the cyber resiliency of our infrastructure and products, there can be no assurance that these processes will be sufficient. Successful attacks could lead to losses or misuse of sensitive information or capabilities; theft or corruption of data; harm to personnel, infrastructure or products; financial costs and liabilities; protracted disruptions in our operations and performance; and the misuse of our products, as well as damage to our reputation as a provider of cyber-related or cyber-protected goods and services. We have not always been able to and may in the future not always be able to obtain adequate insurance to cover our losses.\nCyber threats, both on premises and in the cloud, are evolving and include, but are not limited to: malicious software, destructive malware, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, disruption to operations, critical systems or denial of service attacks; unauthorized release of confidential, personal or other protected information (ours or that of our employees, customers or partners); corruption of data, networks or systems; harm to individuals; and loss of assets. We have been and could be impacted by cyber threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products or services we use or in our internal, partners’ or customers’ systems that are used in connection with our business. Some of these threats are zero-day attacks associated with previously unknown vulnerabilities in third party software or products we utilize in our business. Cyber events, if not prevented or effectively mitigated, have caused and could cause harm and require remedial actions. They could also damage our reputation, disrupt performance, impact our ability to obtain future insurance coverage, and lead to loss of business, regulatory actions, liabilities or other financial losses, for which we do not have adequate sources of recovery.\nWe also face threats to our physical security, including to our facilities and the safety and well-being of our people. These threats could involve terrorism, insider threats, workplace violence, civil unrest, natural disasters, damaging weather, or fires, which could adversely affect our company. Our customers and suppliers face similar risks that, if realized, could also adversely impact our operations. Such acts could cause delays, manufacturing downtime, or other impacts that could detrimentally impact our ability to perform our operations. We could also incur unanticipated costs to remediate impacts and lost business.\nWe provide systems, products and services to various customers who also face cyber threats. Our systems, products and services may not be able to detect or deter threats, or effectively to mitigate resulting losses. These losses could adversely affect our customers and our company.\nWe also face increasing and evolving disclosure obligations related to cyber and other security events. Despite rigorous processes, we risk failing to meet all of our existing or future disclosure obligations and/or having our disclosures misinterpreted.\nThe occurrence and impact of these various risks are difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nOur ability to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce.\nOur operating results and growth opportunities are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified and diverse personnel who are or can reasonably be cleared (and obtain program access), who have the requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, engineering and math, and who share our values and are able to operate effectively consistent with our culture. Outside the U.S., it is increasingly important that we are also able to attract and retain personnel with relevant local qualifications and experience. We continue to face increased competition for talent, both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies, globally, and with increasing wage rates. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have faced labor shortages, as a result of both absenteeism among our workforce and a tight labor market more broadly, among other factors. While we continue to have labor challenges, they seem to be lessening, as we are realizing benefits from extensive hiring and retention programs. Of course the risk of insufficient personnel may again increase, either broadly or with respect to select critical staffing requirements.\nIf necessary qualified personnel are more scarce or more difficult to attract or retain under reasonable terms, or if we experience a high level of attrition, generally or in particular areas, or if such personnel are increasingly unable to obtain security clearances or program access on a timely basis or are unable to be timely and effectively trained, we would expect higher labor-related costs and we could face challenges performing on various of our programs and meeting financial expectations. In addition, the macroeconomic environment, including continued challenges in the global labor market, may further affect our ability to hire,\n-17-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ndevelop and retain the necessary talented and diverse workforce, and to maintain performance levels and our corporate culture. These challenges may be further compounded by a significant element of remote work. There is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our diversity, equity and inclusion objectives or, more broadly, to meet sustainability goals increasingly required by our shareholders, employees, the government and other stakeholders.\nCertain of our employees are covered by collective agreements. We generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities. However, the environment appears to be shifting, and if, for example, we experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiations of existing collective agreements, or if our employees pursue new collective representation, we could incur additional expenses and may be subject to work stoppages or other labor-related disruptions. Any such expenses or delays could adversely affect our performance and results.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position or achieve our results, and it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nOur earnings and profitability depend, in part, on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viability as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.\nWe rely on other companies to provide raw materials, chemicals and components and subsystems for our products, produce hardware elements and sub-assemblies, provide software and intellectual property, provide information about the parts they supply to us, and perform some of the services we need for our operations or provide to our customers, and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and contract terms, while maintaining strong values and cultures. Disruptions or performance problems with our subcontractors or other suppliers (referred to inclusively as suppliers), unanticipated cost growth for the products and services they provide, failure to meet regulatory or contractual requirements, unethical behavior, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our suppliers, have had and may continue to have various adverse impacts on the company, including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers and financial expectations. This risk of delays and disruptions in the supply chain, and supply chain challenges more broadly, has been and continues to be significantly heightened globally, in the current macroeconomic environment.\nOur ability to perform our obligations on time is adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon products, materials or information, or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner. Changes in political or economic conditions, including changes in demand, changes in the macroeconomic environment (including inflation and labor and supply chain challenges), changes in defense budgets and/or priorities, changes in export/import restrictions, evolving requirements, or changes in access to critical technology and materials (including metals and components), among others, have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the financial stability of our suppliers and/or their ability to perform effectively. The inability of our suppliers to perform effectively has required and may require us to provide them additional support and/or to transition to alternate suppliers, if available, with additional costs and delays. We expect we will need to continue to provide additional resources to support certain of our suppliers in performing under our contracts. In addition, if we are unable to do that, we may face additional losses and liabilities under our current contracts and adversely impact the prospects for certain new ones.\nIn connection with our U.S. government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer. For example, we require assured access to certain microelectronics. Our ability to produce and/or deliver products will be significantly impacted if the microelectronics manufacturing supply chain is cut off or significantly delayed. We and our suppliers are also facing increased regulatory requirements globally. We may be held responsible not only for our compliance, but that of our suppliers. For some components, there has been or may be only one supplier, or one domestic supplier. If that supplier cannot meet our needs, we may be unable to find a suitable alternative and to meet our obligations.\nOur procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk we procure counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials. We rely on our suppliers also to comply with applicable laws and contract terms, to ensure the quality of their components and effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions to their performance.\nIf our suppliers are not financially viable, incur increased costs of delays, fail to comply with legal requirements, or otherwise fail to address these risks and meet their obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n-18-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n•\nRisks associated with environmental, social and governance matters (ESG), including especially climate change and other environmental impacts, and increased focus and evolving views of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders on these issues, could negatively affect our business and operations.\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters significantly impact our business and operations and present evolving risks and challenges. Environmental impacts, including climate change specifically, create short and long-term financial risks to our business globally. We have significant operations located in regions that have been, and may in the future be, exposed to significant weather events and other natural disasters. Climate related changes can impact natural disasters, including weather patterns, with the increased frequency and severity of significant weather events (e.g., flooding, hurricanes and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g., drought, desertification, and/or poor water quality).\nIncreased worldwide focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. New or more stringent laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change related concerns have affected and will likely continue to affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Some of our facilities are, for example, engaged in manufacturing processes that produce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, or rely on products from others that do so. We are working to identify opportunities to utilize alternatives to fossil-based energy sources, to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce our consumption of water and generation of waste, and to ensure our compliance with environmental regulations where we operate, enhancing our record of environmental sustainability. However, new and evolving laws, regulations and rule makings globally are expected to impose different and more restrictive standards, and require greater disclosures. They could also require capital investments, including to transition to low emission technologies, could adversely impact our ongoing operations, and could require changes on a more accelerated time frame. In the U.S., both the SEC and DoD are actively engaged in climate-related rule-makings. Our suppliers are expected to face similar challenges and incur additional compliance costs that may be passed on to us. These direct and indirect costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. And non-compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements could also negatively impact our reputation and ability to do business.\nIn 2022, the SEC and FAR council issued proposed rule-makings on climate change. The new proposed rules, depending on how they are finally adopted, as well as other changes the government might implement, could impose significant new burdens on the company and our suppliers, with significant costs and operational impacts, and adversely impact our ability to win business and operate successfully.\nChanges in our customers’ requirements, priorities, and ways of doing business are also likely to have an impact on our business, operations, and financial success. These changes create opportunities and risks. If, for example, our customers develop requirements and adopt policies that place further emphasis on social and environmental objectives, and we are unable to meet those evolving demands, we will be less successful in selling our products, winning new business, and growing our revenues.\nThe company is building on its strong environmental record, with a particular focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations, and has set a goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2035. The company is committed to working to achieve its climate change related objectives. However, the costs of doing so may be greater than expected, and there can be no assurance the company will achieve its objectives, or meet the evolving sustainability expectations and standards of our investors and other external stakeholders. Any failure to achieve our goals, a perception that we are not responsible stewards, or failure effectively to respond to new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial position.\nThe company also has a strong record and is deeply committed to maintaining robust social and governance practices consistent with our values. As with environmental sustainability matters, shareholders and other stakeholders are increasingly interested in these social and governance practices, including, for example, with respect to values, risk management oversight, responsible business practices, and diversity, equity and inclusion.\nShareholders and others have increasingly looked to a company’s ESG practices, disclosures and performance when making investment or other financial decisions. Customers, regulators and oversight agencies have been increasing requirements and enforcement activities. And employees increasingly look to ESG practices in considering where to work. We believe our ESG practices, disclosures and performance are strong and growing. However, if they do not meet the evolving expectations of our stakeholders, we can expect to experience adverse impacts on our reputation and our ability to win programs, to employ and retain talent, to remain in compliance, and to continue to enjoy\n-19-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\naccess to capital. A failure to meet expectations may materially negatively affect our results of operations, ability to manage our liquidity, or implement our strategies.\nThe effects and costs of environmental, social and governance concerns or any failure to meet related requirements or expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nOur international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations.\nSales to customers outside the U.S. are an important component of our strategy. Our international business (including our participation in joint ventures, requirements for local content, and our global supply chain) is subject to numerous political and economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally. These risks differ in some respects from those associated with our U.S. business and our exposure to such risks is expected to increase if and as our international business continues to grow.\nOur international business is generally subject to both U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and practices, including, without limitation, ones relating to export/import controls, sanctions, technology transfers, government contracts and procurement, local participation, data privacy and protection, exchange rates and controls, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, anti-boycott provisions, securities laws, labor and employment, works councils and other labor groups, taxes, environment, security restrictions and intellectual property. Failure by us, our employees, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges. Failure to comply with local practices can adversely impact our ability to win and perform business. Our customers outside of the U.S. also often have the ability to terminate contracts for convenience as well as for default based on performance. Suspension or debarment, or termination of a contract due to default could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nNew regulations and requirements, or changes to existing ones in countries in which we operate can significantly increase our costs and risks of doing business internationally. Despite robust processes, we also face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products and resources.\nChanges in laws, political leadership and environment, and/or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to conduct profitable business in international markets. Our international business is impacted by changes in U.S. and non-U.S. national policies and priorities, and geopolitical relationships, any of which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment, political leadership, geopolitical and economic uncertainties, world events, government budgets, inflationary pressures and economic and political factors more generally. The U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, emerging nuclear tensions, and diverse regional security concerns. Any of these factors may impact demand for our products and services, funding for programs, our ability to perform, our supply chain, export authorizations, purchasing decisions or customer payments. Global macroeconomic conditions, as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit are also likely to further impact our business.\nOur contracts with non-U.S. customers in some cases include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks. They may include requirements to hire, invest, manufacture or purchase locally, or specific financial obligations, including offset obligations, and they may provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. They may also require us to enter into letters of credit, performance bonds, bank guarantees or other financial arrangements. If we are dependent on in-country suppliers, we face risks related to their failure to perform in accordance with legal requirements, particularly where we rely on a sole source supplier. Our ability to sell products globally could be adversely affected if we are unable to design our products on a cost effective basis or to obtain and retain all necessary export authorizations, which the U.S. government can deny, change or revoke. Our business outside of the U.S. also depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel with the skills and/or security clearances in the markets in which we do business. We may need to partner successfully with non-U.S. companies, including through joint ventures, teaming agreements, co-production or other arrangements. This risk includes the ability to identify and negotiate appropriate arrangements with qualified and acceptable local partners, potential exposure for their actions, and the ability effectively to terminate these arrangements. This risk is complicated further when we partner with government-affiliated entities.\n-20-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe products and services we provide, including those provided by suppliers and joint ventures, are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, economic or fiscal challenges, military or political conflicts, different business practices and/or developing legal systems. This may increase the risk to our employees, suppliers or other third parties, including for their safety, and increase our risk to a wide range of financial consequences and other liabilities, as well as loss of property or damage to our products.\nThe occurrence and impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nMany of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, require state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet our contractual obligations could adversely affect our profitability, reputation and future prospects.\nWe design, develop and manufacture technologically advanced and innovative products and services, which are applied by our customers in a variety of environments, including highly demanding operating conditions, to accomplish challenging missions. Problems and delays in the successful development and delivery of our solutions, including as a result of issues with our design, technology or operations, digital transformation, inability to achieve learning curve assumptions, artificial intelligence, manufacturing materials or components, or subcontractor (or other supplier) performance can prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk and liabilities. Similarly, failures to perform on schedule or otherwise to fulfill our contractual obligations can negatively impact our financial position, reputation and ability to win future business.\nIn addition, our products cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that can negatively affect revenue, schedule and profitability, and result in loss of life or property. They include loss on launch or flight of spacecraft, loss of aviation platforms, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, unintended explosions, problems with design, quality and workmanship, country of origin of procured materials, inadequate supplier components and degradation of product performance. Factors that may affect revenue and profitability also include: inaccurate cost estimates, design issues, human factors, unforeseen costs and expenses, diversion of management focus, loss of follow-on work, replacement obligations, and repayment to the government customer of certain contract cost and fee payments previously received.\nCertain contracts, primarily involving space satellite systems, contain provisions that entitle the customer to recover fees in the event of failure of the system upon launch or subsequent deployment for less than a specified period of time. Under such terms, we are generally required to forfeit fees previously recognized and/or collected.\nIf we are unable to meet our obligations, including due to issues regarding the design, development or manufacture of our products or services, or we experience launch, platform or satellite system failures, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nOur business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nWe have significant operations, including centers of excellence, located in regions that have been, and may in the future be, exposed to hurricanes, earthquakes, water levels, wildfires, windstorms, and other natural disasters. For example, in recent years, our facilities in Lake Charles, LA, and Melbourne, FL, were damaged by hurricanes, which temporarily interrupted site operations and had significant adverse impacts on our employees, their families and the local communities, as well as our costs and performance. We expect our facilities, operations, employees and communities in the future, particularly at facilities in coastal areas and areas prone to extreme weather events and water scarcity to continue to be at risk for future natural disasters or other weather events (which may be exacerbated by climate change). Our subcontractors and other suppliers have also been, and may in the future be, subject to natural disasters that could cause disruption and affect their ability to deliver or perform. Disruptions also impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, or result in a lack of available coverage. Although we take steps to mitigate these risks, including considering them in determining where to put new businesses, the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters, which may increase, as well as delays in recovery, may be significant.\nIf insurance or other sources are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n-21-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n▪\nWe provide products and services, including related to hazardous and high risk operations, which subjects us to various environmental, regulatory, financial, reputational and other risks.\nWe provide products and services related to hazardous and high risk operations. Among other such operations, our products and services are used in nuclear-related activities (including nuclear-powered platforms) and used in support of nuclear-related operations of third parties. In addition, certain of our products are provided with space and missile launches. We use and provide energetic materials, including in propulsion systems, which include products that involve highly explosive or flammable elements. We develop missile systems, and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, as well as subsystems and components. These and other activities subject us to various extraordinary risks, including (1) potential liabilities relating to nuclear or non-nuclear launch-related incidents, unintended initiation of energetic materials and explosions, including risk of personal injury, property damage and environmental harm; (2) harmful effects on the environment and human health that may result from nuclear-related activities, operations or incidents; the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; and the development, testing and use of energetics, including in propulsion systems, and unintended explosions or releases and (3) to failed launches. We may be subject to reputational harm and potential liabilities arising out of such incidents or hazardous operations, whether or not the cause was within our control, and insurance may not be reasonably available. Under some circumstances, the U.S. government and prime contractors may provide for certain indemnification and other protection, including pursuant to, or in connection with, Public Law 85-804, 10 U.S.C. 2354, the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, the NASA Space Act, the Commercial Space Launch Act and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act, for certain risks, but those protections may not be available or adequate.\nCertain of our products, such as medium and large caliber ammunition and propulsion systems, involve the use, manufacture and/or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials. These activities have resulted and may result in incidents that cause workplace injuries and fatalities, the temporary shut down or other disruption of manufacturing, production delays, environmental harm and expense, fines and liabilities to third parties. We have safety and loss prevention programs, which provide for pre-construction reviews, along with safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to attempt to mitigate some such incidents, as well as potentially insurance coverage and indemnification, but they may not be successful.\nIn addition, our customers may use or misuse our products and services in ways that can be unusually hazardous or risky, or in ways that are not intended, which may create potential liabilities for our company, as well as reputational harm.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize (e.g. if there was a nuclear incident, or an incident related to launch activities or the use of energetics or propulsion systems), and if insurance coverage or indemnification or other protection was not fully available, it could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nWe may be unable fully to exploit or adequately to protect intellectual property rights, which could materially affect our ability to compete, our reputation and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nTo perform on our contracts and to win new business, we depend on our ability to develop, protect and exploit our intellectual property and also to access the intellectual property of others under reasonable terms. Increasing demands from our customers to access and obtain rights in our intellectual property, and positions taken by our suppliers and competitors challenge our ability to exploit, protect and access intellectual property.\nWe own many forms of intellectual property, including U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets and we license or otherwise obtain access to various intellectual property rights of third parties. The U.S. government and certain foreign governments hold licenses or other rights to certain intellectual property that we develop in performance of government contracts, and at times seek to use or authorize others to use such intellectual property, including in competition with us and including where we do not believe they are entitled to do so. Governments continue to increase efforts to assert or obtain more extensive rights in intellectual property, which could reduce our ability to develop, protect and exploit certain of our intellectual property rights and to compete. Governments also decline at times to make intellectual property of others available to us under acceptable terms.\nWe rely significantly upon proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. We typically seek to protect this information, including by entering into intellectual property agreements with our employees and other parties such as consultants, teammates and subcontractors. These agreements and other measures may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information. In the event of an infringement of such intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement, a misuse or theft of our intellectual property or\n-22-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ndivulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies. In addition, our trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nIn some instances, our ability to win or perform contracts requires us to use third party intellectual property. This may require the government or our customer to provide rights to such third party intellectual property, or that we are able to negotiate directly with third parties to obtain necessary rights on reasonable terms. That may not be practicable.\nOur intellectual property is subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. Our access to and use of intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties is also subject to challenges. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management’s attention. Moreover, the laws concerning intellectual property rights vary among countries and the protection provided to our intellectual property by foreign laws and courts may not be favorable.\nIf we are unable adequately to exploit our intellectual property rights, to protect our intellectual property rights, to obtain rights to intellectual property of others, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, ability to compete for and perform on contracts, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and new technologies, progress and benefit from digital transformation and maintain technologies, facilities and equipment to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers.\nMany of the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers evolve regularly. Our success depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced, innovative and cost-effective products and services and market these products and services to our customers globally. Our ability to develop innovative and technologically advanced products depends on the talent of our workforce, continued funding for, and investment in, research and development projects, continued access to assured suppliers of important technologies and components and our ability to provide the people, technologies, facilities, equipment and financial capacity needed to develop and deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency.\nTo perform on our contracts and to win new business, we also depend increasingly on our ability to progress successfully on our digital transformation.\nIt is increasingly necessary to meet evolving customer requirements, to differentiate our offerings, and to achieve efficiencies that we and our suppliers/partners successfully develop digital based solutions and transform our operations. While we are committing significant resources to these efforts, and are making good progress, our company and our suppliers/partners face various substantial challenges and we may not be fully successful with digital transformation.\nOur customers increasingly require us to be agile and efficient, digitally enabled and able to harness integrated digital technologies and capabilities to deliver solutions with agility and affordability. If we are unable to continue to develop new products and technologies in a timely fashion, and progress successfully to effect digital solutions and transformation, or if we fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to maintain our competitive position, we could lose a significant amount of future business to our competitors, which also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate favorable financial results and maintain market share and on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nGeneral and Other Risk Factors\n▪\nOur insurance coverage, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be unavailable or inadequate to cover all of our significant risks, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position.\nWe endeavor to obtain insurance from financially solid, responsible, highly rated counterparties in established markets to cover significant risks and liabilities (including, for example, natural disasters, space launches and on-orbit operations, cyber security, hazardous operations, energetics and products liability). Not every risk or liability can be insured, and insurance coverage is not always reasonably available. The policy limits and terms of coverage reasonably obtainable may not be sufficient to cover actual losses or liabilities. Even if insurance coverage is available, we are not always able to obtain it at a price or on terms acceptable to us or without increasing exclusions. Disputes with insurance carriers over the availability of coverage, and the insolvency of one or more of our insurers has affected and may continue to affect the availability or timing of recovery, as well as our ability to obtain\n-23-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ninsurance coverage at reasonable rates in the future. In some circumstances we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions, laws or otherwise. However, these protections are not always available, are difficult to negotiate and obtain, are typically subject to certain terms or limitations, including the availability of funds, and may not be sufficient to cover our losses or liabilities. If insurance coverage, customer indemnifications and/or other legal protections are not available or are not sufficient to cover risks or losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nPension and other postretirement benefit (OPB) obligations and related expenses and funding requirements may fluctuate significantly depending upon investment performance of plan assets, changes in actuarial assumptions, and legislative or other regulatory actions.\nThe company’s pension and OPB obligations and related expenses are dependent upon the investment performance of plan assets and various assumptions, including discount rates, mortality and the estimated long-term rates of return on plan assets. Changes in assumptions associated with our pension and OPB plans, investment performance of plan assets, and gains or losses associated with changes in valuation of marketable securities related to our non-qualified plans and other non-operating assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nFunding requirements for our pension plans, including Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, are subject to legislative and other government regulatory actions. In accordance with government regulations, pension plan cost recoveries under our U.S. government contracts may occur in different periods from when they are recognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made. These timing differences, as well as government challenges to pension and OPB cost recovery, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n▪\nBusiness investments and/or recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets may become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nGoodwill accounts for approximately 40 percent of our total assets as of December 31, 2022. Although we currently have excess fair value of our reporting units over their respective carrying values, changes in business conditions or in the market-based inputs used in our goodwill impairment test, could result in significant write-offs of goodwill or other long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations."

    "text": "OVERVIEW\nThe following discussion should be read along with the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as Part II, “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (“2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K”).\nGlobal Security Environment\nThe U.S. and its allies continue to face a global security environment of heightened tensions and instability, threats from state and non-state actors, including in particular major global powers, as well as terrorist organizations, increasing nuclear tensions, diverse regional security concerns and political instability. The market for defense products, services and solutions globally is driven by these complex and evolving security challenges, considered in the broader context of political and socioeconomic circumstances and priorities. Our operations and financial performance, as well as demand for our products and services, are impacted by global events, including violence and unrest. The same is true for our suppliers and other business partners.\nThe conflict in Ukraine has increased global tensions and instability, highlighted threats and increased global demand, as well as further disrupted global supply chains and added costs. We have experienced a modest increase in demand for certain of our goods and services directly and indirectly related to the conflict in the Ukraine. We also have experienced a slight disruption to some of our programs and supply chain, including unanticipated cost growth, as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and economic sanctions. However, we do not have sizable business dealings in Russia or Ukraine, and do not anticipate significant adverse impacts from the ongoing conflict.\nMore broadly, the conflict in Ukraine and threats elsewhere have heightened tensions and highlighted security requirements globally, especially in Europe and the Pacific region, as well as the U.S. We have started to see, and expect to continue to see, increased demand for defense products and services from allies and partner nations, particularly in those areas. We are actively exploring both opportunities and risks.\nFor further information on the global security environment, including the risks related thereto, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks” and “Risk Factors.”\nGlobal Health and Economic Environment\nCOVID-19\nSince at least March 2020, when it was first characterized as a global pandemic, COVID-19 has dramatically impacted and continues to impact the global health and economic environments, including millions of confirmed cases and deaths, business slowdowns or shutdowns, labor shortfalls, supply chain challenges, regulatory challenges, inflationary pressures and market volatility. We discussed in some detail in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, and subsequent SEC filings, the pandemic, its impacts and risks, and actions taken up to the time of each filing. In this Form 10-K, we provide a further update.\nIn 2022, the pandemic continued to have significant adverse impacts on the global health and macroeconomic environments, particularly with the spread of new variants and other viruses and illnesses, ongoing disruption of the labor force and supply chains, continued inflation, and market volatility and uncertainties. We expect such adverse impacts to continue. However, with extraordinary efforts by our employees, our governments and customers, our partners and our company, direct COVID-19-related impacts on our business generally declined in 2022. While we cannot predict the future course of the pandemic or its consequences, we are not currently assuming significant additional direct COVID-19 related impacts on our business.\nThe company continues to work to monitor and address the pandemic, including its impact on our company, our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our communities. Our goals have been, and continue to be, to keep our employees safe, to lessen the potential adverse impacts, both health and economic, and to continue to position the company for long-term success. Like the communities in which we operate, our actions have varied, and will continue to vary, depending on the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses, applicable government requirements, and the needs of our stakeholders.\nGlobal Economic Environment\nIn part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economic environment has experienced, and continues to experience, extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation and inflationary pressures; widespread delays and disruptions in supply chains; workforce challenges, including labor shortages (especially in critical skill areas); and market volatility. These macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, delays and other performance challenges, as well as increased competing demands for limited\n-30-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nresources to address such increased costs and other challenges, for our company, our suppliers and partners, and our customers. For example, as discussed in greater detail in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, our latest estimated cost to complete the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase of the B-21 program reflects updated estimates for adverse impacts from these macroeconomic factors, as well as potential opportunities to address them.\nWe continue to work hard to mitigate some of the challenges caused by the current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by taking steps to support our suppliers and small businesses and enhancing our workforce through extensive hiring, development and retention efforts. However, the broader macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, continued adversely to affect the company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2022. We cannot clearly predict how long these macroeconomic challenges will continue, or how they will change over time, or what additional resources will be available, but we expect to see this challenging macroeconomic environment continue adversely to impact the global economy, our customers, our industry and our company in 2023.\nIn addition, increased interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing for governments, could further impact government spending priorities (in the U.S. and allied countries, in particular), including their demand for defense products. Economic tensions and changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements, could also further impact the global market for defense products, services and solutions.\nU.S. Political, Budget and Regulatory Environment\nOn March 15, 2022, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY 2022, which provided full-year funding for federal agencies, including $782 billion for national defense. This represented an approximately $42 billion or 6 percent increase above the budget for FY 2021, approximately $30 billion more than the Administration had initially requested. The Pentagon’s portion of the overall national defense budget for FY 2022 was $743 billion.\nOn March 28, 2022, the President proposed his budget for FY 2023, which included $813 billion for national defense programs, approximately $31 billion or 4 percent higher than what was appropriated in FY 2022. The Pentagon’s portion of the overall requested national defense budget was $773 billion.\nOn December 23, 2022, the President signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2023, which supports approximately $858 billion in FY 2023 funding for national defense, $817 billion of which is for the DoD. In addition, the FY 2023 NDAA grants DoD discretionary authority under limited circumstances to provide extraordinary relief to contractors to address certain inflationary impacts. Although discussions have occurred, DoD has not yet issued written guidance for how it intends to exercise this authority.\nOn December 29, 2022, the President signed an Omnibus appropriations act for FY 2023 that provided $858 billion for national defense programs, approximately $45 billion more than the Administration initially requested for FY 2023 and approximately $76 billion or 10 percent higher than what was appropriated in FY 2022. The Pentagon’s portion of the overall national defense budget for FY 2023 is $817 billion. It includes up to $1 billion for extraordinary relief in FY 2023.\nIn addition to the U.S. national security spending detailed above, the U.S. has pledged over $100 billion in security assistance to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine across FY 2022 and FY 2023, including approximately $50 billion in DoD spending. Assistance includes transfers of weapons systems from U.S. inventories, orders for production of additional weapons systems, both to backfill U.S. stockpiles and for Ukraine directly, and assistance from U.S. capabilities.\nIt is difficult to predict the specific course of future defense budgets. Current and future requirements related to the conflict in Ukraine, threats in the Pacific regions and other security priorities, as well as global inflation, the national debt, the costs of the pandemic and other domestic priorities, among other things, in the U.S. and globally, will continue to impact our customers’ budgets and priorities, and our industry. Current tensions within Congress and the wider U.S. political environment may also impact defense budgets and government spending more broadly.\nWe believe the current global security environment highlights the significant national security threats to our nation and our allies, and the need for strong deterrence and a robust defense capability. We believe that our capabilities, particularly in space, C4ISR, missile defense, battle management, advanced weapons, survivable aircraft and mission systems should help our customers in the U.S. and globally defend against current and future threats and, as a result, continue to allow for long-term profitable business growth.\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 suspended the debt ceiling through July 31, 2021. In October 2021, the statutory debt limit was increased by $480 billion and, in December 2021, it was further increased by $2.5 trillion, which is\n-31-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ncurrently expected to allow the Treasury Department to finance the government into 2023. In January 2023, the debt ceiling was reached and the Treasury Department began taking “extraordinary measures” to finance the government and avoid a breach of the debt ceiling. We expect statutory action will be needed in 2023 to increase or suspend the debt ceiling.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act of 2022, which includes an advanced manufacturing investment tax credit, among other provisions, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes implementation of a new alternative minimum tax and a one percent excise tax on share repurchases, among other provisions, were signed into law. We expect the excise tax on share repurchases to impact us beginning in 2023; however, we do not expect this tax or any other provision of this legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.\nMore broadly, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, an accelerated pace of new rulemakings, new and expanded uses of existing authorities, changing legal rulings and landscapes, and aggressive enforcement actions. These changes and the accelerated pace of change, not only impose additional obligations and risk, but also create further uncertainty regarding our operating environment.\nThe political environment, federal budget, debt ceiling and regulatory environment are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable debate, especially in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the inflationary environment and political tensions. The results of those debates could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and the company’s programs in particular. We anticipate that the broader macroeconomic environment, with ongoing inflationary pressures, labor challenges, and supply chain disruption, among other considerations, will continue to play a significant role in the outcome of these debates and, in turn, on our industry and company.\nFor further information on the risks we face from the current political and economic environment, see “Risk Factors.”\nDisposition of IT and Mission Support Services Business\nEffective January 30, 2021 (the “Divestiture date”), we completed the sale of our IT and mission support services business (the “IT services divestiture”) for $3.4 billion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion. The IT and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former IS&S division of Defense Systems (excluding the Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former CIMS division of Mission Systems; and the former Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. Operating results include sales and operating income for the IT and mission support services business prior to the Divestiture date; therefore, no sales and operating income were recognized for this business during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe company recorded pre-tax profit of the IT and mission support services business of $20 million and $247 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOperating Performance Assessment and Reporting\nWe manage and assess our business based on our performance on contracts and programs (typically larger contracts or two or more closely-related contracts). We recognize sales from our portfolio of long-term contracts as control is transferred to the customer, primarily over time on a cost-to-cost basis (cost incurred relative to costs estimated at completion). As a result, sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs incurred across our large portfolio of contracts. Due to the applicable FAR and CAS requirements that govern our U.S. government business, most types of costs are allocable to U.S. government contracts. As such, we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as manufacturing, engineering and design labor, subcontractor, material, overhead and general and administrative (G&A) costs), as much as we do on total contract cost, which is the key driver of our sales and operating income.\nIn evaluating our operating performance, we primarily focus on changes in sales and operating margin rates. Where applicable, significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs, or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts, are described in our analysis. Based on this approach and the nature of our operations, the discussion of results of operations below first focuses on our four segments before distinguishing between products and services. Changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume, while changes in operating margin rates are generally described in terms of performance and/or contract mix. For purposes of this discussion, volume generally refers to increases or decreases in sales or cost from production/service activity levels and performance generally refers to non-volume-related changes in profitability, which are typically described in terms of changes in net EAC adjustments. Contract mix generally refers to changes in the ratio of contract type and/or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production, and/or sustainment).\n-32-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS\nFor purposes of the operating results discussion below, we assess our performance using certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” or “FAS”). Organic sales is defined as total sales excluding sales attributable to the company's IT services divestiture. This measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure in evaluating the company’s underlying sales growth as well as in providing an understanding of our ongoing business and future sales trends by presenting the company’s sales before the impact of divestiture activity.\nTransaction-adjusted net earnings and transaction-adjusted earnings per share (transaction-adjusted EPS) exclude impacts related to the IT services divestiture, including the gain on sale of the business, associated federal and state income tax expenses, transaction costs, and the make-whole premium for early debt redemption. They also exclude the impact of mark-to-market pension and OPB (“MTM”) benefit/(expense) and related tax impacts, which are generally only recognized during the fourth quarter. These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the company’s underlying financial performance by presenting the company’s operating results before the non-operational impact of divestiture activity and pension and OPB actuarial gains and losses. These measures are also consistent with how management views the underlying performance of the business as the impact of the IT services divestiture and MTM accounting are not considered in management’s assessment of the company’s operating performance or in its determination of incentive compensation awards.\nWe reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. These non-GAAP measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSelected financial highlights are presented in the table below:\n-33-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nSales\nThe tables below reconcile sales to organic sales:\n2022 sales increased $935 million and 2022 organic sales increased $1.1 billion, or 3 percent,\ndue to higher sales at Space Systems and Mission Systems, partially offset by lower sales at Aeronautics Systems and Defense Systems. 2022 sales reflect strong demand, the timing of material receipts and improving trends in labor availability during the second half of the year.\nSee “Segment Operating Results” below for further information by segment and “Product and Service Analysis” for product and service detail. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments.\nOperating Income and Margin Rate\n2022 operating income decreased $2.1 billion, or 36 percent, primarily due to a $2.0 billion pre-tax gain on sale and $192 million of unallocated corporate expenses recognized in the prior year associated with the IT services divestiture. Operating income also decreased due to a $330 million reduction in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, which more than offset higher segment operating income and lower non-divestiture-related unallocated corporate expense. 2022 operating margin rate declined to 9.8 percent from 15.8 percent reflecting the items above.\n2022 G&A costs as a percentage of sales increased to 10.6 percent from 10.1 percent, primarily due to an increase in investments for future business opportunities.\nFor further information regarding product and service operating costs and expenses, see “Product and Service Analysis” below.\n-34-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nMark-to-Market Pension and OPB Benefit/Expense\nThe primary components of pre-tax MTM benefit (expense) are presented in the table below:\n2022 MTM benefit (expense) of $1.2 billion was primarily driven by a 256 basis point increase in the discount rate from year end 2021, partially offset by losses of 15.4 percent on plan assets compared to our 7.5 percent asset return assumption.\nFederal and Foreign Income Taxes\nThe 2022 effective tax rate (ETR) decreased to 16.1 percent from 21.6 percent primarily due to an $86 million benefit resulting from the resolution of the IRS examination of certain legacy OATK tax returns, as well as additional federal income taxes in the prior year resulting from the IT services divestiture. The company’s 2022 MTM benefit increased the 2022 ETR by 1.2 percentage points; however, the 2021 MTM benefit did not significantly impact the 2021 ETR. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNet Earnings\nThe table below reconciles net earnings to transaction-adjusted net earnings:\n(1)\nThe deferred state tax impact in each period was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent and is included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income.\n(2)\nThe federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from MTM benefit (expense) and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate.\n(3)\nThe state tax impact includes $62 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n(4)\nThe federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes $250 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n2022 net earnings decreased $2.1 billion, or 30 percent, principally due to a $1.1 billion decrease associated with the IT services divestiture, net of tax, and an $840 million decrease in our MTM benefit (expense), net of tax. Transaction-adjusted net earnings decreased $149 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to a $330 million reduction in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and $97 million of lower returns on marketable securities, partially offset by lower income tax and interest expense and higher segment operating income.\n-35-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nThe table below reconciles diluted earnings per share to transaction-adjusted EPS:\n(1)\nThe deferred state tax impact in each period was calculated using the company’s blended state tax rate of 5.25 percent and is included in Unallocated corporate expense within operating income.\n(2)\nThe federal tax impact in each period was calculated by subtracting the deferred state tax impact from MTM benefit (expense) and applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate.\n(3)\nThe state tax impact includes $62 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n(4)\nThe federal tax impact was calculated by applying the 21 percent federal statutory rate to the adjustment items and also includes $250 million of incremental tax expense related to $1.2 billion of nondeductible goodwill in the divested business.\n2022 diluted earnings per share decreased $12.07, or 28 percent, principally due to a $6.96 decrease associated with the IT services divestiture, net of tax, and a $5.02 decrease in our 2022 MTM benefit, net of tax. Transaction-adjusted EPS was comparable with the prior year and reflects a 4 percent reduction in transaction-adjusted net earnings and a 3 percent decrease in weighted-average diluted shares outstanding.\nSEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe company is aligned in four operating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems. For a more complete description of each segment’s products and services, see “Business.”\nWe present our sectors in the following business areas, which are reported in a manner reflecting core capabilities:\nThis section discusses segment sales, operating income and operating margin rate. A reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is provided below.\n-36-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nSegment Operating Income and Margin Rate\nSegment operating income, as reconciled in the table below, and segment operating margin rate (segment operating income divided by sales) are non-GAAP measures that reflect the combined operating income of our four segments less the operating income associated with intersegment sales. Segment operating income includes pension expense allocated to our sectors under FAR and CAS and excludes FAS pension service expense and unallocated corporate items (certain corporate-level expenses, which are not considered allowable or allocable under applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance). These non-GAAP measures may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as supplemental measures in evaluating the financial performance and operational trends of our sectors. These measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n(1)\nRepresents the deferred state tax benefit associated with MTM benefit (expense), which is recorded in Unallocated corporate expense consistent with other changes in deferred state taxes.\nSegment Operating Income and Margin Rate\n2022 segment operating income increased $36 million, or 1 percent, due to\nhigher operating income at Mission Systems, Space Systems and Aeronautics Systems, partially offset by lower operating income at Defense Systems due, in part, to the impact of the IT services divestiture.\n2021 segment operating income included $20 million from the IT services business, as well as a\nbenefit of approximately $100 million due to the impact of lower overhead rates on the company’s fixed price contracts.\nSegment operating margin rate decreased to 11.6 percent from 11.8 percent principally due to lower net EAC adjustments due, in part, to macroeconomic impacts, including inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges.\nFAS/CAS Operating Adjustment\nThe decrease in our 2022 FAS/CAS operating adjustment is due to lower CAS pension expense resulting from favorable plan asset returns in 2021 and changes in certain CAS actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2021.\nUnallocated Corporate Expense (Income)\nThe change in 2022 unallocated corporate expense (income) is primarily due to the prior year $2.0 billion pre-tax gain on sale and $192 million of unallowable state taxes and transaction costs associated with the IT services divestiture.\n-37-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nNet Estimate-At-Completion (EAC) Adjustments -\nWe record changes in estimated contract earnings at completion (net EAC adjustments) using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. Net EAC adjustments can have a significant effect on reported sales and operating income and the aggregate amounts are presented in the table below:\nNet EAC adjustments by segment are presented in the table below:\nFor purposes of the discussion in the remainder of this Segment Operating Results section, references to operating income and operating margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate, respectively.\nAERONAUTICS SYSTEMS\nSales\n2022 sales decreased $728 million, or 6 percent, due to lower volume in both Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems, including restricted programs, a $180 million decrease on the Global Hawk program, a $159 million decrease on the E-2 program and a $119 million decrease on the JSTARS program as it nears completion.\nOperating Income\n2022 operating income increased $23 million, or 2 percent, due to a higher operating margin rate, partially offset by lower sales. 2022 operating margin rate increased to 10.6 percent from 9.7 percent primarily due to higher net favorable EAC adjustments and a $38 million gain on a property sale. Higher net favorable EAC adjustments reflect $133 million of positive adjustments on the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the B-21 program, partially offset by lower net EAC adjustments associated with other restricted work, as well as $135 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments on F-35 in the prior year. The prior year operating margin rate also reflects a $21 million benefit associated with favorable overhead rate performance.\n-38-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDEFENSE SYSTEMS\nSales\n2022 sales decreased $197 million, or 3 percent, due, in part, to a $106 million reduction in sales related to the IT services divestiture. 2022 organic sales decreased $91 million, or 2 percent, principally due to a $154 million decrease from lower scope on an international training program, completion of a Joint Services support program and wind-down of the UKAWACS and JSTARS programs, partially offset by a $144 million increase from ramp-up on the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) program, as well as higher volume on the Special Ammunition and Weapon Systems (SAWS) and NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance In-Service Support (NATO AGS ISS) programs.\nOperating Income\n2022 operating income decreased $32 million, or 5 percent, due, in part, to a $14 million reduction in operating income related to the IT services divestiture, as well as lower sales. Operating margin rate was comparable with the prior year.\nMISSION SYSTEMS\nSales\n2022 sales increased $262 million, or 3 percent, and includes a $42 million reduction in sales related to the IT services divestiture. 2022 organic sales increased $304 million, or 3 percent, primarily due to higher restricted sales in the Networked Information Solutions business area, $107 million of higher volume on airborne radar programs and a $107 million increase on the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP). These increases were partially offset by a $231 million decrease on Navigation, Targeting and Survivability programs and a $118 million decrease on the Joint Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (JCREW) program.\nOperating Income\n2022 operating income increased $39 million, or 2 percent, due to higher sales. Operating margin rate was comparable with the prior year and reflects a $33 million benefit recognized in connection with a contract-related legal matter, partially offset by the previously described overhead rate benefit to fixed price contracts in the prior year.\n-39-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nSPACE SYSTEMS\nSales\n2022 sales and organic sales increased $1.7 billion, or 16 percent, due to higher sales in both business areas. Launch & Strategic Missiles sales increased primarily due to ramp-up on development programs, including a $454 million increase on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program and a $449 million increase on the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program, as well as higher volume on the GEM63 program in support of Amazon’s Project Kuiper. Sales in the Space business area were driven by a $320 million increase due to ramp-up on the Space Development Agency (SDA) Tranche 1 Transport and Tracking Layer programs awarded earlier this year, higher volume on restricted programs and a $134 million increase in sales on the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) program, partially offset by a $149 million decrease in sales for the James Webb Space Telescope after its successful launch in December 2021.\nOperating Income\n2022 operating income increased $37 million, or 3 percent, due to higher sales, partially offset by a lower operating margin rate. Operating margin rate decreased to 9.4 percent from 10.6 percent primarily due to lower net EAC adjustments and a $45 million write-down of commercial inventory, partially offset by a $96 million gain recognized in connection with a land exchange transaction.\n-40-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nPRODUCT AND SERVICE ANALYSIS\nThe following table presents product and service sales and operating costs and expenses by segment:\n(1)\nA reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income is included in “Segment Operating Results.”\nProduct Sales and Costs\n2022 product sales increased $654 million, or 2 percent, primarily due to an increase in product sales at Space Systems, partially offset by a decrease in product sales at Aeronautics Systems. The increase at Space Systems was driven by ramp-up on development programs including GBSD and NGI, as well as higher volume on the SDA Tranche 1 Transport Layer and Tranche 1 Tracking Layer programs. The decrease at Aeronautics Systems was principally due to lower volume on restricted programs, as well as the Global Hawk and E-2 programs.\n2022 product costs increased $600 million, or 2 percent, consistent with the higher product sales described above.\nService Sales and Costs\n2022 service sales increased $281 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to an increase in service sales at Aeronautics Systems, principally on restricted programs, partially offset by a decrease in service sales at Defense Systems. The decrease at Defense Systems was driven by lower scope on an international training program, the impact of the IT services divestiture, completion of a Joint Services support program and wind-down of the UKAWACS program. Sales from the divested IT services business, which were largely included in service sales, were $162 million in the prior year.\n2022 service costs increased $299 million, or 4 percent, consistent with the higher service sales described above.\n-41-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nBACKLOG\nBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are not included in backlog until the time the option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded. Backlog is converted into sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made.\nBacklog consisted of the following at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n2022 net awards totaled $39.3 billion. Significant 2022 new awards include $10.6 billion for restricted programs (principally at Aeronautics Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems), $5.3 billion for F-35, $2.1 billion for GEM63 solid rocket boosters, largely related to Amazon's Project Kuiper, $1.5 billion for the SDA Tranche 1 Transport and Tracking Layer programs, $1.3 billion for Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) missions and $1.3 billion for Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the company’s material cash requirements, including working capital needs, satisfaction of contractual commitments, funding of our pension and OPB plans, investment in our business through capital expenditures, and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.6 billion; $316 million was held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries. We expect cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities, supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities, commercial paper and/or in the capital markets through our shelf registration with the SEC, if needed, to be sufficient to provide liquidity to the company in the short-term and long-term. The company has a five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, and in April 2022, we renewed our one-year $500 million uncommitted credit facility. At December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.\nThe company’s principal contractual commitments include purchase obligations, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, and payments under operating leases. At December 31, 2022, we had $19.0 billion of purchase obligations, approximately half of which is short-term. Purchase obligations are largely comprised of open purchase order commitments to suppliers and subcontractors under U.S. government contracts. In most circumstances, our risk associated with the purchase obligations on our U.S. government contracts is limited to the termination liability provisions within those contracts. As such, we do not believe they represent a material liquidity risk to the company. At December 31, 2022, we had capital expenditure commitments of $1.5 billion, which we expect to satisfy with cash on hand. We also had provisions for uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion, some or all of which could result in future cash payments to various taxing authorities. At this time, we are unable to estimate the timing and amount of any future cash outflows related to these uncertain tax positions.\nRefer to the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase programs (Note 3), commercial paper, credit facilities and long-term debt (Note 10), standby letters of credit and guarantees (Note 12), future minimum contributions for the company’s pension and OPB plans (Note 13), and lease payment obligations (Note 15).\nCOVID-19 and the CARES Act\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) established a program with provisions to allow U.S. companies to defer the employer’s portion of social security taxes between March 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020 and pay such taxes in two installments in 2021 and 2022. Our first installment of deferred social security taxes of $200 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the second installment of $200 million was\n-42-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\npaid in the fourth quarter of 2022. Under Section 3610, the CARES Act also authorized the government to reimburse qualifying contractors for certain costs of providing paid leave to employees as a result of COVID-19. The company has sought and may continue to seek recovery for certain COVID-19-related costs under Section 3610 of the CARES Act and through our contract provisions, though it is unclear what funds will be available and how much we will be able to recover. In addition, the DoD has taken steps to increase the rate for certain progress payments from 80 percent to 90 percent for costs incurred and work performed on relevant contracts; it is unclear how long the 90 percent progress payment rate will remain in place and whether the DoD will take any further steps.\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 174\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current year and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to IRC Section 174. Our 2022 cash from operations were reduced by approximately $900 million for federal tax payments we made related to Section 174. In the future, Congress may consider legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, possibly with retroactive effect. In the meantime, we expect to continue to make additional federal tax payments based on the current Section 174 tax law. The impact of Section 174 on our cash from operations depends on the amount of research and development expenditures incurred by the company and whether the IRS issues guidance on the provision which differs from our current interpretation, among other things.\nCash Flow Measures\nIn addition to our cash position, we consider various cash flow measures in capital deployment decision-making, including cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure described in more detail below.\nOperating Cash Flow\nThe table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities:\n(1)\nIncludes depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, MTM benefit (expense), stock based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and net periodic pension and OPB income.\n2022 cash provided by operating activities decreased $666 million principally due to lower CAS pension recoveries and changes in trade working capital, including approximately $900 million of federal tax payments related to the Section 174 tax legislation described above. The prior year included $785 million of tax payments related to the IT services divestiture.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted free cash flow, as reconciled in the table below, is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by or used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer (not otherwise included in net cash provided by or used in operating activities) and the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions. Adjusted free cash flow includes proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer as such proceeds were generated in a customer sales transaction. It also includes the after-tax impact of discretionary pension contributions for consistency and comparability of financial performance. This measure may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We use adjusted free cash flow as a key factor in our planning for, and consideration of, acquisitions, the payment of dividends and stock repurchases. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.\n-43-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow:\n2022 adjusted free cash flow decreased $615 million principally due to lower net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of equipment to a customer.\nInvesting Cash Flow\n2022 net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $2.1 billion in the prior year, principally due to $3.4 billion in cash received from the sale of our IT services business during the first quarter of 2021.\nFinancing Cash Flow\n2022 net cash used in financing activities decreased $4.4 billion principally due to a $2.2 billion decrease in debt repayments and a $2.2 billion reduction in share repurchases.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nDue to the long-term nature of our contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method, which requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services.\nContract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), contract claims and requests for equitable adjustment (REAs). Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.\nOur cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals, and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate an estimated contract profit based on total estimated contract sales and cost. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, the effect of change orders, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the effect of any delays in performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.\nWe also consider the impact of macroeconomic factors on our estimates, in particular on contract EACs that span several years. For example, during 2022, we included in our EACs management’s best estimate of the impact inflation has had and may continue to have on our contracts. We also included our current best estimate of the impact on our EACs of disruptions we have experienced and continue to experience in the supply chain. The volatility of the recent macroeconomic environment has added complexity to our estimation process and may result in our year end 2022 contract EACs having more variability in the future than they might otherwise have had if the estimates had been prepared in a more stable macroeconomic environment.\n-44-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nWe generally review and reassess our sales, cost and profit estimates for each significant contract at least annually or more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events, changes in circumstances and evaluations of contract performance to reflect the latest reliable information available. The company performs on a broad portfolio of long-term contracts, including the development of complex and customized military platforms and systems, as well as advanced electronic equipment and software, that often include technology at the forefront of science. Cost estimates on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts are inherently more uncertain as to future events than on mature, full-rate production contracts. As a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates and greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth on fixed-price development contracts and early-stage/low-rate production contracts. Changes in estimates occur for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated, unanticipated performance and other risks affecting contract costs, performance issues with subcontractors or suppliers, changes in indirect cost allocations, such as overhead and G&A costs, and changes in estimated award and incentive fees. Identified risks typically include technical, schedule and/or performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort. Similarly, the changes in estimates may include changes in, or resolution of, identified opportunities for operating margin improvement.\nFor the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, see “Segment Operating Results” and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRetirement Benefits\nOverview\n– The determination of projected benefit obligations, the fair value of plan assets, and pension and OPB expense for our retirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries. As we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted, or as a result of plan amendments, future pension and OPB expense and our projected benefit obligation could increase or decrease. The principal estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations are the discount rate, cash balance crediting rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, estimated fair market value of plan assets, and the mortality rate of those covered by our pension and OPB plans. The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions (i.e., actuarial gains or losses) are recognized immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\nDiscount Rate\n– The discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle our pension and OPB obligations. The discount rate is generally based on the yield of high-quality corporate fixed-income investments. At the end of each year, we determine the discount rate using a theoretical bond portfolio model of bonds rated AA or better to match the notional cash outflows related to projected benefit payments for each of our significant benefit plans. Taking into consideration the factors noted above, our weighted-average composite pension discount rate was 5.54 percent at December 31, 2022 and 2.98 percent at December 31, 2021.\nThe effects of a hypothetical change in the discount rate may be nonlinear and asymmetrical for future years as the discount rate changes. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2022 discount rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2022 pension and OPB obligations, which would be reflected in the 2022 MTM expense (benefit), and 2023 expected pension and OPB expense:\n-45-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCash Balance Crediting Rate\n– A portion of the company’s pension obligation and resulting pension expense is based on a cash balance formula, where participants’ hypothetical account balances are accumulated over time with pay-based credits and interest. Interest is credited monthly using the current 30-Year Treasury bond rate. The interest crediting rate is part of the cash balance formula and independent of actual pension investment earnings. The cash balance crediting rate used for FAS purposes tends to move in concert with the discount rate but has an offsetting effect on pension benefit obligations and the related MTM expense (benefit). The minimum cash balance crediting rate allowed under the plan is 2.25 percent. The cash balance crediting rate assumption has been set to its current level of 3.96 percent as of December 31, 2022, declining to 3.88 percent by 2028. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the December 31, 2022 cash balance crediting rate assumption would have the following estimated effects on the 2022 pension benefit obligation, which would be reflected in the 2022 MTM expense (benefit), and 2023 expected pension expense:\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets –\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (EROA) assumption reflects the average rate of net earnings we expect on current and future benefit plan investments. EROA is a long-term assumption, which we review annually and adjust to reflect changes in our long-term view of expected market returns and/or significant changes in our plan asset investment policy. Due to the inherent uncertainty of this assumption, we consider multiple data points at the measurement date including the plan’s target asset allocation, historical asset returns and third party projection models of expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In addition to the data points themselves, we consider trends in the data points, including changes from the prior measurement date. The EROA assumptions we use for pension benefits are consistent with those used for OPB plans; however, we reduce the EROA for OPB plans to allow for the impact of tax on investment earnings, as certain Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts are taxable.\nDuring 2022, the Investment Committee of the company’s benefit plans reviewed the plans’ major asset class allocations and approved an update to increase the target fixed-income asset allocation from 30% to 40%. The current asset allocation is now approximately 35% fixed-income, 30% public equities, 30% alternatives and 5% cash. At this time, the Investment Committee is not planning any significant changes to that mix. For further information on plan asset investments, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWhile historical market returns are not necessarily predictive of future market returns, given our long history of plan performance supported by the stability in our investment mix, investment managers, and active asset management, we believe our actual historical performance is a reasonable metric to consider when developing our EROA. Our average annual rate of return from 1976 to 2022 was approximately 10.7 percent and our 20-year and 30-year rolling average rates of return were approximately 8.6 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively, each determined on an arithmetic basis and net of expenses. Our 2022 losses on plan assets, net of expenses, were approximately 15.4 percent.\nConsistent with our past practice, we obtained long-term capital market forecasting models from several third parties and, using our target asset allocation, developed an expected rate of return on plan assets from each model. We considered not only the specific returns projected by those third party models, but also changes in the models year-to-year when developing our EROA. Despite the change in our target asset allocation described above, these models show a year-over-year increase in the expected rate of return on plan assets largely due to recent increases in interest rates, which more than offset the downward pressure on our EROA caused by the change in asset mix.\nFor determining 2022 FAS expense, we assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and an expected long-term rate of return on OPB plan assets of 7.19 percent. For 2023 FAS expense, we have assumed an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.5 percent and 7.23 percent on OPB plans. Holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in our December 31, 2022 EROA assumption would have the following estimated effects on 2023 expected pension and OPB expense:\n-46-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIn addition, holding all other assumptions constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in actual versus expected return on plan assets would have the following estimated effects on our 2023 MTM expense (benefit):\nEstimated Fair Market Value of Plan Assets\n– For certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable, such as real estate, private equity, hedge funds and opportunistic investments, we develop estimates of fair value using the best information available. Estimated fair values on these plan assets are based on redemption values and net asset values (NAV), as well as valuation methodologies that include third party appraisals, comparable transactions, discounted cash flow valuation models and public market data.\nMortality Rate\n– Mortality assumptions are used to estimate life expectancies of plan participants. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC) issued updated mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale, which reflected longer life expectancies than previously projected. In October 2019, the RPEC issued an updated mortality base table (the Private Retirement Plans Mortality table for 2012 (Pri-2012)), which we adopted after reviewing our own historical mortality experience. In October 2021, the RPEC released a new projection scale (MP-2021) that included additional underlying data for 2019, which included an increase in life expectancies relative to the prior year.\nThe RPEC did not release a MP-2022 projection scale citing complexities in incorporating the substantial number of “excess deaths” in 2020 into their existing model and uncertainties about future expectations primarily related to COVID-19. As such, after considering the information released by the RPEC in October 2021 as well as the company’s recent mortality experience in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted the full MP-2021 projection scale while continuing to use the Pri-2012 White Collar table. While the amounts and structure of the PRI-2012 base mortality table with the MP-2021 projection scale continues to reflect a reasonable estimate of mortality, we supplemented the table with 50% of the Gradual Wear-Off illustration as outlined in the RPEC’s 2022 Mortality Improvement Update paper to reflect the future impacts of COVID-19. Accordingly, we updated the mortality assumptions used in calculating our pension and OPB obligations recognized at December 31, 2022, and the amounts estimated for our 2023 pension and OPB expense.\nFor further information regarding our pension and OPB plans, see “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\nLitigation, Commitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to a range of claims, disputes, enforcement actions, investigations, lawsuits, overhead cost claims, environmental matters, income tax matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management. We determine whether to record a reserve and, if so, what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us. Determinations regarding whether to record a reserve and, if so, of what amount, reflect management’s assessment regarding what is likely to occur; they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us.\nEnvironmental Matters\n– We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do or have done business. Factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability, range of reasonably estimated costs and environmental accruals include: modification of planned remedial actions; changes in the estimated time required to conduct remedial actions; discovery of more or less extensive (or different) contamination than anticipated; information regarding the potential causes and effects of contamination; results of efforts to involve other responsible parties; financial capabilities of other responsible parties; changes in laws and regulations, their interpretation or application; contractual obligations affecting remediation or responsibilities; and improvements in remediation technology. As we expect to be able to recover a portion of environmental remediation liabilities through overhead charges on government contracts, such amounts are deferred in prepaid expenses and other current assets (current portion) and other non-current assets until charged to contracts. We use judgment to evaluate the recoverability of our environmental remediation costs, assessing, among other things, U.S. government regulations, our U.S. government contract mix and past practices. Portions of the company’s environmental liabilities we do not expect to be recoverable have been expensed.\n-47-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIncome Tax Matters\n– The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, requires the use of judgment. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. The company follows a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. We exercise judgment in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support our assessment using all available information. The technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. In measuring the tax position, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations.\nFor further information on litigation, commitments and contingencies, see “Risk Factors” and Note 1, Note 7, Note 11 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nOverview\n– We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates. Adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings.\nWe recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date. The most significant purchased intangible assets recognized from our acquisitions are generally customer-related intangible assets, including customer contracts and commercial customer relationships. We determine the fair value of those customer-related intangible assets based on estimates and judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates and discount rates. In some cases, we use discounted cash flow analyses, which are based on estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions, customer budgets, existing firm and future orders, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance.\nWe record property, plant and equipment (PP&E) for capital assets used in operating our business. Depreciation expense associated with our PP&E is generally an allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements. However, depreciation expense associated with PP&E used in our commercial businesses, as well as the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of PP&E acquired through business combinations, is not allocable to government contracts and is therefore subject to greater recoverability risk than the PP&E for which depreciation expense is recovered through our U.S. government contracts.\nImpairment Testing\n– We test for impairment of goodwill annually at each of our reporting units, which comprise our operating segments. The results of our annual goodwill impairment tests as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nIn addition to performing an annual goodwill impairment test, we may perform an interim impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill in any of our reporting units may be impaired. Such indicators may include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business, significant reductions in federal government appropriations or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. During 2022, we determined there were no impairment indicators requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we compare the fair values of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows we expect the reporting units to generate in the future, consistent with our operating plans. This income valuation method requires management to project sales, operating expenses, working capital, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi-year period, as well as to determine the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions. The WACC takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer-term contracts and barriers to market entry. The terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model. We use industry multiples (including relevant control premiums) of operating earnings to\n-48-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ncorroborate the fair values of our reporting units determined under the market valuation method of the income approach.\nWe test for impairment of our long-lived assets, including PP&E and purchased intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Our assessment is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related asset group. If such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. There were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nImpairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’ fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.\n-49-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION"

    "text": "EQUITY RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk with respect to our portfolio of marketable securities with a fair value of $332 million at December 31, 2022. These securities are exposed to market volatilities, changes in price and interest rates.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on variable-rate short-term credit facilities for which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we have $12.9 billion of long-term debt, primarily consisting of fixed-rate debt, with a fair value of approximately $12.1 billion. The terms of our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally allow investors to demand payment of these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we do not have significant exposure to interest rate risk for our fixed-rate debt; however, we do have exposure to fair value risk if we repurchase or exchange long-term debt prior to maturity. Additionally, if we were to refinance our long-term debt, it may be refinanced at higher interest rates.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nIn certain circumstances, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage a portion of the exchange rate risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. At December 31, 2022, foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of $221 million were outstanding. At December 31, 2022, a 10 percent unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nINFLATION RISK\nThe global macroeconomic environment has experienced, and continues to experience, extraordinary challenges, including the highest rates of inflation in 40 years. These macroeconomic factors have contributed, and we expect will continue to contribute, to increased costs, among other concerns. We cannot predict how long these inflationary pressures will continue, or how they may change over time, but we expect to see continued impacts on the global economy, our customers, our industry and our company.\nHistorically, we generally have been able to anticipate such increases in costs when pricing our contracts, and our bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts have typically included assumptions regarding cost escalations in amounts that have been sufficient to cover most cost increases over the period of performance, including as offset by operational efficiencies.\nHowever, the company, its subcontractors and other suppliers, have experienced, and continue to experience, increased pressures from recent heightened levels of inflation and the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment, which we have not been able to fully mitigate. If inflationary pressures continue to persist, they may continue to have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n-50-"

    "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\nFalls Church, Virginia\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January 25, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit and risk committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Cost and Revenue Estimates for Development Contracts - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes substantially all revenue as control is transferred to the customer on their long-term contracts over time using the cost-to-cost method (cost incurred relative to total cost estimated at completion). Use of the cost-to-cost-method requires the Company to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and costs associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of their products or services. The Company estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated sales and total estimated costs at completion and recognizes that profit as costs are incurred. Cost\n-51-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nestimates on contracts requiring development work are inherently more uncertain as to future events than production contracts, and, as a result, there is typically more variability in those estimates. Certain of these contracts are fixed price in nature, which results in greater financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth. Alternatively, cost-type contracts may have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods or towards the end of the contract. As a result, the estimation of costs required to complete these contracts and the expected revenues that will be earned is complex and requires significant judgment.\nGiven the judgment necessary to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and costs associated with such contracts, auditing these estimates required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of the underlying programs and a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur auditing procedures related to the cost and revenue estimates for these development contracts included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the estimates of total costs and revenues on such contracts, including development costs and any related award or incentive fee estimates for the relevant performance obligations.\n•\nWe selected certain long-term contracts for testing and performed the following procedures:\n–\nEvaluated whether the recognition of revenue over time on such contracts was appropriate based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation.\n–\nTested management’s identification of distinct performance obligations by evaluating whether the underlying goods and services were highly interdependent and interrelated.\n–\nTested management’s determination of the transaction price, including any award or incentive fees, based on the consideration expected to be received in accordance with the rights and obligations established under the contracts and any contractual modifications.\n–\nEvaluated the estimates of total cost and revenue for the performance obligation by:\n▪\nConducting inquiries of relevant program teams regarding any challenges related to the program.\n▪\nComparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated to be incurred to date.\n▪\nEvaluating management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total cost and revenue by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company’s program and business management, and testing management’s process used to develop the estimates based on their work plans, engineering specifications, program labor, and supplier contracts. This includes management’s process to identify macroeconomic impacts to programs, which could include forecasted cost impacts and assumptions on the ability to recover those costs.\n▪\nComparing management’s estimates for the selected contracts to costs and revenues of similar performance obligations, when applicable.\n–\nTested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of revenue recognized during the period for the performance obligations.\nIncome Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. Uncertain tax positions reflect the Company’s expected treatment of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, which have not been reflected in measuring income tax expense or taxes payable for financial reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses, the Company does not generally recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its consolidated statements of financial position. The Company has recognized increased uncertain tax positions in recent years\n-52-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nprincipally related to state apportionment, the methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs, and the 2017 Tax Act. Until the matters are resolved, the outcome is inherently uncertain and the Company discloses a summary of changes in their uncertain tax positions within the notes to their financial statements.\nAuditing the assumptions associated with the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves especially challenging judgments given the complexity and inherent subjectivity involved in evaluating the potential outcomes of these matters.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the assumptions used in determining uncertain tax positions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls relating to the identification and completeness of, and recognition for, uncertain tax positions, including management’s controls over the underlying key assumptions and inputs used to derive the estimates.\n•\nWith the assistance of our income tax specialists, we selected specific uncertain tax positions for testing and performed the following procedures:\n–\nInquired of the Company’s tax department, financial reporting department, and other personnel directly involved in the development of the estimates.\n–\nObtained supporting documentation and evaluated how the Company supported the position, including the assumptions and estimates used for measurement, and how the taxing authorities have historically challenged the tax position, if applicable.\n–\nObtained and read opinions provided by external counsel, as applicable, regarding the tax position taken by the Company.\n–\nEvaluated whether the uncertain tax position met the “more likely than not” recognition threshold.\n–\nEvaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the methodologies and assumptions used by management when developing these estimates.\n•\nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations.\n-53-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-54-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-55-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-56-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n-57-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company. We deliver a broad range of products, services and solutions to U.S. and international customers, and principally to the U.S. Department of Defense and intelligence community. Our broad portfolio is aligned to support national security priorities and our solutions equip our customers with capabilities they need to connect, protect and advance humanity.\nThe company is a leading provider of space systems, advanced aircraft, missile defense, advanced weapons and long-range fires capabilities, mission systems, networking and communications, strategic deterrence systems, and breakthrough technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced computing and cyber. We are focused on competing and winning programs that enable continued growth, performing on our commitments and affordably delivering capability our customers need. With the investments we've made in advanced technologies, combined with our talented workforce and digital transformation capabilities, Northrop Grumman is well positioned to meet our customers' needs today and in the future.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Northrop Grumman and its subsidiaries and joint ventures or other investments for which we consolidate the financial results. Intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in equity securities and joint ventures where the company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method.\nBasis of Presentation\nEffective January 30, 2021 (the “Divestiture date”), we completed the sale of our IT and mission support services business (the “IT services divestiture”) for $\n3.4\nbillion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n2.0\nbillion. The IT and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former IS&S division of Defense Systems (excluding the Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former CIMS division of Mission Systems; and the former Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. Operating results include sales and operating income for the IT and mission support services business prior to the Divestiture date\n. See Note\n2\nfor further information regarding the divestiture.\nAccounting Estimates\nThe company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation thereof requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared using the most current and best available information; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our sales are derived from long-term contracts with the U.S. government for the development or production of goods, the provision of services, or a combination of both. The company classifies sales as product or service based on the predominant attributes of each performance obligation.\nThe company recognizes revenue for each separately identifiable performance obligation in a contract representing a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. In most cases, goods and services provided under the company’s contracts are accounted for as single performance obligations due to the complex and integrated nature of our products and services. These contracts generally require significant integration of a group of goods and/or services to deliver a combined output. In some contracts, the company provides multiple distinct goods or services to a customer, most commonly when a contract covers multiple phases of the product life cycle (e.g., development, production, sustainment, etc.). In those cases, the company accounts for the distinct contract deliverables as separate performance obligations and allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is generally estimated using cost plus a reasonable margin. Warranties are provided on certain contracts, but do not typically provide for services beyond standard assurances and are therefore not considered to be separate performance obligations. Assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are not material.\nThe company recognizes revenue as control is transferred to the customer, either over time or at a point in time. In general, our U.S. government contracts contain termination for convenience and/or other clauses that generally provide the customer rights to goods produced and/or in-process. Similarly, our non-U.S. government contracts generally contain contractual termination clauses or entitle the company to payment for work performed to date for\n-58-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ngoods and services that do not have an alternative use. For most of our contracts, control is effectively transferred during the period of performance, so we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method (cost incurred relative to total cost estimated at completion). The company believes this represents the most appropriate measurement towards satisfaction of its performance obligations. Revenue for contracts in which the control of goods produced does not transfer until delivery to the customer is recognized at a point in time (i.e., typically upon delivery).\nContracts are often modified for changes in contract specifications or requirements, which may result in scope and/or price changes. Most of the company’s contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct in the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as part of the original performance obligation through a cumulative EAC adjustment.\nContract Estimates\nUse of the cost-to-cost method requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. The company estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated sales and total estimated cost at completion and recognizes that profit as costs are incurred. Significant judgment is used to estimate total sales and cost at completion.\nContract sales may include estimates of variable consideration, including cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentive fees), contract claims and REAs. Variable consideration is included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.\nWe recognize changes in estimated contract sales or costs and the resulting changes in contract profit on a cumulative basis. Cumulative EAC adjustments represent the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods; sales and operating margins in future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since contract inception. If it is determined that a loss is expected to result on an individual performance obligation, the entire amount of the estimable future loss, including an allocation of G&A costs, is charged against income in the period the loss is identified.\nThe following table presents the effect of aggregate net EAC adjustments:\n(1)\nBased on a 21% federal statutory tax rate.\nEAC adjustments on a single performance obligation can have a significant effect on the company’s financial statements. When such adjustments occur, we generally disclose the nature, underlying conditions and financial impact of the adjustments. During the first and fourth quarters of 2022, we recorded favorable EAC adjustments of $\n67\nmillion and $\n66\nmillion, respectively, on the engineering, manufacturing and development (EMD) phase of the B-21 program at Aeronautics Systems largely related to an increase in the amount of performance incentives we expect to earn. See Note 12 for a discussion of reasonably possible losses we may incur on the low-rate initial production (LRIP) phase of B-21. During 2021, we recorded $\n135\nmillion of unfavorable EAC adjustments on the F-35 program at Aeronautics Systems due to labor-related production impacts largely driven by COVID-19. No other such adjustments were significant to the financial statements during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents the future sales we expect to recognize on firm orders received by the company and is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations at the end of each period. It comprises both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded backlog. Unexercised contract options and IDIQ contracts are not included in backlog until the time an option or IDIQ task order is exercised or awarded.\n-59-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nCompany backlog as of December 31, 2022 was $\n78.7\nbillion.\nOf our December 31, 2022 backlog, we expect to recognize approximately 40 percent as revenue over the next 12 months and 65 percent as revenue over the next 24 months, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nFor each of the company’s contracts, the timing of revenue recognition, customer billings, and cash collections results in a net contract asset or liability at the end of each reporting period. Fixed-price contracts are typically billed to the customer either using progress payments, whereby amounts are billed monthly as costs are incurred or work is completed, or performance based payments, which are based upon the achievement of specific, measurable events or accomplishments defined and valued at contract inception. Cost-type contracts are typically billed to the customer on a monthly or semi-monthly basis.\nContract assets are equivalent to and reflected as Unbilled receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position and are primarily related to long-term contracts where revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost method exceeds amounts billed to customers. Unbilled receivables are classified as current assets and include amounts that may be billed and collected beyond one year due to the long-cycle nature of many of our contracts. Accumulated contract costs in unbilled receivables include costs such as direct production costs, factory and engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and allowable G&A. Unbilled receivables also include certain estimates of variable consideration described above. These contract assets are not considered a significant financing component of the company’s contracts as the payment terms are intended to protect the customer in the event the company does not perform on its obligations under the contract.\nContract liabilities are equivalent to and reflected as Advance payments and billings in excess of costs incurred in the consolidated statements of financial position. Certain customers make advance payments prior to the company’s satisfaction of its obligations on the contract. These amounts are recorded as contract liabilities until such obligations are satisfied, either over time as costs are incurred or at a point in time when deliveries are made. Contract liabilities are not a significant financing component as they are generally utilized to pay for contract costs within a one-year period or are used to ensure the customer meets contractual requirements.\nNet contract assets are as follows:\nThe change in the balances of the company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily results from timing differences between revenue recognition and customer billings and/or payments. Net contract assets as of December 31, 2022 decreased\n4\npercent from the prior year, primarily due to decreases in net contracts assets at Aeronautics Systems and Space Systems, partially offset by an increase in net contract assets at Defense Systems.\nThe amount of revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year was $\n2.4\nbillion, $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n1.6\nbillion, respectively.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSee Note 16 for information regarding the company’s sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region for each of our segments. We believe those categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs to our U.S. government contracts. Allowable and allocable G&A costs, including independent research and development (IR&D) and bid and proposal (B&P) costs, are allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress and are included as a component of total estimated contract costs.\nResearch and Development\nCompany-sponsored research and development activities primarily include efforts related to government programs.\nCompany-sponsored IR&D expenses totaled $\n1.2\nbillion, $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020,\n-60-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nrespectively, which represented\n3.3\npercent,\n3.2\npercent and\n2.9\npercent of total sales, respectively.\nCustomer-funded research and development activities are charged directly to the related contracts.\nIncome Taxes\nProvisions for federal and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. The company recognizes federal and foreign interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Federal tax penalties are also recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nIn accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, current state and local income and franchise taxes are generally considered allowable and allocable costs to our U.S. government contracts and, consistent with industry practice, are recorded in operating costs and expenses. The company generally recognizes changes in deferred state taxes and unrecognized state tax benefits in unallocated corporate expenses.\nUncertain tax positions reflect the company’s expected treatment of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, which have not been reflected in measuring income tax expense or taxes payable for financial reporting purposes. Until these positions are sustained by the taxing authorities or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses, the company does not generally recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and reports the tax effects as a liability for uncertain tax positions in its consolidated statements of financial position.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash in banks and highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less, primarily consisting of bank time deposits and investments in institutional money market funds. Cash in bank accounts often exceeds federally insured limits.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe company measures the fair value of its financial instruments using observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions.\nThese two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.\nThe company holds a portfolio of marketable securities to partially fund non-qualified employee benefit plans. A portion of these securities are held in common/collective trust funds and are measured at fair value using NAV per share as a practical expedient.\nMarketable securities accounted for as trading are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in Other non-current assets in the consolidated statements of financial position. Changes in unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income. Investments in held-to-maturity instruments with original maturities greater than three months are recorded at amortized cost.\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in Other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, while changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income until settlement. For derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments, gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in Other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\nThe company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk related to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers denominated in foreign currencies (i.e., foreign currency forward contracts). For foreign currency forward contracts, where model-derived valuations are appropriate, the company utilizes the income approach to determine the fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risks.\n-61-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor does it use leveraged financial instruments. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered minimal and is managed through the use of multiple counterparties with high credit standards and periodic settlements of positions, as well as by entering into master netting agreements with most of our counterparties.\nInventoried Costs\nInventoried costs generally comprise costs associated with unsatisfied performance obligations on contracts accounted for using point in time revenue recognition, costs incurred in excess of existing contract requirements or funding that are probable of recovery and other accrued contract costs that are expected to be recoverable when allocated to specific contracts. Product inventory primarily consists of raw materials and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, generally using the average cost method.\nInventoried costs include direct production costs, factory and engineering overhead, production tooling costs, and allowable G&A. G&A included in Inventoried costs, net was $\n59\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Inventoried costs are classified as current assets and include amounts related to contracts having production cycles longer than one year due to the long-cycle nature of our business.\nCash Surrender Value of Life Insurance Policies\nThe company maintains whole life insurance policies on a group of executives, which are recorded at their cash surrender value as determined by the insurance carrier. The company also has split-dollar life insurance policies on former officers and executives from acquired businesses, which are recorded at the lesser of their cash surrender value or premiums paid. These policies are utilized as a partial funding source for deferred compensation and other non-qualified employee retirement plans.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying values associated with these policies were $\n367\nmillion and $\n440\nmillion, respectively, and are recorded in Other non-current assets in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. Most assets are depreciated using declining-balance methods, with the remainder using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense is generally an allowable and allocable cost in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements and recorded in the same segment where the related assets are held. However, the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations is recorded in unallocated corporate expense within operating income as such depreciation is not allocable to government contracts and not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance.\nMajor classes of property, plant and equipment and their useful lives are as follows:\n(1)\nLand is not a depreciable asset.\n(2)\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or lease term.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the company completed a sale of equipment to a customer on a restricted Aeronautics Systems program for $\n444\nmillion. The company previously intended to use the equipment for internal purposes so we recognized the acquisition costs as capital expenditures and included the equipment in property, plant and equipment. As we regularly sell this type of equipment to customers in the ordinary course of business, we recorded the sale as a revenue transaction and included the net book value of the equipment in Operating costs and expenses. Although we generally classify proceeds from revenue transactions as cash inflows from operating activities, we recognized the proceeds from this transaction as cash inflows from investing activities, consistent with our prior recognition of the cost to acquire the equipment as capital expenditures. The company received cash\n-62-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\npayments of $\n155\nmillion, $\n84\nmillion and $\n205\nmillion related to the equipment sale during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and included it in Proceeds from sale of equipment to a customer in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the company acquired $\n46\nmillion of internal use software through long-term financing directly with the supplier. The software was recorded in PP&E as a non-cash investing activity and the related liability was recorded in long-term debt as a non-cash financing activity. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the company received lease incentives for landlord funded leasehold improvements of $\n96\nmillion and $\n150\nmillion, respectively, related to a Space Systems real estate lease, which were recorded in PP&E and included in non-cash investing activities.\nOn December 28, 2022 the company acquired certain leased land in exchange for company-owned land, which had been used previously for production-related activities at Space Systems. The exchange was accounted for as a nonmonetary transaction, and the acquired land, valued at approximately $\n155\nmillion, was recorded in PP&E as a non-cash investing activity. The transaction resulted in a $\n96\nmillion gain, which was reflected in operating costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\nNon-cash investing activities also include capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid of $\n113\nmillion, $\n91\nmillion and $\n72\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Purchased Intangible Assets\nThe company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually as of December 31, or when an indicator of potential impairment exists. When performing the goodwill impairment test, the company uses a discounted cash flow approach corroborated by comparative market multiples, where appropriate, to determine the fair value of its reporting units.\nGoodwill and other purchased intangible asset balances are included in the identifiable assets of their assigned business segment. However, the company includes the amortization of other purchased intangible assets in unallocated corporate expense within operating income as such amortization is not allocable to government contracts and not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance. The company’s customer-related intangible assets are generally amortized over their respective useful lives based on the pattern in which the future economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be consumed. Other intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nLeases\nThe company leases certain buildings, land and equipment. At contract inception, we determine whether a contract is or contains a lease and whether the lease should be classified as an operating or finance lease. Operating lease balances are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Other current liabilities, and Operating lease liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position.\nThe company recognizes operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of future payments and the appropriate lease classification. Many of our leases include renewal options aligned with our contract terms. We define the initial lease term to include renewal options determined to be reasonably certain. We do not recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We elected the practical expedient to not separate lease components from nonlease components and applied that practical expedient to all material classes of leased assets.\nMany of the company’s real property lease agreements contain incentives for tenant improvements, rent holidays or rent escalation clauses. For tenant improvement incentives received, if the incentive is determined to be a leasehold improvement owned by the lessee, the company generally records the incentives as a reduction to the right-of-use asset, which reduces rent expense over the lease term. For rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during the lease term, the company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For these lease incentives, the company uses the date of initial possession as the commencement date, which is generally when the company is given the right of access to the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use.\nFinance leases are not material to our consolidated financial statements and the company is not a lessor in any material arrangements. We do not have any material restrictions or covenants in our lease agreements, sale-leaseback transactions, land easements or residual value guarantees.\n-63-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nLitigation, Commitments and Contingencies\nWe accrue for litigation, commitments and contingencies when management, after considering the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to management, has determined it is probable a liability will be found to have been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of amounts is reasonably estimable and no amount within the range is more likely than another, the low end of the range is recorded. Legal fees are generally expensed as incurred. Due to the inherent uncertainties surrounding gain contingencies, we generally do not recognize potential gains until realized.\nEnvironmental Costs\nWe accrue for environmental liabilities when management determines that, based on the facts and circumstances known to the company, it is probable the company will incur costs to address environmental impacts and the costs are reasonably estimable. When only a range of amounts is reasonably estimable and no amount within the range is more probable than another, we record the low end of the range. The company typically projects environmental costs for up to 30 years, records environmental liabilities on an undiscounted basis, and excludes asset retirement obligations and certain legal costs. At sites involving multiple parties, we accrue environmental liabilities based upon our expected share of liability, taking into account the financial viability of other liable parties.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe company sponsors various defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all of its employees. In most cases, our defined contribution plans provide for a company match of employee contributions. The company also provides postretirement benefits other than pensions to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, consisting principally of health care and life insurance benefits.\nThe liabilities, unamortized prior service credits and annual income or expense of the company’s defined benefit pension and OPB plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions.\nBecause U.S. government regulations provide for the costs of pension and OPB plans to be charged to our contracts in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements, we calculate retiree benefit plan costs under both FAS and CAS methods. While both FAS and CAS recognize a normal service cost component in measuring periodic pension cost, there are differences in the way the components of annual pension costs are calculated under each method. Measuring plan obligations under FAS and CAS includes different assumptions and models, such as in estimating returns on plan assets, calculating interest expense and the periods over which gains/losses related to pension assets and actuarial changes are recognized. As a result, annual retiree benefit plan expense amounts for FAS are different from the amounts for CAS in any given reporting period even though the ultimate cost of providing benefits over the life of the plans is the same under either method. CAS retiree benefit plan costs are charged to contracts and are included in segment operating income, and the difference between the service cost component of FAS expense and total CAS expense is recorded in operating income at the consolidated company level. Not all net periodic pension expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated as production costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period.\nActuarial gains and losses are immediately recognized in net periodic benefit cost for FAS through MTM benefit (expense) upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement. Prior service credits are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized into earnings in future periods.\nStock Compensation\nThe company’s stock compensation plans are classified as equity plans and compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of stock awards (typically\nthree years\n), net of estimated forfeitures. The company issues stock awards in the form of restricted performance stock rights and restricted stock rights. The fair value of stock awards and performance stock awards is determined based on the closing market price of the company’s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based stock awards is determined at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. At each reporting date, the number of shares used to calculate compensation expense and diluted earnings per share is adjusted to reflect the number ultimately expected to vest.\n-64-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, are as follows:\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor all periods presented, the company had no material related party transactions.\nAccounting Standards Updates\nAccounting standards updates adopted and/or issued, but not effective until after December 31, 2022, are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position, annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n2.   DISPOSITIONS\nDisposition of IT and Mission Support Services Business\nEffective January 30, 2021, we completed the IT services divestiture for $\n3.4\nbillion in cash and recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n2.0\nbillion. The IT and mission support services business was comprised of the majority of the former IS&S division of Defense Systems (excluding the Vinnell Arabia business); select cyber, intelligence and missions support programs, which were part of the former CIMS division of Mission Systems; and the former Space Technical Services business unit of Space Systems. Operating results include sales and operating income for the IT and mission support services business prior to the Divestiture date; therefore, no sales and operating income were recognized for this business during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe company recorded pre-tax profit of the IT and mission support services business of $\n20\nmillion and $\n247\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n3.   EARNINGS PER SHARE, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK\nBasic Earnings Per Share\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of awards granted to employees under stock-based compensation plans.\nThe dilutive effect of these securities totaled\n0.7\nmillion,\n0.6\nmillion and\n0.5\nmillion shares for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 16, 2015, the company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $\n4.0\nbillion of the company’s common stock (the “2015 Repurchase Program”). On December 4, 2018, the company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to an additional $\n3.0\nbillion in share repurchases of the company’s common stock (the “2018 Repurchase Program”). Repurchases under the 2015 Repurchase Program commenced in March 2016 and were completed in March 2020, at which time repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Program commenced. Repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Program were completed in October 2021.\nOn January 25, 2021, the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional $\n3.0\nbillion in share repurchases of the company’s common stock (the “2021 Repurchase Program”). Repurchases under the 2021 Repurchase Program commenced in October 2021 upon the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2022, repurchases under the 2021 Repurchase Program totaled $\n2.4\nbillion; $\n0.6\nbillion remained under this share repurchase authorization. By its terms, the 2021 Repurchase Program is set to expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchases.\n-65-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nOn January 24, 2022, the company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional $\n2.0\nbillion in share repurchases of the company’s common stock (the “2022 Repurchase Program”). By its terms, repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program will commence upon completion of the 2021 Repurchase Program and will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchases. As of December 31, 2022, there have been no repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program and the company’s total outstanding share repurchase authorization was $\n2.6\nbillion.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the company entered into an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Goldman Sachs) to repurchase $\n2.0\nbillion of the company’s common stock as part of the 2018 Repurchase Program. Under the agreement, we made a payment of $\n2.0\nbillion to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of\n5.9\nmillion shares valued at $\n1.7\nbillion that were immediately canceled by the company. The remaining balance of $\n300\nmillion was settled on June 1, 2021 with a final delivery of\n0.2\nmillion shares from Goldman Sachs. The final average purchase price was $\n327.29\nper share.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the company entered into an ASR agreement with Goldman Sachs to repurchase $\n500\nmillion of the company’s common stock as part of the 2021 Repurchase Program. Under the agreement, we made a payment of $\n500\nmillion to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of\n1.2\nmillion shares valued at $\n425\nmillion that were immediately canceled by the company. The remaining balance of $\n75\nmillion was settled on February 1, 2022 with a final delivery of\n0.1\nmillion shares from Goldman Sachs. The final average purchase price was $\n374.79\nper share.\nShare repurchases take place from time to time, subject to market and regulatory conditions and management’s discretion, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The company retires its common stock upon repurchase and, in the periods presented, has not made any purchases of common stock other than in connection with these publicly announced repurchase programs.\nThe table below summarizes the company’s share repurchases to date under the authorizations described above:\n(1)\nIncludes commissions paid.\nDividends on Common Stock\nIn May 2022, the company increased the quarterly common stock dividend\n10\npercent to $\n1.73\nper share from the previous amount of $\n1.57\nper share.\nIn May 2021, the company increased the quarterly common stock dividend\n8\npercent to $\n1.57\nper share from the previous amount of $\n1.45\nper share.\nIn May 2020, the company increased the quarterly common stock dividend\n10\npercent to $\n1.45\nper share from the previous amount of $\n1.32\nper share.\n4.   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable, net represent amounts billed and due from customers.\nSubstantially all accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 are expected to be collected in 2023. The company does not believe it has significant exposure to credit risk as the majority of our accounts receivable are due from the U.S. government either as the ultimate customer or in connection with foreign military sales.\n-66-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nAccounts receivable, net consisted of the following:\n(1)\nIncludes receivables due from the U.S. government associated with FMS sales. For FMS, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government.\n5.   UNBILLED RECEIVABLES, NET\nUnbilled receivables, net represent revenue recognized under the cost-to-cost method that exceeds amounts billed to customers.\nSubstantially all unbilled receivables at December 31, 2022 are expected to be billed and collected in 2023. Progress and performance-based payments are reflected as an offset to the related unbilled receivable balances.\nUnbilled receivables, net consisted of the following:\n(1)\nIncludes unbilled receivables due from the U.S. government associated with FMS sales. For FMS, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government.\n6.   INVENTORIED COSTS, NET\nInventoried costs are principally associated with contracts where the U.S. government is the primary customer, therefore the company does not believe it has significant exposure to recoverability risk related to these amounts. Inventoried costs associated with our commercial businesses, while less significant in total, are subject to a greater level of recoverability risk. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the company recorded a $\n45\nmillion write-down of commercial business inventory at Space Systems for which its cost exceeded net realizable value.\nInventoried costs, net consisted of the following:\n-67-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n7.   INCOME TAXES\nFederal and foreign income tax expense consisted of the following:\nEarnings before income taxes associated with the company’s foreign operations are not material in the periods presented.\nIncome tax expense differs from the amount computed by multiplying earnings before income taxes by the statutory federal income tax rate due to the following:\nThe year to date 2022 ETR decreased to\n16.1\npercent from\n21.6\npercent in 2021 primarily due to an $\n86\nmillion benefit resulting from the resolution of the IRS examination of certain legacy OATK tax returns, as well as additional federal income taxes in the prior year resulting from the IT services divestiture. The company’s 2022 MTM benefit increased the 2022 ETR by\n1.2\npercentage points; however, the MTM benefit in 2021 did not significantly impact the 2021 ETR.\nThe year to date 2021 ETR increased to\n21.6\npercent from\n14.5\npercent in 2020 primarily due to the federal income taxes resulting from the IT services divestiture described above. The company’s 2021 MTM benefit did not significantly impact the 2021 ETR; however, MTM expense in 2020 reduced the 2020 ETR by\n1.3\npercentage points.\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds received, were $\n1.5\nbillion, $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n312\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Taxes receivable, which are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated statements of financial position, were $\n850\nmillion and $\n571\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n-68-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Northrop Grumman 2014-2020 federal tax returns and refund claims related to its 2007-2016 federal tax returns are currently under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination. During the second quarter of 2022, the company’s 2014-2016 federal income tax returns and refund claims related to its 2007-2016 federal tax returns reverted back from IRS Appeals to IRS examination for additional factual review. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation approved a resolution of the IRS examination of the legacy OATK federal tax returns for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015, the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2015 and calendar years 2016-2017, which resulted in a $\n110\nmillion reduction to our unrecognized tax benefits and an $\n86\nmillion reduction to income tax expense.\nTax returns for open tax years related to state and foreign jurisdictions remain subject to examination. As state income taxes are generally considered allowable and allocable costs, any individual or aggregate state examination impacts are not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. Amounts currently subject to examination related to foreign jurisdictions are not material.\nThe change in unrecognized tax benefits during 2022, 2021 and 2020, excluding interest, is as follows:\nOur 2022 increase in unrecognized tax benefits was primarily related to our methods of accounting associated with the timing of revenue recognition and related costs and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes related final revenue recognition regulations issued in December 2020 under IRC Section 451(b) and procedural guidance issued in August 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $\n1.7\nbillion in unrecognized tax benefits, including $\n543\nmillion related to our position on IRC Section 451(b). If these matters, including our position on IRC Section 451(b), are unfavorably resolved, there could be a material impact on our future cash flows. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months our unrecognized tax benefits may increase by approximately $\n120\nmillion. Additionally, it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, unrecognized tax benefits claimed primarily related to California state apportionment in the company’s 2007 to 2016 tax years may decline by up to $\n100\nmillion through administrative resolution with the California Franchise Tax Board.\nOur current unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in Other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position, were $\n728\nmillion and $\n590\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits included within Other non-current liabilities. These liabilities include $\n216\nmillion and $\n175\nmillion of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the income tax benefits from these tax positions are ultimately realized, $\n636\nmillion of federal and foreign tax benefits would reduce the company’s ETR.\nNet interest expense within the company’s federal, foreign and state income tax provisions was not material for all years presented.\n-69-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes. Net deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to year-end deferred federal, state and foreign tax balances, as presented in the consolidated statements of financial position, are as follows:\nRealization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. The company believes it is more-likely-than-not our net deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAt December 31, 2022, the company has available tax credits and unused net operating losses of $\n510\nmillion and $\n349\nmillion, respectively, that may be applied against future taxable income. The majority of tax credits and net operating losses expire in 2023 through 2046, however, some may be carried forward indefinitely. Due to the uncertainty of the realization of the tax credits and net operating losses, the company has recorded valuation allowances of $\n295\nmillion and $\n32\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\nUndistributed Foreign Earnings\nAs of December 31, 2022, the company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries and most have been taxed in the U.S. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these earnings, as well as future earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to fund our international operations. In addition, we expect future U.S. cash generation will be sufficient to meet future U.S. cash needs.\n-70-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n8.   GOODWILL AND OTHER PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nChanges in the carrying amounts of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, were as follows:\n(1)\nOther consists primarily of adjustments for foreign currency translation.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, accumulated goodwill impairment losses totaled $\n417\nmillion and $\n153\nmillion at Aeronautics Systems and Space Systems, respectively.\nOther Purchased Intangible Assets\nNet customer-related and other intangible assets are as follows:\nAmortization expense for 2022, 2021 and 2020, was $\n197\nmillion, $\n204\nmillion and $\n262\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the expected future amortization of purchased intangibles for each of the next five years is as follows:\n9.   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following table presents the financial assets and liabilities the company records at fair value on a recurring basis identified by the level of inputs used to determine fair value. See Note 1 for the definitions of these levels and for further information on our financial instruments.\nThe notional value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n221\nmillion and $\n120\nmillion, respectively. The portion of notional value designated as a cash flow hedge at December\n-71-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n31, 2022, was $\n87\nmillion. At December 31, 2021,\nno\nportion of the notional value was designated as a cash flow hedge.\nThe derivative fair values and related unrealized gains/losses at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\nThere were no transfers of financial instruments into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents and commercial paper approximates fair value.\n10.   DEBT\nCommercial Paper\nThe company maintains a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term financing. In December 2022, the company amended its commercial paper program to increase its capacity to issue unsecured commercial paper notes from $\n2.0\nbillion to $\n2.5\nbillion. There were\nno\ncommercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The outstanding balance of commercial paper borrowings is recorded in Other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2022, the company entered into a new five-year senior unsecured credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $\n2.5\nbillion (the “2022 Credit Agreement”). The 2022 Credit Agreement replaced the company’s prior five-year, $\n2.0\nbillion revolving credit facility entered into on August 17, 2018 and as amended on October 17, 2019. The revolving credit facility established under the 2022 Credit Agreement is intended to support the company’s commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. Commercial paper borrowings reduce the amount available for borrowing under the 2022 Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2022, there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under this facility.\nThe 2022 Credit Agreement contains generally customary terms and conditions, including covenants restricting the company’s ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets, merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes and incur liens.\nThe company also cannot permit the ratio of its debt to capitalization (as set forth in the credit agreement) to exceed 65 percent.\nAt December 31, 2022,\nthe company was in compliance with all covenants under its credit agreement.\nUnsecured Senior Notes\nRepayments of Senior Notes\nIn March 2021, the company repaid $\n700\nmillion of\n3.50\npercent unsecured notes upon maturity.\nIn March 2021, the company redeemed $\n1.5\nbillion of\n2.55\npercent unsecured notes due October 2022. The company recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n54\nmillion principally related to the premium paid on the redemption, which was recorded in Other, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\nDebt Exchange\nOn September 2, 2021, the company completed an exchange offer to eligible holders of the outstanding notes of our direct wholly owned subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (“NGSC”), maturing through 2036. An aggregate principal amount of $\n422\nmillion of the NGSC notes was exchanged for $\n422\nmillion of unregistered Northrop Grumman Corporation notes (the “Unregistered Notes”) with the same interest rates and maturity dates as the NGSC notes exchanged.\nOn June 15, 2022, the company completed a registered exchange offer pursuant to which the company exchanged an aggregate principal amount of $\n414\nmillion of the Unregistered Notes for $\n414\nmillion of new notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Registered Notes”) with the same interest rates and maturity dates as the Unregistered Notes.\nBecause the debt instruments were not substantially different in either of the exchange offers, both exchanges were treated as debt modifications for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.\n-72-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\n(1)\nThe current portion of long-term debt is recorded in Other current liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nThe estimated fair value of long-term debt was $\n12.1\nbillion and $\n15.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe calculated the fair value of long-term debt using Level 2 inputs, based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the company’s existing debt arrangements.\nIndentures underlying long-term debt issued by the company or its subsidiaries contain various restrictions with respect to the issuer, including one or more restrictions relating to limitations on liens, sale-leaseback arrangements and funded debt of subsidiaries. The majority of these fixed rate notes and debentures are subject to redemption at the company’s discretion at any time prior to maturity in whole or in part at the principal amount plus any make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on these fixed rate notes and debentures are payable semi-annually in arrears.\nTotal interest payments, net of interest received, were $\n474\nmillion, $\n570\nmillion and $\n572\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nMaturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2022, are as follows:\n-73-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n11.   INVESTIGATIONS, CLAIMS AND LITIGATION\nOn May 4, 2012, the company commenced an action,\nNorthrop Grumman Systems Corp. v. United States\n, in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. This lawsuit related to an approximately $\n875\nmillion firm fixed-price contract awarded to the company in 2007 by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for the construction and delivery of flats sequencing systems (FSS) as part of the postal automation program. The FSS were delivered. The company’s lawsuit sought approximately $\n63\nmillion for unpaid portions of the contract price, and approximately $\n115\nmillion based on the company’s assertions that, through various acts and omissions over the life of the contract, the USPS adversely affected the cost and schedule of performance and materially altered the company’s obligations under the contract. The United States responded to the company’s complaint with an answer, denying most of the company’s claims, and counterclaims seeking approximately $\n410\nmillion, primarily for delay and lost savings. On February 3, 2020, after extensive discovery and motions practice, the parties commenced what was expected to be a seven-week trial. After COVID-19-related interruptions, trial concluded on March 5, 2021. On June 27, 2022, the judge issued a decision in the company’s favor. On July 18, 2022, the government filed a motion for reconsideration. On October 17, 2022, the court denied the government’s motion for reconsideration and on October 19, 2022, the court entered judgment in the company’s favor. On November 9, 2022, the Postal Service paid the company the full judgment amount of approximately $\n83\nmillion. Neither party appealed prior to the December 19, 2022 deadline.\nThe company is engaged in remediation activities relating to environmental conditions allegedly resulting from historic operations at the former United States Navy and Grumman facilities in Bethpage, New York. For over 20 years, the company has worked closely with the United States Navy, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the New York State Department of Health and other federal, state and local governmental authorities, to address legacy environmental conditions in Bethpage. In December 2019, the State of New York issued an Amended Record of Decision seeking to impose additional remedial requirements beyond measures the company previously had been taking; the State also communicated that it was assessing potential natural resource damages. In December 2020, the parties reached a tentative agreement regarding the steps the company would take to implement the State’s Amended Record of Decision and to resolve certain potential other claims, including for natural resource damages. On September 22, 2021, the State of New York issued for public comment a new consent decree reflecting the agreement. On December 7, 2021, the public comment period closed. On August 3, 2022, the court approved the consent decree. We have also reached agreements with the Department of Defense and the Bethpage and South Farmingdale Water Districts to resolve claims involving these parties. Those agreements have also been approved by the courts as necessary. The company continues to be involved in related disputes with the Towns of Oyster Bay and Hempstead.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, as included in Note 12, substantial remediation costs related to the legacy Bethpage environmental conditions. It is also possible that applicable remediation standards and other requirements to which we are subject may continue to change, and that our costs may increase materially. In addition to disputes and legal proceedings related to environmental conditions and remediation at the site, we are a party to various individual lawsuits and a putative class action alleging personal injury and property damage in the Eastern District of New York. The filed individual lawsuits have been stayed, pending a court decision on class certification. We are also a party, and may become a party, to other lawsuits brought by or against insurance carriers, and by other individual plaintiffs and/or putative classes, as well as other parties. We cannot at this time predict or reasonably estimate the potential cumulative outcomes or ranges of possible liability of these Bethpage lawsuits.\nIn June 2018, the FTC issued a Decision and Order enabling the company’s acquisition of OATK to proceed and providing generally for the company to continue to make solid rocket motors available to competing missile primes on a non-discriminatory basis. The company has taken and continues to take robust actions to help ensure compliance with the terms of the Order. Similarly, the Compliance Officer, appointed under the Order, and the FTC have taken and continue to take various actions to oversee compliance. In October 2019, the company received a civil investigative demand (CID) from the FTC requesting certain information relating to a potential issue regarding the company’s compliance with the Order in connection with a then pending missile competition. The company promptly provided information in response to the request. In late 2021, the company resumed discussions with staff at the FTC regarding our response and their views on compliance issues. More recently, the company received and is responding to a follow-on CID. We cannot predict the outcome of those discussions, but we do not believe they are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2022, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows. We believe the company has been and continues to be in compliance with the Order.\nOn December 9, 2022, the company received from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) a criminal subpoena seeking information regarding financial and cost accounting and controls that appears focused on the interest rate\n-74-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nassumptions the company used to determine our CAS pension expense, which we have previously discussed in Note 12 below. The company has begun discussions with DOJ regarding the scope of the subpoena and is preparing to respond to it. We cannot at this point predict the outcome of this matter.\nThe company is a party to various other investigations, lawsuits, arbitration, claims, enforcement actions and other legal proceedings, including government investigations and claims, that arise in the ordinary course of our business. The nature of legal proceedings is such that we cannot assure the outcome of any particular matter. However, based on information available to the company to date, the company does not believe that the outcome of any of these other matters pending against the company is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2022, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n12.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nU.S. Government Cost Claims and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the company is advised of claims by the U.S. government concerning certain potential disallowed costs, plus, at times, penalties and interest. When such findings are presented, the company and U.S. government representatives engage in discussions to enable the company to evaluate the merits of these claims, as well as to assess the amounts being claimed. Where appropriate, provisions are made to reflect the company’s estimated exposure for such potential disallowed costs. Such provisions are reviewed periodically using the most recent information available. The company believes it has adequately reserved for disputed amounts that are probable and reasonably estimable, and that the outcome of any such matters would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position\nas of December 31, 2022, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIn 2019, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) raised questions about an interest rate assumption used by the company to determine our CAS pension expense. On June 1, 2020, DCMA provided written notice that the assumptions the company used during the period 2013-2019 were potentially noncompliant with CAS. We submitted a formal response on July 31, 2020, which we believed demonstrates the appropriateness of the assumptions used. On November 24, 2020, DCMA replied to the company’s response, disagreeing with our position and requesting additional input, which we provided on February 22, 2021. We continued to exchange correspondence and engage with DCMA and DoD on this matter, including responding to requests for and providing additional information. As noted in Note 11 above, on December 8, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) issued to the company a criminal subpoena seeking information that appears related to the interest rate assumptions at issue in our discussions with DCMA. The company has begun discussions with DOJ regarding the scope of the subpoena and is preparing to respond to it. We cannot at this point predict the outcome of this matter.\nThe company is also continuing to engage with DCMA/DoD. As previously described, the sensitivity to changes in interest rate assumptions makes it reasonably possible the outcome of the DCMA matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows, although we are not currently able to estimate a range of any potential loss.\nB-21 Low-Rate Initial Production Options\nIn 2015, the U.S. Air Force awarded to Northrop Grumman the B-21 contract, including a base contract for engineering, manufacturing, and design (EMD) and five low-rate initial production (LRIP) options. The EMD phase of the program is largely cost type and began at contract award. The LRIP options are largely fixed price and are expected to be awarded and executed over the next decade. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we updated our estimated cost to complete the LRIP phase of the B-21 program. Principally due to the company’s latest estimate of the impact macroeconomic factors may have on our cost to complete the LRIP options, as well as ongoing discussions with our suppliers and our customer, we now believe it is reasonably possible one or more of the LRIP options could be performed at a loss and the range of such loss across the five LRIP options is between $\n0\nand $\n1.2\nbillion. As we do\n-75-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nnot currently believe a loss is probable on any of the LRIP options, we have not recognized any such loss in our financial results for the period ended December 31, 2022.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe table below summarizes the amount accrued for environmental remediation costs, management’s estimate of the amount of reasonably possible future costs in excess of accrued costs and the deferred costs expected to be recoverable through overhead charges on U.S. government contracts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2022, $\n198\nmillion is recorded in Other current liabilities and $\n367\nmillion is recorded in Other non-current liabilities.\n(2)\nEstimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value. The reasonably possible future costs in excess of accrued costs do not take into consideration amounts expected to be recoverable through overhead charges on U.S. government contracts.\n(3)\nAs of December 31, 2022, $\n180\nmillion is deferred in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and $\n306\nmillion is deferred in Other non-current assets.\nThese amounts are evaluated for recoverability on a routine basis.\nAlthough management cannot predict whether (i) new information gained as our environmental remediation projects progress, (ii) changes in remediation standards or other requirements to which we are subject, or (iii) other changes in facts and circumstances will materially affect the estimated liability accrued, we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures associated with our currently identified projects will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2022, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\nFinancial Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance on certain obligations. At December 31, 2022, there were $\n373\nmillion of stand-by letters of credit and guarantees and $\n77\nmillion of surety bonds outstanding.\nIndemnifications\nThe company has provided indemnifications for certain environmental, income tax and other potential liabilities in connection with certain of its divestitures. The settlement of these liabilities is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2022, or its annual results of operations and/or cash flows.\n13.   RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nPlan Descriptions\nU.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n– The company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. Pension benefits for most participants are based on years of service, age and compensation. It is our policy to fund at least the minimum amount required for qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under U.S. government regulations, by making payments into benefit trusts separate from the company.\nU.S. Defined Contribution Plans\n– The company also sponsors defined contribution plans covering the majority of its employees, including certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Company contributions vary depending on date of hire, with a majority of employees being eligible for employer matching of employee contributions. Based on date of hire, certain employees are eligible to receive a company non-elective contribution or an enhanced matching contribution in lieu of a defined benefit pension plan benefit. The company’s contributions to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $\n558\nmillion, $\n588\nmillion and $\n590\nmillion, respectively.\nNon-U.S. Benefit Plans –\nThe company sponsors several benefit plans for non-U.S. employees. These plans are designed to provide benefits appropriate to local practice and in accordance with local regulations. Some of these plans are funded using benefit trusts separate from the company.\n-76-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nMedical and Life Benefits\n– The company funds a portion of the costs for certain health care and life insurance benefits for a substantial number of its active and retired employees. In addition to a company and employee cost-sharing feature, the health plans also have provisions for deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance percentages, out-of-pocket limits, conformance to a schedule of reasonable fees, the use of managed care providers and coordination of benefits with other plans. The plans also provide for a Medicare carve-out. The company reserves the right to amend or terminate the plans at any time.\nCertain covered employees and dependents are eligible to participate in plans upon retirement if they meet specified age and years of service requirements. The company provides subsidies to reimburse certain retirees for a portion of the cost of individual Medicare-supplemental coverage purchased directly by the retiree through a private insurance exchange. The company has capped the amount of its contributions for substantially all of its remaining postretirement medical and life benefit plans. In addition, after January 1, 2005 (or earlier at some businesses), newly hired employees are not eligible for subsidized postretirement medical and life benefits.\nSummary Plan Results\nThe cost to the company of its retirement benefit plans is shown in the following table:\nThe table below summarizes the components of changes in unamortized prior service credit (cost) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022:\nThe following table sets forth the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position for the company’s defined benefit retirement plans. Pension benefits data includes the qualified plans, foreign plans and U.S. unfunded non-qualified plans for benefits provided to directors, officers and certain employees. The company uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.\n-77-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe decrease in the fair value of our plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 was principally driven by losses of\n15.4\npercent on plan assets and $\n2.1\nbillion of benefit payments. The decrease in our projected benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by a\n256\nbasis point increase in the discount rate from year end 2021 and $\n2.1\nbillion of benefit payments, partially offset by $\n1.2\nbillion of interest cost.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n28.8\nbillion and $\n38.3\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAmounts for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of fair value of plan assets are as follows:\n-78-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nPlan Assumptions\nOn a weighted-average basis, the following assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 of each year and net periodic benefit cost for the following year:\nPlan Assets and Investment Policy\nPlan assets are invested in various asset classes that are expected to produce a sufficient level of diversification and investment return over the long term. Through consultation with our investment management team and outside investment advisers, management develops expected long-term returns for each of the plans’ strategic asset classes. In doing so, we consider a number of factors, including our historical investment performance, current market data such as yields/price-earnings ratios, historical market returns over long periods and periodic surveys of investment managers’ expectations. Liability studies are conducted on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to balance risk. Risk targets are established and monitored against acceptable ranges.\nOur investment policies and procedures are designed to ensure the plans’ investments are in compliance with ERISA. Guidelines are established defining permitted investments within each asset class. Derivatives are used for transitioning assets, asset class rebalancing, managing currency risk and for management of fixed-income and alternative investments.\nFor the majority of the plans’ assets, the investment policies require that the asset allocation be maintained within the following ranges as of December 31, 2022:\n-79-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe table below provides the fair values of the company’s pension and Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset category. The table also identifies the level of inputs used to determine the fair value of assets in each category. See Note 1 for the definitions of these levels. Certain investments that are measured at fair value using NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be categorized in the fair value hierarchy table. The total fair value of these investments is included in the table below to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to amounts presented in the funded status table. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no investments expected to be sold at a value materially different than NAV.\nThere were no transfers of plan assets into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nGenerally, investments are valued based on information in financial publications of general circulation, statistical and valuation services, records of security exchanges, appraisal by qualified persons, transactions and bona fide offers. Cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in money market or short-term investment funds. U.S. and international equities consist primarily of common stocks and institutional common trust funds. Investments in certain equity securities, which include domestic and international securities and registered investment companies, and exchange-traded funds with fixed income strategies are valued at the last reported sales or quoted price on the last business day of the reporting period. Fair values for certain fixed-income securities, which are not exchange-traded, are valued using third-party pricing services.\nOther assets include derivative assets with a fair value of $\n71\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion, derivative liabilities with a fair value of $\n117\nmillion and $\n38\nmillion, and net notional amounts of $\n3.2\nbillion and $\n3.7\nbillion, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Derivative instruments may include exchange traded futures contracts, interest rate swaps, options on futures and swaps, currency contracts, total return swaps and credit default swaps. Notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the pension and VEBA trusts, but are used in the\n-80-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\ncalculation of cash settlement under the contracts. The volume of derivative activity is commensurate with the amounts disclosed at year-end. Certain derivative financial instruments within the pension trust are subject to master netting agreements with certain counterparties.\nInvestments in certain equity and fixed-income funds, which include common/collective trust funds, and alternative investments, including hedge funds, opportunistic investments, private equity funds and real estate funds, are valued based on the NAV derived by the investment managers, as a practical expedient, and are described further below.\nU.S. and International equities: Generally, redemption periods are\ndaily, monthly or quarterly\nwith a notice requirement less than\n90\ndays.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were\nno\nunfunded commitments. As of December 31, 2021, unfunded commitments were $\n100\nmillion.\nFixed-income funds: Generally, redemption periods are\ndaily, monthly or quarterly\nwith a notice requirement of\ntwo days\n. There\nwere\nno\nunfunded commitments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nHedge funds: Consist of closed-end funds with a\n5\n-\n10\nyear life as well as funds that allow redemption requests subject to the liquidity limitations of the underlying investments.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unfunded commitments were $\n6\nmillion.\nOpportunistic investments: Primarily held in partnerships with a\n5\n-\n10\nyear life.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unfunded commitments were $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion, respectively.\nPrivate equity funds: The term of each fund is typically\n10\nor more years and the fund’s investors do not have an option to redeem their interest in the fund.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unfunded commitments were $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n2.1\nbillion, respectively.\nReal estate funds: Consist primarily of open-end funds that generally allow investors to redeem their interests in the funds. Certain closed-end real estate funds have terms of\n10\nor more years. A\ns of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unfunded commitments were $\n44\nmillion and $\n350\nmillion, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the defined benefit pension and VEBA trusts did not hold any Northrop Grumman common stock.\nBenefit Payments\nThe following table reflects estimated future benefit payments for the next ten years, based upon the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation, and includes expected future employee service, as of December 31, 2022:\nIn 2023, the company expects to contribute the required minimum funding of approximately $\n100\nmillion to its pension plans and approximately $\n36\nmillion to its medical and life benefit plans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the company made\nno\ndiscretionary pension contributions.\n14.   STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS AND OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS\nStock Compensation Plans\nAt December 31, 2022, the company had stock-based compensation awards outstanding under the following shareholder-approved plans: the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (2011 Plan), applicable to employees and non-employee directors, and the 1993 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (1993 SPND).\nEmployee Plans\n– In May 2015, the company’s shareholders approved amendments to the 2011 Plan. These amendments provided that shares issued under the plan would be counted against the aggregate share limit on a one-for-one basis. As amended,\n5.1\nmillion shares plus\n2.4\nmillion of newly authorized shares were available for issuance under the 2011 Plan; as of December 31, 2022,\n4.6\nmillion shares remain available for issuance.\n-81-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nThe 2011 Plan provides for the following equity awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and stock awards. Under the 2011 Plan, no SARs have been granted and there are no outstanding stock options. Stock awards include restricted performance stock rights (RPSR) and restricted stock rights (RSR). RPSRs generally vest and are paid following the completion of a three-year performance period, based primarily on achievement of certain performance metrics determined by the Board. RSRs generally vest 100% after three years. Each includes dividend equivalents, which are paid concurrently with the RPSR or RSR. The terms of equity awards granted under the 2011 Plan provide for accelerated vesting, and in some instances forfeiture, of all or a portion of an award upon termination of employment.\nNon-Employee Director Plans\n– Awards to non-employee directors are made pursuant to the Northrop Grumman Corporation Equity Grant Program for Non-Employee Directors under the 2011 Plan (the Director Program), which was amended and restated effective January 1, 2016. Under the amended Director Program, each non-employee director is awarded an annual equity grant in the form of Automatic Stock Units, which vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date. Directors may elect to have all or any portion of their Automatic Stock Units paid on (A) the earlier of (i) the beginning of a specified calendar year after the vesting date or (ii) their separation from service as a member of the Board, or (B) on the vesting date.\nDirectors also may elect to defer to a later year all or a portion of their remaining cash retainer or committee retainer fees into a stock unit account as Elective Stock Units or in alternative investment options. Elective Stock Units are awarded on a quarterly basis. Directors may elect to have all or a portion of their Elective Stock Units paid on the earlier of (i) the beginning of a specified calendar year or (ii) their separation from service as a member of the Board. Stock units awarded under the Director Program are paid out in an equivalent number of shares of Northrop Grumman common stock. Directors are credited with dividend equivalents in connection with the accumulated stock units until the shares of common stock relating to such stock units are issued.\nCompensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n99\nmillion, $\n94\nmillion and $\n90\nmillion, respectively. The related tax benefits (deficiencies) for stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $\n10\nmillion, $(\n2\n) million and $\n14\nmillion, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022, there was $\n97\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards granted under the company’s stock-based compensation plans. These amounts are expected to be charged to expense over a weighted-average period of\n1.3\nyears.\nStock Awards\nCompensation expense for stock awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period (generally\nthree years\n). The fair value of stock awards and performance stock awards is determined based on the closing market price of the company’s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based stock awards is determined at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For purposes of measuring compensation expense for performance awards, the number of shares ultimately expected to vest is estimated at each reporting date based on management’s expectations regarding the relevant performance criteria.\n-82-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nStock award activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, is presented in the table below. Vested awards do not include any adjustments to reflect the final performance measure for issued shares.\nThe majority of our stock awards are granted annually during the first quarter.\nThe grant date fair value of shares issued in settlement of fully vested stock awards was $\n93\nmillion, $\n103\nmillion and $\n118\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash Awards\nThe company grants certain employees cash units (CUs) and cash performance units (CPUs). Depending on actual performance against financial objectives, recipients of CPUs earn between\n0\nand\n200\npercent of the original grant.\nThe following table presents the minimum and maximum aggregate payout amounts related to those cash awards granted for the periods presented:\nThe majority of our cash awards are granted annually during the first quarter. CUs typically vest and settle in cash on the third anniversary of the grant date, while CPUs generally vest and pay out in cash based primarily on the achievement of certain performance metrics over a three-year period. At December 31, 2022, there was $\n119\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to cash awards.\n-83-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n15.   LEASES\nTotal Lease Cost\nTotal lease cost is included in Product and Service costs in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income and is recorded net of immaterial sublease income.\nTotal lease cost is comprised of the following:\nSupplemental Balance Sheet Information\nSupplemental operating lease balance sheet information consists of the following:\nOther Supplemental Information\nOther supplemental operating lease information consists of the following:\nMaturities of Lease Liabilities\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $\n82\nmillion in rental commitments for real estate leases that have not yet commenced. These leases are expected to commence in 2023 and 2024 with lease terms of\n4\nto\n12\nyears.\n-84-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n16.   SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe company is aligned in\nfour\noperating sectors, which also comprise our reportable segments: Aeronautics Systems, Defense Systems, Mission Systems and Space Systems.\nThe following table presents sales and operating income by segment:\nFAS/CAS Operating Adjustment\nFor financial statement purposes, we account for our employee pension plans in accordance with FAS. However, the cost of these plans is charged to our contracts in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment, previously referred to as the net FAS (service)/CAS pension adjustment, reflects the difference between CAS pension expense included as cost in segment operating income and the service cost component of FAS expense included in total operating income.\nUnallocated Corporate (Expense) Income\nUnallocated corporate (expense) income includes the portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable under the applicable FAR and CAS requirements, and therefore not allocated to the segments, such as changes in deferred state income taxes and a portion of management and administration, legal, environmental, compensation, retiree benefits, advertising and other corporate unallowable costs. Unallocated corporate (expense) income also includes costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets and the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations, as well as certain compensation and other costs.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the $\n2.0\nbillion pre-tax gain on the sale of our IT services business and $\n192\nmillion of unallowable state taxes and transaction costs associated with the divestiture were recorded in Unallocated corporate (expense) income.\n-85-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nDisaggregation of Revenue\n(1)\nSales to the U.S. government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. government. Each of the company’s segments derives substantial revenue from the U.S. government.\n(2)\nInternational sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer. These sales include foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government.\n(3)\nPercentages calculated based on total segment sales.\n-86-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n(1)\nPercentages calculated based on external customer sales.\n-87-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\n(1)\nAll other is principally comprised of the Middle East.\n(2)\nPercentages calculated based on external customer sales.\n-88-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION\nIntersegment Sales and Operating Income\nSales between segments are recorded at values that include intercompany operating income for the performing segment based on that segment’s estimated average operating margin rate for external sales. Such intercompany operating income is eliminated in consolidation\n, so that the company’s total sales and total operating income reflect only those transactions with external customers. See Note 1 for additional information.\nThe following table presents intersegment sales and operating income before eliminations:\nAssets\nSubstantially all of the company’s operating assets are located in the U.S.\nThe following table presents assets by segment:\n(1)\nCorporate assets principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, refundable taxes, deferred tax assets, property, plant and equipment, marketable securities and deferred costs associated with certain environmental matters.\nCapital Expenditures and Depreciation and Amortization\nThe following table presents capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization by segment:\n(1)\nCorporate amounts include the amortization of purchased intangible assets and the additional depreciation expense related to the step-up in fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations as they are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance.\n(2)\nBeginning in 2022, depreciation and amortization amounts include the amortization expense related to the company’s right-of-use assets. Prior year amounts have been recast to conform to current year presentation. This change in presentation had no impact on depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.\n-89-\nNORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION"

This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. The company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nTo comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, the company designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting across the enterprise. The assessment of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting is based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly monitors its internal control over financial reporting, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP issued an attestation report dated January 25, 2023, concerning the company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is contained in this Annual Report. The company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\n/s/   Kathy J. Warden\nChair, Chief Executive Officer and President\n/s/   David F. Keffer\nCorporate Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nJanuary 25, 2023\n-91-\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation\nFalls Church, Virginia\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Northrop Grumman Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 of the Company and our report dated January 25, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/   Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nJanuary 25, 2023"
