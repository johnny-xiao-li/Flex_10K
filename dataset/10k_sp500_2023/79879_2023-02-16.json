    "text": "PPG Industries, Inc. manufactures and distributes a broad range of paints, coatings and specialty materials. PPG was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1883. PPG’s vision is to be the world’s leading coatings company by consistently delivering high-quality, innovative and sustainable solutions that customers trust to protect and beautify their products and surroundings.\nPPG has a proud heritage with a demonstrated commitment to innovation, sustainability, community engagement and development of leading-edge paint, coatings and specialty materials technologies. Through dedication and industry-leading expertise, we solve our customers’ biggest challenges, collaborating closely to find the right path forward. PPG is a global leader with manufacturing facilities and equity affiliates in more than 70 countries.\nPPG supplies paints, coatings and specialty materials to customers serving a wide array of end-uses, including industrial equipment and components; packaging material; aircraft and marine equipment; automotive original equipment; automotive refinish; pavement marking products; as well as coatings for other industrial and consumer products. PPG also serves commercial and residential new build and maintenance customers by supplying coatings to painting and maintenance contractors and directly to consumers for decoration and maintenance.\nThe coatings industry is highly competitive and consists of several large firms with global presence and many firms supplying local or regional markets. PPG competes in its primary markets with the world’s largest coatings companies, most of which have global operations, and with many regional coatings companies.\nPPG’s business is comprised of two reportable business segments: Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings as described below:\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      3\nPERFORMANCE COATINGS\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      4\nINDUSTRIAL COATINGS\n(a) Original equipment manufacturer (OEM)\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      5\nResearch and Development\nTechnology innovation has been a hallmark of PPG’s success throughout its history. The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve, including a focus on sustainability, and leverage core technology platforms to develop products to address unmet market needs. Additionally, we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers and we customize our products for our customers' end-use applications. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management. We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding, where appropriate.\nWe own and operate several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes. In addition to the Company’s centralized principal research and development centers (see Item 2. “Properties” of this Form 10-K), operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate global competitive sourcing laboratories. Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform.\nRaw Materials, Energy and Logistics\nPPG uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products. The Company’s most significant raw materials include resins, reactants, solvents, titanium dioxide, epoxy and emulsions. Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials. Raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.\nMost of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and continues to make, supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. In support of our decarbonization efforts, we are increasing the amount of renewable energy secured for our operating facilities and increasingly evaluating alternative raw materials that offer sustainable benefits and support the circular economy, including recycled, bio-based, bio-circular feedstocks and biomass balance products. Prices for certain of our raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes; however, pricing may be impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil, natural gas, and other key feedstocks.\nThrough effective management of raw materials, energy and logistics, the Company aims to maintain a competitive cost position and ensure ongoing security of supply. Security of a sufficient supply of high-quality raw materials is important to PPG’s continued success as it allows the Company to increase production as necessary to keep pace with customer demand. In 2022, we continued to experience shortages of certain raw materials, which negatively impacted our ability to fully meet some of our customers’ demand. We continue to focus on improving our competitive cost position and expanding our supply of high-quality raw materials, including strategic initiatives to qualify multiple sources of supply.\nWe typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, government regulation, and global supply and demand factors. For 2022 versus 2021, we experienced increases in our operating costs of more than $1 billion, including significant raw material and energy cost inflation. The increases in raw material costs were primarily driven by higher supplier feedstock costs, higher energy prices, labor availability challenges, transportation shortages and higher ocean freight costs. Also in 2022, we experienced increases in other logistics costs, driven by supply chain disruptions, logistical challenges, labor shortages and manufacturing interruptions at both our factories and those of our suppliers and customers.\nGiven the uncertainty associated with the various factors that drive raw material prices, we are not able to predict the 2023 full-year impact of changes in raw material costs versus 2022; however, we expect the negative impact of raw material inflation to lessen as 2023 progresses.\nWe are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the regulation and registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes. Our ongoing, global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards. We anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      6\nOur commitment to sustainability extends to our suppliers as an extension of our internal focus on sustainability. The PPG Global Supplier Code of Conduct clarifies our global expectations in the areas of business integrity, labor practices, associate health and safety, and environmental management. Our Supplier Sustainability Policy builds upon our Global Supplier Code of Conduct by establishing expectations for sustainability within our supply chain. This policy reinforces our expectations that our suppliers, as well as their subcontractors, will comply fully with applicable laws and adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and corporate-governance standards.\nIn both 2022 and 2021, PPG earned a Gold rating from EcoVadis™, a trusted business sustainability ratings platform. EcoVadis experts evaluate company performance on 21 factors related to environment, labor and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement. The rating methodology is based on international sustainability standards and initiatives, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, United Nations Global Compact and ISO 26000 standard (social responsibility). Maintaining a Gold rating from EcoVadis underscores PPG’s ongoing commitment to corporate social responsibility and our efforts to manage our economic, social and environmental impact.\nGlobal Operations\nPPG has a significant investment in non-U.S. operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance to us of economic impacts occurring in any one region of the world. As a result of our global footprint, we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets, trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2022, unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased Net sales by approximately $775 million and Income before income taxes by approximately $85 million.\nRefer to Note 20, “Revenue Recognition” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional geographic information pertaining to sales and Note 21, “Reportable Business Segment Information” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for geographic information related to PPG’s property, plant and equipment.\nSeasonality\nPPG’s Income before income taxes has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and Cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in our architectural coatings and traffic solutions businesses. Demand for our architectural coatings and traffic solutions products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Latin American paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter. These cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher Cash from operating activities.\nHuman Capital\nThe average number of people employed by PPG during 2022 was approximately 52,000, of which approximately 15,600 were in the United States and approximately 36,400 were elsewhere in the world. The Company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world. We observe local customs, laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements. There were no significant work stoppages in 2022. While we have experienced occasional work stoppages and may experience some work stoppages in the future, we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms. To date, these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our results of operations. Overall, we believe we have good relationships with our employees.\nThe PPG Way is a set of behaviors that enables, empowers and engages each employee to fully live our values and realize our full potential as an organization. It guides our employees and leaders as we strive to achieve our purpose of protecting and beautifying the world. Employee engagement is a measure of the extent to which our employees are involved in, enthusiastic about, and committed to our work and workplace. We conduct employee surveys to increase dialogue among teams and implement meaningful action to improve results.\nOur human capital management strategies provide the foundation for our teams to thrive and deliver exceptional performance. These strategies in the areas of culture and purpose, employee engagement, development and pay equity are overseen by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. We are committed to ensuring our employees are safe, healthy, enabled, engaged and valued for the diverse talents they bring to PPG. We believe that having quality dialogue with our people, recognizing the value they bring and championing an authentic culture generates engaged employees and a company that is more innovative, productive and competitive. Our focus on and investment in learning and development are crucial to ensuring we keep our people engaged, productive and successful at every stage of their careers. We are committed to promoting from within wherever possible while also bringing in new ideas, thoughts and insights.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      7\nOur environmental, health and safety policy and standards define our expectations, and we implement programs and initiatives to reduce health and safety risk in our operations. We measure progress against our health and safety goals using the injury and illness rate, which is calculated as the number of illness and injury incidents per 200,000 work hours. For 2022 and 2021, our injury and illness rate was 0.30 and 0.26, respectively.\nOne of PPG’s greatest strengths is the diversity of our people, who represent wide-ranging nationalities, cultures, languages, religions, ethnicities, and professional and educational backgrounds. Their unique perspectives enable us to meet challenges quickly, creatively and effectively, providing a significant competitive advantage in today’s global economy. To ensure our people feel valued and respected, we are committed to providing a workplace that embraces a culture of diversity and inclusion and is free from harassment and bullying. In connection with our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, PPG operates eight Employee Resource Networks (“ERNs”). These ERNs are open to all employees and are intended to provide an opportunity for in-depth discussion, focus and recommendations on how PPG can deliver higher growth and performance by creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization.\nMore information about PPG’s human capital management strategies and our workforce can be found in the Proxy Statement for our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and in our ESG Report located at http://sustainability.ppg.com.\nEnvironmental Matters\nPPG is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our sustainability efforts are governed by the Sustainability and Innovation Committee of our Board of Directors. At the management level, day-to-day implementation of our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives is led by our Vice President, Global Sustainability, who is responsible for coordinating PPG’s ESG and sustainability programs and for communicating our ESG progress with our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. The Vice President, Global Sustainability works with PPG’s Sustainability Committee, a committee of management consisting of senior corporate executives, to establish and monitor our sustainability goals, policies, programs and procedures that incorporate sustainability into our business practices, including resource management, climate change impacts, innovation, community engagement, communications, procurement, manufacturing and employee wellness.\nOur dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability. We are marketing an ever-growing variety of products and services that protect the environment and provide safety and other benefits to our customers. Our products contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, airplanes and ships, and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption, conserve water and reduce waste. These products include compact automotive paint processes and low cure capabilities that save energy and reduce water usage at customer manufacturing sites; sustainable, waterborne coatings formulations; sustainable powder coatings; lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft; coatings that cool surfaces; coatings for recyclable metal packaging; antimicrobial products; coatings that contain reduced materials of concern; architectural coatings that contain lower carbon content raw materials; silica products for tires that improve vehicle fuel economy; and solutions for autonomous and battery-powered vehicles. Sales from sustainable products represented 39% of the Company’s total Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nPPG is committed to using resources efficiently and driving sustainability throughout our entire value chain, including continued focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water withdrawal and total energy use. More information about PPG’s sustainability values, efforts, goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found in our ESG Report located at http://sustainability.ppg.com.\nWe are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the industries in which it operates. PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including certain sites on the National Priority List. While PPG is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability. Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site. There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation. The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.\nOur experience to date regarding environmental matters leads us to believe that we will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites. Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time.\nIn addition to the $217 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      8\nsignificant. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.\nIt is expected that capital expenditures for such projects in 2023 will be in the range of $25 million to $35 million. Actual future capital expenditures may differ from expectations due to the inherent uncertainties involved in estimating future environmental remediation compliance costs, including possible technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors.\nManagement believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Refer to Note 15, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s website address is\nwww.ppg.com\n. The Company posts, and shareholders may access without charge, the Company’s recent filings and any amendments of its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its proxy statements as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company also posts all financial press releases, including earnings releases, to its website. All other reports filed or furnished to the SEC, including reports on Form 8-K, are available via direct link on PPG’s website to the SEC’s website,\nwww.sec.gov.\nReference to the Company’s, the SEC’s or other websites herein does not incorporate by reference any information contained on those websites, and such information should not be considered part of this Form 10-K."

    "text": "As a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty materials, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. Each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. While the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nEconomic Risks\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted and are continuing to adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe effects of the public health crisis caused by COVID-19 have interfered with the ability of PPG, our suppliers, customers, and others to conduct business and have negatively affected consumer confidence and the global economy. Public health officials have recommended or mandated certain precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in groups, shelter-in-place orders, vaccination requirements or similar measures. Preventative and protective actions that public health officials, governments or PPG have taken with respect to COVID-19 have and will continue to adversely impact our business, suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, reduced workforce availability, reduced ability to supply products, or reduced demand for our products. Our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by these preventative actions and the disruption to our business and that of our suppliers and customers. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of COVID-19, the negative financial impact to our business cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material.\nIncreases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. These raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.\nWhile not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. In most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower.\nMost of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Adequate supply of critical raw\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      9\nmaterials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, within Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, diversification of our resin supply including adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and other raw materials used in our product formulations. Despite our actions undertaken to maintain supply arrangements adequate to meet planned operating requirements, raw material supply chain disruptions, including logistical and transportation challenges in many regions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to procure raw materials, adversely impacting our financial results.\nAn inability to obtain certain critical raw materials has adversely impacted our ability to produce certain products and could do so in the future. Increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse effect on our Income from continuing operations or Cash from operating activities in the event we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner.\nThe pace of economic growth and level of uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our products and services depends, in part, on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. Recently, global economic uncertainty has increased due to a number of factors, including the war in Ukraine, COVID-19, consumer sentiment and commodity market volatility, disruption in supply chains globally, potential changes to international trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs, and labor shortages in certain regions of the world. PPG provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. This broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would result in reduced Income from continuing operations and Cash from operating activities.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our Net sales, Net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations which are expressed in U.S. dollars.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive.\nWith each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share, lose customers, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. Additionally, our ability to increase prices may impact the overall economics for the products we offer. Competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Tax Risks\nWe are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances. In addition, various laws regulate health and safety matters. The environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. Future environmental laws and regulations may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought.\nPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. Those lawsuits and claims may relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure,\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      10\nantitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. We believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including those described in Note 15, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are inherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, Cash from operating activities or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. We are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. These laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs.\nFor example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. Developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. Import/export sanctions and regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains.\nFurther, although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or businesses that we acquire. Any non-compliance or such improper actions or allegations could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory costs.\nChanges in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes. Our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Further, PPG may continue to refine its estimates to incorporate new or better information as it becomes available. Recent developments, including potential U.S. or international tax reform, the European Commission’s investigations on illegal state aid as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. If our effective income tax rate were to increase, our Cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our Cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational and Strategic Risks\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results.\nPPG has a significant investment in global operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. As a result of our operations outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. Our percentage of sales generated in 2022 by products sold outside the U.S. was approximately 60%.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      11\nBusiness disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, including those potentially due to climate change, significant public health issues, computer system disruptions, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of PPG, our customers and our suppliers. It is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. However, such events could reduce our ability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers.\nIntegrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.\nGrowth through acquisitions is an important component of the Company’s strategy. Over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including:\n•\ndifficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business;\n•\ndelays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products;\n•\ndiversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;\n•\ndifficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter;\n•\nunforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability, or existing information technology vulnerabilities;\n•\nunexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business;\n•\ndifficulty in conforming the acquired business’ standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and\n•\ndifficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses.\nThese risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures, or such anticipated benefits may never be realized, which could adversely affect our results of operations, Cash from operating activities or financial condition.\nOur ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve our business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\nWe believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years, including an increase in the production of electric vehicles. Vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our automotive refinish coatings. In addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new business models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive OEM new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive OEM coatings and related automotive parts.\nAdditionally, the development of customer-facing digital channels has and will continue to transform certain retail industries. An inability to develop such solutions and our customer’s pace of adoption of those solutions could negatively affect our business or the market demand for our products.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. If we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nIncreased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Despite our efforts to protect intellectual property and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to negative publicity, theft or other financial loss, modification or destruction of\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      12\nproprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations."

These lawsuits and claims may relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. To the extent these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury, property damage and certain other claims, PPG believes it has adequate insurance; however, certain of PPG’s insurers are contesting coverage with respect to some of these claims, and other insurers may contest coverage. PPG’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental, asbestos and other matters.\nFrom the late 1880’s until the early 1970’s, PPG owned property located in Cadogan and North Buffalo Townships, Pennsylvania which was used for the disposal of solid waste from PPG’s former glass manufacturing facility in Ford City, Pennsylvania. In October 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (the “DEP”) approved PPG’s cleanup plan for the Cadogan Property. In April 2019, PPG and the DEP entered into a consent order and agreement (“CO&A”) which incorporated PPG’s approved cleanup plan and a draft final permit for the collection and discharge of seeps emanating from the former disposal area. The CO&A includes a civil penalty of $1.2 million for alleged past unauthorized discharges. PPG’s former disposal area is also the subject of a citizens’ suit filed by the Sierra Club and PennEnvironment seeking remedial measures beyond the measures specified in PPG’s approved cleanup plan, a civil penalty in addition to the penalty included in the CO&A and plaintiffs’ attorneys fees. PPG and the plaintiffs settled plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief and PPG agreed to enhancements to the DEP approved cleanup plan and a $250,000 donation to a Pennsylvania nonprofit organization. This settlement has been memorialized by an amendment to the CO&A which was appended to a Consent Agreement between PPG and the plaintiffs which has been entered by the federal Court. The remaining claims in the case for attorneys’ fees and a civil penalty are not affected by this settlement. PPG believes that the remaining claims are without merit and intends to defend itself against these claims vigorously.\nFor many years, PPG has been a defendant in lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. For a description of asbestos litigation affecting the Company, see Note 15, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn the past, the Company and others have been named as defendants in several cases in various jurisdictions claiming damages related to exposure to lead and remediation of lead-based coatings applications. PPG has been dismissed as a defendant from most of these lawsuits and has never been found liable in any of these cases. After having not been named in a new lead-related lawsuit for 15 years, PPG was named as a defendant in two Pennsylvania state court lawsuits filed by Montgomery County and Lehigh County in the respective counties on October 4, 2018 and October 12, 2018. Both suits seek declaratory relief arising out of alleged public nuisances in the counties associated with the presence of lead paint on various buildings constructed prior to 1980. The Company believes these actions are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      13\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is information related to the Company’s executive officers as of February 16, 2023.\n(a)\nOn October 19, 2022, Mr. McGarry was elected as Executive Chairman, effective January 1, 2023.

A discussion of changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 has been omitted from this Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our 2021 Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 17, 2022.\nHighlights\nNet sales were approximately $17.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, driven by higher selling prices resulting from continued selling price initiatives. The Company increased net sales despite softer demand conditions in Europe due in part to geopolitical issues, pandemic-related demand disruptions in China and unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts due to the strong appreciation of the U.S. dollar versus many foreign currencies.\nIncome before income taxes was $1,381 million in 2022, a decrease of $434 million compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to raw material and other cost inflation, lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, higher manufacturing costs related to supply and labor disruptions and impairment and other related charges, partially offset by increased selling prices.\nPerformance Overview\nNet Sales by Region\nNet sales increased $850 million due to the following:\n● Higher selling prices (+11%)\n● Acquisition-related sales (+3%)\nPartially offset by:\n● Unfavorable foreign currency translation (-5%)\n● Lower sales volumes (-3%)\n● Divestiture-related sales and the wind down of Russia operations (-1%)\nFor specific business results, see the Performance of Reportable Business Segments section within Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      15\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $810 million due to the following:\n● Raw material, energy, wage and other cost inflation\n● Cost of sales from acquired businesses\nPartially offset by:\n● Favorable foreign currency translation\n● Lower sales volumes\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $62 million primarily due to:\n● Selling, general and administrative expenses from acquired businesses\n● Wage and other cost inflation\nPartially offset by:\n● Favorable foreign currency translation\n● Restructuring cost savings\nOther charges and other income\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $46 million 2022 versus 2021 primarily due the unfavorable impact of higher interest rates on PPG’s variable rate debt obligations and slightly higher levels of debt in the current year.\nInterest income\nInterest income increased $28 million primarily due to higher interest rates.\nImpairment and other related charges, net\nImpairment and other related charges of $290 million were recorded in the first quarter 2022 associated with the wind down of the Company's operations in Russia. Subsequently, the Company released a portion of the previously established reserves due to the collection of certain trade receivables and recorded recoveries due to the realization of certain previously written-down inventories, resulting in recognition of income of $63 million. The Company continues to consider actions to exit Russia, including a possible sale of its Russian business or controlled withdrawal from the Russian market.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded impairment charges of $14 million and $21 million, respectively, related to certain smaller, non-strategic businesses. PPG committed to plans to sell these business and they were reclassified as held for sale. The impairment charges recorded represent the excess net book value of the net assets over the anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. The revenue of these businesses represent less than 1% of PPG annual net sales.\nIn the fourth quarter 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $4 million to reduce the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived trademarks based on the results of the annual impairment test.\nRefer to Note 6, “Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets and Note 7 ”Impairment and Other Related Charges, Net” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      16\nPension settlement charge\nIn December 2021, the Company purchased group annuity contracts that transferred pension benefit obligations for certain of the Company’s retirees in Canada to a third-party insurance company. This transaction resulted in a pension settlement charge of $50 million. Refer to Note 14, “Employee Benefit Plans\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nAsbestos-related claims reserve adjustment\nIn 2021, the reserve for asbestos-related claims was reduced to reflect the Company’s current estimate of potential liability for these claims. Refer to Note 15 “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nBusiness restructuring, net\nPretax restructuring charges of $84 million related to recent acquisitions were recorded in 2022, partially offset by certain changes in estimates to complete previously recorded programs of $51 million. Pretax restructuring charges of $54 million were recorded in 2021, offset by certain changes in estimates to complete previously recorded programs of $23 million. Refer to Note 8, \"Business Restructuring\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nOther (income)/charges, net\nOther (income)/charges, net was lower in 2022 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $34 million gain on the sale of a production facility in 2021 in connection with the Company’s manufacturing footprint consolidation plans and associated restructuring programs as well as favorable legal settlements in 2021. Refer to Note 18, “Other (Income)/Charges, Net” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nEffective tax rate and earnings per diluted share, continuing operations\nThe effective tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 2022 was 23.5%, an increase of 2.9% from the prior year primarily driven by charges associated with PPG’s operations in Russia along with a reduction in the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions compared to the prior year.\nEarnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased year over year primarily due raw material cost inflation, lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact and higher manufacturing costs related to supply and labor disruptions, partially offset by increased selling prices. Refer to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results from Operations for additional information.\nRegulation G Reconciliations - Results from Operations\nPPG believes investors’ understanding of the Company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income from continuing operations, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, PPG’s effective tax rate and segment income adjusted for certain items. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income from continuing operations, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, the effective tax rate and segment income adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and should not be considered a substitute for net income from continuing operations, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, the effective tax rate, segment income or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and the adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.\nIncome before income taxes from continuing operations is reconciled to adjusted income before income taxes from continuing operations, the effective tax rate from continuing operations is reconciled to the adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations and net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share – assuming\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      17\ndilution (attributable to PPG) are reconciled to adjusted net income from continuing operations (attributable to PPG) and adjusted earnings per share – assuming dilution below.\n(1)\nEarnings per diluted share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Figures in the table may not recalculate due to rounding.\n(2)\nIn the first quarter 2022, the Company recorded impairment and other related charges due to the wind down of the company’s operations in Russia. Subsequently, the Company released a portion of the previously established reserves for Receivables and Inventories due to the collection of certain trade receivables and the realization of certain inventories. Also in 2022, impairment and other related charges were recorded for the write-down of certain assets and liabilities related to the planned sale of a non-core business and for certain asset write downs. In 2021, an impairment charge was recorded for the write-down of certain assets related to the previously planned sale of certain smaller entities in non-strategic regions. Net loss of $3 million related to the 2021 impairment charge was attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n(3)\nIncluded in business restructuring-related costs, net are business restructuring charges, accelerated depreciation of certain assets and other related costs, offset by releases related to previously approved programs and a $34 million gain on the sale of certain assets in 2021 in connection with the Company’s manufacturing footprint consolidation plans and associated restructuring programs. This gain is included in Other (income)/charges, net in the consolidated statement of income.\n(4)\nTransaction-related costs, net include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, other professional or consulting fees, and certain internal costs directly incurred to effect acquisitions, as well as similar fees and other costs to effect disposals not classified as discontinued operations. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income. Transaction-related costs also include losses on the sale of certain assets, which are included in Other income, net in the consolidated statement of income, and the impact for the step up to fair value of inventory acquired in certain acquisitions, which are included in Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of income.\n(5)\nIn early 2021, a winter storm damaged a southern U.S. factory supporting the Company's specialty coatings and materials business as well as other Company factories in the southern U.S. Incremental expenses incurred due to this storm included costs related to maintenance and repairs of damaged property, freight and utility premiums and other incremental expenses directly related to the impacted areas.\n(6)\nIn the fourth quarter 2021, the reserve for asbestos-related claims was reduced to reflect the Company’s current estimate of potential liability for these claims.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      18\nPerformance of Reportable Business Segments\nPerformance Coatings\nPerformance Coatings net sales increased due to the following:\n● Higher selling prices (+10%)\n● Acquisition-related sales (+3%)\nPartially offset by:\n● Unfavorable foreign currency translation (-5%)\n● Lower sales volumes (-4%)\n● Divestiture-related sales and the wind down of Russia operations (-1%)\nIn 2022, all businesses within the Performance Coatings reportable business segment achieved higher selling prices consistent with our focus on mitigating raw material and other cost inflation. These price increases also helped to offset softer demand conditions in Europe due in part to geopolitical issues, the impact of pandemic-related restrictions in China, softening do-it-yourself (“DIY”) demand and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nArchitectural coatings – EMEA net sales, excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions, divestitures and the wind down of Russia operations (“organic sales”) were flat compared to prior year as selling price increases were offset by lower sales volumes. Sales were negatively impacted by geopolitical uncertainty, including the war in Ukraine, lower demand for DIY paint products and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nArchitectural coatings – Americas and Asia Pacific organic sales increased a mid-single-digit percentage during the year primarily due to selling price increases that more than offset lower sales volumes. Sales in the U.S. and Canada were unfavorably impacted by raw material availability, which improved as the year progressed, and softening DIY demand. In Mexico, PPG Comex architectural coatings organic sales increased compared to the prior year as concessionaire network demand continued to be strong throughout 2022 and further selling price increases were implemented.\nAutomotive refinish coatings organic sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage due to selling price increases in all regions and volume growth in the U.S. stemming from higher miles driven, increased collision claims and more people returning to office work versus 2021. Sales were negatively impacted by softer demand in Europe and the impact of pandemic-related restrictions in China.\nAerospace coatings organic sales increased by a high-teen-percentage due to increased selling prices and sales volumes in all regions. Sales volumes increased in all regions compared to prior year, but still remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net sales benefited from continued strong demand for military applications and for PPG’s technology-advantaged products.\nOrganic sales in the protective and marine coatings business were higher by a mid-single-digit percentage due to selling price increases in all regions. Sales were negatively affected by pandemic-related restrictions in China.\nTraffic solutions organic sales increased by a low-teen-percentage as higher selling prices and solid volume growth in the U.S. and Latin America were partially offset by lower sales volumes in Europe and the Asia Pacific region.\nSegment income decreased $92 million year over year primarily due to raw material and logistics cost inflation, lower sales volumes and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher selling prices, savings from previously approved restructuring actions and acquisition-related earnings.\nLooking Ahead\nIn the first quarter 2023, demand conditions in Europe and China are expected to remain similar to the fourth quarter 2022, including potential pandemic-related disruptions. Raw material and transportation availability continue to improve, with the biggest challenges remaining in the aerospace coatings business. Aggregate sales volumes are anticipated to be lower by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter 2022 driven by the unfavorable impacts in Europe and China and continued soft architectural coatings DIY demand. The impact of divestiture-related sales and sales related to the Russia business, which the Company is in the process of winding down, are anticipated to reduce sales by about $40 million. The Company will continue to focus on executing various existing cost-savings initiatives.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      19\nIndustrial Coatings\nIndustrial Coatings segment net sales increased due to the following:\n● Higher selling prices (+13%)\n● Acquisition-related sales (+3%)\nPartially offset by:\n● Unfavorable foreign currency translation (-4%)\n● Lower sales volumes (-3%)\n● Divestiture-related sales and the wind down of Russia operations (-1%)\nIn 2022, all businesses within the Industrial Coatings reportable business segment achieved higher selling prices consistent with our focus on mitigating raw material and other cost inflation. These price increases also helped to offset softer demand conditions in Europe due in part to geopolitical issues, the impact of pandemic-related restrictions in China and unfavorable foreign currency translation.\nAutomotive OEM coatings organic sales increased by more than 10% led by higher selling prices in all regions and higher sales volumes in the U.S. and Latin America. Sales were unfavorably impacted by industry-wide production disruptions due to semiconductor chip shortages, which continued in 2022 but improved as the year progressed. Sales volumes were also impacted by lower automotive industry production due to the geopolitical uncertainty in Europe and the impact of pandemic-related disruptions in China.\nFor the industrial coatings business, organic sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage year over year as strong selling price increases in all regions and solid volume growth in the U.S. and Latin America were partially offset by reduced sales volumes in China and Europe reflecting lower economic activity in those regions.\nPackaging coatings organic sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage year over year due to higher selling prices in all regions. Sales volumes were strong in the U.S. but were negatively impacted by geopolitical uncertainty in Europe and pandemic-related restrictions in China.\nSpecialty coatings and materials organic sales increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year driven by higher selling prices in all regions and volume growth in Europe.\nSegment income decreased $37 million year over year primarily due to raw material and logistics cost inflation, lower sales volumes and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher selling prices and savings from previously approved restructuring actions.\nLooking Ahead\nIn the first quarter 2023, global industrial production is expected to remain at lower levels. In China, pandemic-related disruptions are expected to continue into the first quarter. Aggregate sales volumes are anticipated to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter 2022. Sales volumes are expected to be similar to the prior year quarter in the automotive OEM coatings business but lower in the industrial coatings, packaging coatings, and specialty coatings and materials businesses. Positive selling price is expected to continue, although some of the strong selling prices realized in 2022 will begin to reach their anniversary in the first quarter. Year-over-year segment margins are expected to continue to improve on a sequential basis in the first quarter 2023. The Company will continue to focus on executing against various existing cost-savings initiatives.\nReview and Outlook\nPPG’s net sales, excluding foreign currency translation impact, increased approximately 10% versus the prior year and were a record $17.7 billion. Organic sales increased by about 8% driven by higher selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Acquisition-related sales contributed 3% to net sales growth compared to prior year as the Company benefited from four strategic acquisitions that were completed in 2021. Foreign currency translation was unfavorable for the year and impacted net sales by about 5%. During 2022, severe cost inflation, supply disruptions, geopolitical issues in Europe and continuing impacts from the pandemic significantly impacted net sales and earnings. There was partial recovery in the end-use markets that were impacted by mobility restrictions in 2020 and 2021, such as automotive OEM, automotive refinish coatings and aerospace coatings, but all three remained below 2019 global demand levels. Demand\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      20\nwas mixed by geographic region. In the U.S. and Canada and Latin America regions, demand was solid throughout the year in most businesses despite supply disruptions constraining sales more than other regions. Demand was the softest in Europe due in part to geopolitical issues, including the war in Ukraine, with the largest impact on the architectural coatings business. In Asia, demand was mixed, as activity in China was impacted by ongoing pandemic-related restrictions and associated disruptions, while demand conditions in the rest of Asia were more stable. Despite ongoing component shortages that constrained global automotive OEM manufacturers’ production, global builds increased by about 6% versus 2021 due to strong underlying demand in most regions and supply deficits that are expected to remain into 2023. Raw material cost inflation trended higher for most of the year, finishing the fourth quarter about 35% above fourth quarter 2019 levels. In the fourth quarter 2022, raw material inflation began to moderate and is anticipated to ease further in 2023. Some other key costs continued to increase in 2022, including logistics, employee wage and benefit costs, and energy costs. The Company continued to collaborate with its customers to implement selling price increases to mitigate elevated input costs, resulting in an 11% increase in selling prices compared to 2021.\nU.S. and Canada\nIn 2022, economic activity remained robust and continued to recover from the lower demand levels experienced in 2021 due to pandemic-related restrictions. For the full year, U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) and industrial production increased by approximately 2% and 4%, respectively. Demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was strong at the beginning of the year but softened as interest rates increased as the year progressed. New home starts decreased by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2022 versus a mid-teen percentage increase in 2021. Residential remodeling was down by approximately 10% in 2022 versus 2021 as solid housing fundamentals were offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Commercial construction was down approximately 10% compared to 2021. Market demand for architectural paint continued to shift back to do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) from the DIY channel during the year as lower U.S. unemployment and increased mobility resulted in consumers choosing to hire professional paint contractors. Earnings were aided by strong selling price increases, but negatively impacted by higher levels of inflation, including historically high raw material cost inflation and higher than normal salary and wage increases due to the high level of employment in the U.S. Architectural coatings sales volumes in the U.S. and Canada were negatively impacted by severe raw material shortages that prevented the Company from meeting the demand for its architectural products, mostly impacting the higher demand periods of spring and summer.\nAutomotive OEM industry builds were up nearly 10% compared to 2021 as component shortages began to moderate and underlying demand for new automobiles was solid. The aerospace coatings business continued what is expected to be a multi-year recovery to return to 2019 activity levels. Before the pandemic, the Company’s sales mix was approximately 70% commercial and 30% military. During the pandemic and through 2022, sales volumes for military applications remained solid, in part due to specification of PPG products with advantaged technology. The commercial segment remains down about 15%, as overall improved flying activity still remains below 2019 levels, mostly impacted by lower activity in China. With the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions in China, it is expected that global commercial aftermarket and new build demand will continue to improve in 2023. The automotive refinish coatings business experienced strong demand through the year as miles driven and collision claims trended closer to pre-pandemic levels. Sales were constrained due to ongoing supply disruptions, which has led to lower industry inventory levels. The packaging coatings business was favorably impacted by new business wins at several new packaged beverage can customers and overall solid demand for the Company’s sustainable products. The traffic solutions business, which represents the Ennis-Flint acquisition completed in December 2020, made good progress realizing synergies and achieved a low-teen percentage growth in organic sales.\nU.S. and Canada organic sales increased by more than 10% compared to 2021 driven by higher selling prices in all businesses. Solid year-over-year sales volume increases in the aerospace, automotive refinish, industrial, automotive OEM and packaging coatings businesses were partially offset by lower year-over-year sales volumes in the architectural and protective and marine coatings businesses. Aggregate regional sales volumes remain more than 10% lower than the fourth quarter 2019. The U.S. and Canada remained PPG’s largest region, with sales of $7.4 billion, representing approximately 42% of 2022 net sales.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nEuropean demand for coatings softened in 2022, mostly impacted by geopolitical issues and high levels of inflation. Supply chain disruptions lessened during 2022 but continued to impact certain end-use markets, most notably automotive OEM. In the first quarter, activity in this region was negatively impacted by mobility restrictions associated with pandemic-related disruptions. While the impact of the pandemic eased throughout the year, consumer confidence worsened as the year progressed due to elevated costs and the war in Ukraine, which significantly impacted demand for coating products. Component shortages continued to constrain automotive OEM sales volumes. Automotive builds in 2022 were at similar levels as 2021.  Architectural coatings – EMEA organic sales were flat compared to the prior year as selling price increases were offset by lower sales volumes. Net sales for architectural DIFM products improved as compared to the prior year. Integration of the June 2021 acquisition of Tikkurila continued with good progress toward realizing targeted\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      21\nsynergies. In addition, the integration efforts continued for the two automotive OEM acquisitions made in 2021, Wörwag and Cetelon, with PPG continuing to realize acquisition-related synergies and leverage acquired product technologies to drive sales growth. Net sales were aided by partial recovery in the aerospace and automotive refinish coatings businesses. Demand was soft for architectural coatings, packaging coatings and general industrial coatings products.\nEMEA net sales of $5.5 billion represented 31% of PPG’s 2022 net sales, modestly higher than 2021. Organic sales improved by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to 2021 led by higher selling prices and acquisition-related sales, which were partially offset by lower sales volumes. Net sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, increased by a low-teen percentage. Sales volumes in the region were down a mid-teen percentage compared to 2019.\nAsia Pacific and Latin America\nThe regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 27% of PPG’s 2022 net sales in aggregate, similar to the prior year.\nNet sales were $2.8 billion in the Asia Pacific region, led by China, which remained PPG’s second largest country by revenue. Net sales in 2022 decreased by 5% compared to 2021 as higher selling prices and solid sales volume growth in India were more than offset by lower sales volumes in China due to pandemic-related restrictions and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Sales activity was most impacted in China during a period of heightened mandated shut-downs in the second quarter and during the fourth quarter as the country began to move away from its zero-COVID policy. In China, demand for coatings products is expected to improve in 2023 driven by stronger domestic consumption and fewer mobility restrictions. In the region, sales volumes were most unfavorable in the protective and marine, industrial, automotive refinish and packaging coatings businesses. In 2022, there were periods of strong automotive retail sales activity, partially due to government stimulus and strong sales of electric vehicles in China. During 2022, sales volume growth was strongest in India as the easing of pandemic-related restrictions led to increased economic activity. Sales volumes in the region were lower by about 10% compared to 2021 and were lower by a mid-teen-percentage compared to 2019.\nNet sales in Latin America in 2022 were $2.0 billion, representing a 16% increase compared to 2021. Overall, demand in the region increased year over year driven by improved economic activity in most end-use markets. Organic sales were higher by a mid-teen-percentage compared to 2021 due to higher selling prices and sales volumes. The PPG Comex business made strong contributions, which continued to outpace the industry. The business added more concessionaire locations during 2022, bringing the total to over 5,100 locations. Additionally, both reportable  segments delivered sales volume growth on a year-over-year basis. Sales volumes in the region increased by a low-single-digit percentage compared to 2019.\nOutlook\nWe expect softening global economic activity in 2023 that will likely be uneven by region and end-use. As 2023 progresses, we expect demand for architectural coatings products in the U.S. to be negatively impacted by higher interest rates, while we anticipate demand to gradually improve in China as it transitions away from zero-COVID policies and supply chain disruptions continue to ease. In Europe, we expect demand to remain soft due to ongoing geopolitical issues and inflation. In general, most end-use markets do not have significant excess inventories, and any demand improvement should lead to a faster ramp-up of sales volumes. Continued recovery is expected in the automotive refinish, automotive OEM and aerospace coatings businesses, which collectively accounted for about 40% of the Company’s pre-pandemic sales and where the Company has broad, global businesses supported by advantaged technologies.\nSupply chain and pandemic-related disruptions experienced during the past three years are expected to ease as 2023 progresses, which should allow for ample supply of commodity-related raw materials in all regions. We also expect the Company’s ability to manufacture and deliver product to improve as the year progresses, leading to better manufacturing efficiencies.\nWe anticipate that PPG’s growth in the U.S. and Canada will be led by the aerospace coatings, automotive refinish coatings and traffic solutions businesses. Automotive OEM industry builds in the region are expected to increase slightly compared to 2022. Architectural coatings demand is expected to moderate and may fall as the year progresses due to higher interest rates, lower single-family home construction and lower sales of existing homes. Traffic solutions and protective coatings demand should be aided later in 2023 as infrastructure spending continues to gain momentum.\nWe expect European industry demand trends in 2023 to remain similar to those experienced in the second half of 2022. Automotive OEM builds are expected to increase modestly from historical lows, and aerospace demand is expected to continue to recover from its pandemic lows. Overall demand is expected to be similar to 2022 but mixed by country in the architectural coatings business. The integration of Tikkurila will continue, and synergies from recent acquisitions should aid earnings growth. Unfavorable demand trends are expected to continue to impact the packaging, protective and marine, and industrial coatings businesses. We will continue to monitor the impacts of higher energy prices and challenges with respect to energy procurement in Europe and adapt our footprint, as necessary, to best serve our\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      22\ncustomers. Raw material availability is expected to continue to improve as the year progresses. A new cost savings program was announced in the third quarter 2022, which has a higher concentration of initiatives focused on Europe. We continue to monitor the economic environment in the U.K. as its exit from the European Union progresses, including monitoring the impacts on consumer sentiment, logistics, labor availability and coatings demand. To date, the U.K.'s exit from the European Union has not had a material impact on the Company's operations.\nIn the Asia Pacific region, we expect economic activity to improve in China after the first quarter as supply chain activity and mobility levels move closer to 2019 levels. Stimulus support is expected in the region to aid economic activity. Economic output in India is expected to remain robust, and activity in Southeast Asia is expected to benefit from the reopening of China’s borders. In China, we expect growth above the global average despite challenges in the real estate market and heightened risks as the Chinese economy continues to rely more on domestic consumption. The growth of China’s electric vehicle subsegment, including significant opportunities for export activity, should benefit the Company’s automotive OEM business. Marine coatings new-build demand is expected to be stable as order books for large vessels and container ships remain close to multi-year highs.\nIn Latin America, we anticipate continued stable economic conditions in Mexico, most of Central America and South America compared to 2022. We expect continued strong demand in the PPG Comex architectural coatings business.\nSignificant other factors\nWe made significant progress on the global restructuring programs that were announced in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The 2019 and 2020 programs have been substantially completed. In the third quarter 2022, the Company approved a business restructuring plan which included actions to reduce its global cost structure in response to current economic conditions. Total restructuring savings, including the impact of acquisition synergies, was approximately $65 million in 2022. Total restructuring savings are expected to be at least $60 million in 2023. We will continue to monitor and aggressively manage the Company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment.\nRaw materials are our most significant input cost. PPG experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors.\nOn an aggregate basis, average raw material costs were significantly higher in 2022 versus 2021. The increases in raw material costs were primarily driven by ongoing supply constraints, including various force majeure declarations, higher energy prices, production outages at many of our suppliers, energy surcharges in Europe, labor availability challenges, transportation shortages and higher ocean freight costs. PPG currently expects raw material costs to be higher by a low-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter 2023; however, we expect the negative impact of raw material inflation to lessen as 2023 progresses.\nWe achieved selling price improvement across all businesses in 2022, reflecting the Company’s efforts to offset various inflationary pressures. The Company will carefully monitor all costs during 2023 and assess the need for additional selling price increases.\nIn 2022, we experienced unfavorable foreign currency translation throughout the year, and we expect that foreign currency rates will continue to be volatile. However, the Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction-related impacts.\nThe 2023 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%, varying by quarter. This range represents the Company’s best estimate.\nNet periodic pension expense will be higher in 2023, primarily due to declines in the market value of pension investments during 2022, resulting in a lower asset base to generate returns on plan assets in 2023. The interest cost component of pension expense will also be higher due to an increase in discount rates.\nOver the past five years, the Company used over $2 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 21 million shares of PPG stock, including using $190 million to repurchase shares of PPG stock during 2022. The Company ended the year with approximately $1.1 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. During 2022, the Company deployed $114 million for acquisitions, $518 million for capital expenditures and $570 million for dividends. In 2022, PPG marked the 51st annual per share dividend increase and the 123rd successive year of annual dividend payments.\nPPG ended 2022 with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. The Company expects strong cash generation in 2023.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      23\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental Matters\nPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. Refer to Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” and Note 15, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits.\nAs discussed in Item 3 and Note 15, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.\nAs also discussed in Note 15, PPG has significant reserves for environmental contingencies. Refer to the Environmental Matters section of Note 15 for details of these reserves. It is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022\nNote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the Company’s recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years\nNote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2022 but are not effective until a future date.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the past two years, PPG had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans, and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments\nCash from operating activities - continuing operations\n2022 vs. 2021\nThe $599 million decrease in Cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to a larger increase in working capital in 2022 compared to the prior year, which reflects the impact of higher raw material costs on inventories and higher selling prices on trade receivables.\nOperating working capital\nOperating working capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities. Refer to Note 3, “Working Capital Detail” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to the components of the Company’s operating working capital. We believe operating working capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      24\nA key metric we use to measure our working capital management is operating working capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).\nEnvironmental expenditures\nWe expect cash outlays for environmental remediation activities in 2023 to be between $40 million and $60 million.\nCash used for investing activities\n2022 vs. 2021\nThe $1,943 million decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the Company’s prior year acquisition of Tikkurila.\nCapital expenditures, including business acquisitions\n(1)\nIncludes modernization and productivity improvements, expansion of existing businesses and environmental control projects.\nDuring 2023, capital expenditures, which are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, will support future organic growth opportunities. The Company will continue to deploy cash focused on shareholder value creation, with a preference for business acquisitions, coupled with debt reduction to enhance financial flexibility.\nCash (used for)/from financing activities\n2022 vs. 2021\nThe $502 million change was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in 2021 to finance the Company’s acquisition of Tikkurila.\nShare repurchase activity\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      25\nThe Company has approximately $1.1 billion remaining under the current authorization from the Board of Directors, which was approved in December 2017. The current authorized repurchase program has no expiration date.\nDividends paid to shareholders\nPPG has paid uninterrupted annual dividends since 1899, and 2022 marked the 51st successive year of increased annual per-share dividend payments to shareholders. The Company raised its per-share quarterly dividend by more than 5% to $0.62 per share paid in September 2022.\nDebt issued and repaid\nThe Company’s commercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt based on PPG’s intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis. Net payments on commercial paper were $440 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net proceeds from commercial paper were $190 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCredit agreements and lines of credit\nIn February 2021, PPG entered into a $2.0 billion Term Loan Credit Agreement (the \"Term Loan Credit Agreement\"). The Term Loan Credit Agreement provided the Company with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount $2.0 billion on an unsecured basis prior to December 31, 2021 as further discussed in Note 10, \"Borrowings and Lines of Credit\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In June 2021, PPG borrowed $700 million under the $2.0 billion Term Loan Credit Agreement. In December 2021, PPG borrowed an additional $700 million under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. In 2022, PPG repaid $300 million of the Term Loan Credit Agreement using cash on hand.\nIn August 2019, PPG amended and restated its five-year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in Note 10, \"Borrowings and Lines of Credit\" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company's existing five year credit agreement dated as of December 18, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides for a $2.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement will terminate on August 30, 2024. There were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement and Credit Agreement require the Company to maintain a ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization, as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and Credit Agreement, of 60% or less; provided, that for any fiscal quarter in which the Company has made an acquisition for consideration in excess of $1 billion and for the next five fiscal quarters thereafter, the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization may not exceed 65% at any time. As of December 31, 2022, Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization as defined under the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan was 49%.\nIn addition to the amounts available under lines of credit, the Company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.\nRefer to Note 10, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit and debt covenants.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      26\nCash Requirements\nWe continue to believe that our cash on hand and short-term investments, cash from operations and the Company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG’s significant cash requirements. The Company’s significant cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and commitments.\n(1)\nInterest on all outstanding debt.\n(2)\nIncludes interest payments.\n(3)\nThe unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.\nThe Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in the cash requirements table as well as letters of credit as discussed in Note 10, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOther liquidity matters\nAt December 31, 2022, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was\n$162 million. Th\ne timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. PPG does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if, or when, any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.\nContingencies\nContingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 15, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” and Note 13, “Income Taxes” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works. To accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. The Company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually. Refer to Note 14, “Employee Benefit Plans” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on these plans and the assumptions used.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities impacts the determination of future operating results. In addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      27\nintangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities.\nThe business and technical judgment of management was used in determining wh\nich acquired intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of acquired finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test at least annually, or more frequently if an indication of impairment arises. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount. In the quantitative test, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include discount rates, tax rates, future revenues, operating cash flows and capital expenditures. For more information on these matters, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nWe believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.\nCurrency\nComparing spot exchange rates at December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of many countries within the regions where PPG operates, most notably the Chinese yuan, the euro, and the British pound. As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2022\ndecr\neased by $266 million from December 31, 2021.\nComparing average exchange rates during 2022 to those of 2021, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of many countries within the regions PPG operates, including most of the countries in the EMEA region. This had an unfavorable impact of approximately $86 million on full year 2022 income before Income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts. Forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “outlook,” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the SEC. Also, note the following cautionary statements.\nMany factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements. Such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of COVID-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in Europe, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, PPG inventory levels, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of our acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, the amount of future share repurchases, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and government investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.\nConsequently, while the list of factors presented here and in Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      28\nConsequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or income, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. PPG undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as otherwise required by applicable law."

    "text": "PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Company’s risk management policies are provided in Note 11, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThe following disclosures summarize PPG’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates could impact PPG’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe conduct operations in many countries around the world. Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. Certain foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2022 and 2021 served as a hedge of a portion of PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $24 million as\nof both December 31, 2022\nand\nDecember 31, 2021\n. The potential reduction in PPG’s Income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European and Canadian currencies and 20% for Asian and Latin American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 would have been $304 million and $306 million, respectively.\nAs of both\nDecember 31, 2022\nand\nDecember 31, 2021\n, PPG had U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with notional amounts of $775 million. The fair value of these contracts were net assets of $88 million and $50 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $73 million and $77 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, PPG had non-U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $293 million and $178 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. PPG has interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The fair values of these contracts was a liability of $20 million and an asset of $36 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. An increase in variable interest rates of 10% would have lowered the fair values of these swaps and increased interest expense by $7 million and $1 million for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have increased annual interest expense associated with PPG's variable rate debt obligations by $4 million and by less than $1 million for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt by approximately $116 million and $56 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPG’s annual Income before income taxes or cash flows.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      29"

    "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PPG Industries, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of PPG Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Establishing and Maintaining Adequate Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      30\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nQuantitative Goodwill Impairment Test\nAs described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $6,078 million as of December 31, 2022, of which a portion was subject to a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Management tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test, at least annually, or more frequently if an indication of impairment exists. Management’s quantitative goodwill impairment testing, if deemed necessary, is performed during the fourth quarter of each year by comparing the estimated fair value of an associated reporting unit as of September 30 to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include projected future revenues, discount rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and tax rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the  quantitative goodwill impairment test is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit where a quantitative test was performed; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumption related to projected future revenues.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s quantitative goodwill impairment test, including controls over the valuation of the reporting unit where a quantitative test was performed. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit where a quantitative test was performed; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumption related to projected future revenues. Evaluating management’s significant assumption related to projected future revenues involved evaluating whether the significant assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 16, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      31\nManagement Report\nResponsibility for Preparation of the Financial Statements and Establishing and Maintaining Adequate Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on this evaluation we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting were effective.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their report, included on pages 30-31 of this Form 10-K, regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      32\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of these consolidated statements.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      33\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this consolidated statement.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      34\nConsolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this consolidated statement.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      35\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nThe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this consolidated statement.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      36\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PPG Industries, Inc. (“PPG” or the “Company”) and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and non-U.S., that it controls. PPG owns more than 50% of the voting stock of most of the subsidiaries that it controls. For those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company’s ownership is less than 100%, the outside shareholders’ interests are shown as noncontrolling interests. Investments in companies in which PPG owns 20% to 50% of the voting stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result, PPG’s share of income or losses from such equity affiliates is included in the consolidated statement of income and PPG’s share of these companies’ shareholders’ equity is included in Investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Transactions between PPG and its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates also include the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting from the allocation of the purchase price related to business combinations consummated. Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized as performance obligations with the customer are satisfied, at an amount that is determined to be collectible. For the sale of products, this generally occurs at the point in time when control of the Company’s products transfers to the customer based on the agreed upon shipping terms.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nAmounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are reported in Net sales in the consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company for the delivery of goods to customers are included in Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of income.\nSelling, General and Administrative Costs\nAmounts presented in Selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statement of income are comprised of selling, customer service, distribution and advertising costs, as well as the costs of providing corporate-wide functional support in areas such as finance, law, human resources and planning. Distribution costs pertain to the movement and storage of finished goods inventory at company-owned and leased warehouses and other distribution facilities.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to expense as incurred and totaled $\n252\nmillion, $\n243\nmillion and $\n223\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs, which consist primarily of employee-related costs, are charged to expense as incurred.\nLegal Costs\nLegal costs, which primarily include costs associated with acquisition and divestiture transactions, general litigation, environmental regulation compliance, patent and trademark protection and other general corporate purposes, are charged to expense as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as well as differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in Income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      37\nA valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets in situations where PPG determines it is more likely than not such assets will not ultimately be realized.\nPPG does not recognize a tax benefit unless it concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, PPG recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in PPG’s judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. PPG records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of most significant non-U.S. operations is their local currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into U.S. dollars using year-end exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents are highly liquid investments (valued at cost, which approximates fair value) acquired with an original maturity of three months or less.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments are highly liquid, high credit quality investments (valued at cost plus accrued interest) that have stated maturities of greater than three months to less than one year. The purchases and sales of these investments are classified as Investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nThe Company’s investment in marketable equity securities is recorded at fair market value and reported as Other current assets and Investments on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair market value recorded in income.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Most U.S. inventories are stated at cost, using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method of accounting, which does not exceed net realizable value. All other inventories are stated at cost, using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of accounting, which does not exceed net realizable value. PPG determines cost using either average or standard factory costs, which approximate actual costs, excluding certain fixed costs such as depreciation and property taxes. Refer to Note 3, “Working Capital Detail” for further information concerning the Company’s inventories.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments (a “derivative”) as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of the instrument.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on the derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet are reclassified into Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions are recorded in Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income, offsetting the gain or loss recognized for the change in fair value of the asset, liability, or firm commitment that is being hedged.\nFor derivatives, debt or other financial instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the gains or losses associated with the financial instruments are reported as translation gains or losses in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet. Gains and losses in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations are reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income upon a substantial liquidation, sale or partial sale of such investments or upon impairment of all or a portion of such investments. The cash flow impact of these instruments is classified as Investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nChanges in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes are recognized in Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income in the period of change.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      38\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of related assets. Accelerated depreciation expense is recorded when facilities or equipment are subject to abnormal economic conditions, restructuring actions or obsolescence.\nThe cost of significant improvements that add to productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When a capitalized asset is retired or otherwise disposed of, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation balance are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is recorded in Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. The amortization cost of finance lease assets is recorded in Depreciation expense in the consolidated statement of income. Property and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Refer to Note 4, “Property, Plant and Equipment” for further details.\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets less liabilities assumed from acquired businesses. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon their fair value at the date of acquisition.\nPPG is a multinational manufacturer with\n10\noperating segments (which the Company refers to as “strategic business units”) that are organized based on the Company’s major products lines. These operating segments are also the Company’s reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, which is tested at least annually in connection with PPG’s strategic planning process or more frequently if an indication of impairment exists. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. Quantitative goodwill impairment testing, if deemed necessary, is performed during the fourth quarter of each year by comparing the estimated fair value of an associated reporting unit as of September 30 to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model include projected future revenues, discount rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and tax rates. In 2022, the annual impairment testing review of goodwill did not result in impairment of the Company’s reporting units.\nThe Company has determined that certain acquired trademarks have indefinite useful lives. The Company tests the carrying value of these trademarks for impairment at least annually, or as needed whenever events and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. In the first quarter 2022, due to the adverse economic impacts of Russian military forces invading Ukraine, the Company identified indicators that the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and certain definite-lived intangible assets associated with the Company's operations in Russia may not be recoverable as of March 31, 2022, and the carrying value of those assets was assessed for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Company recorded impairment charges of $\n124\nmillion related to the indefinite-lived intangible asset and $\n23\nmillion related to definite-lived intangible assets in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 7, \"Impairment and Other Related Charges, Net\" for additional information.\nThe annual assessment takes place in the fourth quarter of each year either by completing a qualitative assessment or quantitatively by comparing the estimated fair value of each trademark as of September 30 to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated by using the relief from royalty method (a discounted cash flow methodology). The qualitative assessment includes consideration of factors, including revenue relative to the asset being assessed, the operating results of the related business as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. In 2022, the annual impairment testing review of indefinite-lived intangibles performed as of September 30, 2022 resulted in the Company recognizing a pretax impairment charge of $\n4\nmillion. Refer to Note 6, “Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets” for further details.\nIdentifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (\n1\nto\n30\nyears) and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nReceivables and Allowances\nAll trade receivables are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at the outstanding principal adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts and any charge offs. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce receivables to their estimated net realizable value when it is probable that a loss will be incurred. Those estimates are based on historical collection experience, current regional economic and market conditions, the aging of accounts\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      39\nreceivable, assessments of current creditworthiness of customers, and forward-looking information. Refer to Note 20, “Revenue Recognition” for further details.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if a contract is a lease at the inception of the arrangement. The Company reviews all options to extend, terminate, or purchase its right of use assets at the inception of the lease and accounts for these options when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. Certain real estate leases contain lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nVariable lease expense is based on contractual arrangements with PPG’s lessors determined based on external indices or other relevant market factors. In addition, PPG’s variable lease expense also includes elements of a contract that do not represent a good or service but for which the lessee is responsible for paying.\nNearly all of PPG’s lease contracts do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. For these contracts, PPG’s estimated incremental borrowing rate is based on information available at the inception of the lease.\nProduct Warranties\nThe Company accrues for product warranties at the time the associated products are sold based on historical claims experience. The reserve, pretax charges against income and cash outlays for product warranties were not significant to the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any year presented.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAn asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of that long-lived asset. PPG recognizes asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. The associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life. PPG’s asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the retirement or closure of certain assets used in PPG’s manufacturing process. The accrued asset retirement obligation is recorded in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and was $\n23\nmillion and $\n22\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPPG’s only conditional asset retirement obligation relates to the possible future abatement of asbestos contained in certain PPG production facilities. The asbestos in PPG’s production facilities arises from the application of normal and customary building practices in the past when the facilities were constructed. This asbestos is encapsulated in place and, as a result, there is no current legal requirement to abate it. Because there is no requirement to abate, the Company does not have any current plans or an intention to abate and therefore the timing, method and cost of future abatement, if any, are not known. The Company has not recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with asbestos abatement, given the uncertainty concerning the timing of future abatement, if any.\nEnvironmental Contingencies\nIt is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nThe Company classifies assets and liabilities as held for sale (a “disposal group”) when management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group, the sale is probable within one year and the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. The Company considers various factors, particularly whether actions required to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Any loss resulting from the measurement is recognized in the period the held-for-sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized until the date of the sale. When the disposal group is classified as held for sale, depreciation and amortization ceases and the Company tests the assets for impairment.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of prior years’ data have been made to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported Net income, cash flows or shareholders’ equity.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      40\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022\nEffective January 1, 2022, PPG adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2020-06, \"Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).\" This ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. Adoption of this standard did not materially impact PPG's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform.\" This ASU provided optional expedients and exceptions to U.S. GAAP for a limited period of time to ease potential accounting impacts associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). The amendments in this ASU applied only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that referenced LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The amendments in this ASU were effective through December 31, 2022. PPG did not apply any of the optional expedients or exceptions allowed under this ASU.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Years\nThere were no accounting pronouncements promulgated prior to December 31, 2022 that are not effective until a future date which are expected to have a material impact on PPG’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n2.\nAcquisitions\nThe pro-forma impact of the following acquisitions on PPG’s sales and results of operations, including the pro-forma effect of events that are directly attributable to each acquisition, was not significant.\nTikkurila\nOn June 10, 2021, PPG completed its tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Tikkurila Oyj (\"Tikkurila\"). Tikkurila is a leading Nordic producer and distributor of decorative paint and coatings, including an industrial paint business that produces paints and coatings for the wood and metal industries, among others. Immediately prior to the June 10, 2021 acquisition date, PPG owned\n9.3\n% of Tikkurila’s issued and outstanding shares. Immediately following the acquisition date, PPG owned\n97.1\n% of Tikkurila’s issued and outstanding shares. PPG continued to acquire the remaining shares not tendered during the tender offer period through a squeeze out process, ultimately achieving\n100\n% ownership of Tikkurila’s outstanding shares during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe results of this business since the date of acquisition have been reported within two operating segments: the architectural coatings – EMEA business and the industrial coatings business. The architectural coatings – EMEA business is included within the Performance Coatings reportable business segment and the industrial coatings business is included within the Industrial Coatings reportable business segment.\nEnnis-Flint\nOn December 23, 2020, PPG completed the acquisition of Ennis-Flint, a global manufacturer of a broad portfolio of pavement marking products, including traffic paint, hot-applied and preformed thermoplastics and raised pavement markers. PPG funded this transaction using cash on hand. The results of this business since the date of acquisition have been reported within the traffic solutions business within the Performance Coatings reportable business segment.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      41\n3.\nWorking Capital Detail\n(1)\nInventories valued using the LIFO method of inventory valuation comprised\n21\n% and\n29\n% of total gross inventory values as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the FIFO method of inventory valuation had been used, inventories would have been $\n272\nmillion and $\n174\nmillion higher as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n4.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n5.\nInvestments\nInvestments in equity affiliates represent PPG’s ownership interests in entities between\n20\n% and\n50\n% that manufacture and sell coatings and certain chemicals.\nPPG’s share of undistributed net earnings of equity affiliates was $\n25\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Dividends received from equity affiliates were $\n17\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      42\n6.\nGoodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets\nIn the first quarter 2022, due to the adverse economic impacts of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the Company recognized $\n147\nmillion of Impairment and other related charges, net in the consolidated statement of income related to certain definite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the Performance Coatings segment. Refer to Note 7, “Impairment and Other Related Charges, Net” for further details.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company tests the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks for impairment, as discussed in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” In conjunction with both the 2022 and 2020 annual impairment assessments, the long-term forecast of net sales for certain trademarks in the Performance Coatings segment was reduced as a result of historical performance, resulting in recognition of pretax impairment charges of $\n4\nmillion and $\n38\nmillion, respectively, in Impairment and other related charges, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In 2021, the annual impairment testing review of indefinite-lived intangibles did not result in an impairment.\nAggregate amortization expense was $\n166\nmillion, $\n172\nmillion and $\n138\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n7. Impairment and Other Related Charges, Net\nWind Down of Russia Operations\nIn the first quarter 2022, Russian military forces invaded Ukraine. This military action had significant and immediate adverse economic impacts on businesses operating in Russia and Ukraine. Based on deteriorating business conditions and regulatory restrictions, including the impact of economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States, the European Union and other governments, PPG immediately ceased sales to Russian state-owned entities, announced that the Company would cease all new investments in Russia and commenced actions to wind down most of the Company’s operations in Russia.\nBased on this change in facts and circumstances, the long-term cash flow forecast for the Company’s operations in Russia was significantly reduced. This reduction in the long-term cash flow forecast indicated that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with the Company’s operations in Russia may not be recoverable, and the carrying value of these assets was tested for impairment. Additionally, the Company evaluated trade receivables for estimated future credit losses, inventories for declines in net realizable value and other current assets for impairment in light of the deteriorating economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine. As a result, during the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recognized $\n290\nmillion of Impairment and other related charges, net in the consolidated statement of income, comprised of $\n201\nmillion of long-lived asset impairment charges and $\n89\nmillion of other related charges.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      43\nThe $\n201\nmillion of long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during first quarter 2022 was comprised of $\n124\nmillion related to indefinite-lived intangible assets, $\n54\nmillion related to property, plant and equipment, net and $\n23\nmillion related to definite-lived intangible assets. The $\n89\nmillion of other related charges represented reserves established for receivables and other current assets and the write-down of inventories impacted by the adverse economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nSubsequently, the Company released a portion of the previously established reserves due to the collection of certain trade receivables and recorded recoveries due to the realization of certain previously written-down inventories, resulting in recognition of income of $\n63\nmillion within Impairment and other related charges, net.\nThe Company continues to consider actions to exit Russia, including a possible sale of its Russian business or controlled withdrawal from the Russia market.\nDuring both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net sales in Russia represented approximately\n1\n% of PPG net sales.\nBusinesses Classified as Held for Sale\nThe Company recorded impairment charges of $\n14\nmillion, $\n21\nmillion and $\n52\nmillion in Impairment and other related charges, net in the consolidated statement of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to certain smaller, non-strategic businesses. PPG committed to plans to sell these business and they were reclassified as held for sale. The revenue of these businesses represents less than\n1\n% of PPG annual net sales. The impairment charges recorded represent the excess net book value of the net assets over the anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell.\n8.\nBusiness Restructuring\nThe Company records restructuring liabilities that represent charges incurred in connection with consolidations of certain operations, including operations from acquisitions, as well as headcount reduction programs. These charges consist primarily of severance costs and certain other cash costs. As a result of these programs, the Company will also incur incremental non-cash accelerated depreciation expense for certain assets due to their reduced expected asset life. These charges are not allocated to the Company’s reportable business segments. Refer to Note 21, “Reportable Business Segment Information” for additional information.\nIn the third quarter 2022, the Company approved a business restructuring plan which included actions to reduce its global cost structure in response to current economic conditions, including softening demand in Europe and lower than expected demand recovery in China. The Company performed a comprehensive evaluation to identify opportunities to reduce costs and improve the profitability of the overall business portfolio. The program includes actions to right-size employee headcount, reductions in functional and administrative costs and other cost savings actions. The majority of these restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2023.\nIn the fourth quarter 2021, the Company approved business restructuring actions related to recent acquisitions targeting further consolidation of its manufacturing footprint and headcount reductions. The majority of these restructuring actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2023.\nIn the second quarter 2020, the Company approved a business restructuring plan which included actions to reduce its global cost structure. The program addressed weakened global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic and related pace of recovery in a few end-use markets along with further opportunities to optimize supply chain and functional costs. In the second quarter 2019, the Company approved a business restructuring plan which included actions to reduce its global cost structure. Substantially all actions of the 2020 and 2019 restructuring programs have been completed.\nThe following table summarizes restructuring reserve activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(a)\nCertain releases\nwere recorded to reflect the current estimate of costs to complete planned business restructuring actions.\n9.\nLeases\nPPG leases certain retail paint stores, warehouses, distribution facilities, office space, fleet vehicles and equipment.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      44\nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nTotal operating lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is inclusive of the following:\nThe lease amounts included in\nthe consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(1)\nNet of accumulated depreciation of $\n14\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nLease terms and discount rates as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      45\nAs of December 31, 2022, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\n10.\nBorrowings and Lines of Credit\nLong-term Debt Obligations\n(1)\nIn February 2018, PPG entered into interest rate swaps which converted $\n150\nmillion of the notes from a fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate based on the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

These notes were issued pursuant to PPG’s existing shelf registration statement and pursuant to the Indenture between the Company and the Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented (the \"2021 Indenture\"). The 2021 Indenture governing these notes contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets.

The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the 2021 Indenture. The aggregate cash proceeds from the notes, net of discounts and fees, was $\n692\nmillion.\nIn February 2021, PPG entered into a $\n2.0\nbillion Term Loan Credit Agreement (the \"Term Loan Credit Agreement\"). The Term Loan Credit Agreement provided the Company with the ability to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $\n2.0\nbillion on an unsecured basis prior to December 31, 2021, to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains covenants that are usual and customary restrictive covenants for facilities of its type, which include, with specified exceptions, limitations on the Company’s ability to create liens or other encumbrances, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions and to enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of its assets. The Term Loan Credit Agreement matures and all outstanding borrowings are due and payable on the third anniversary of the date of the initial borrowing under the Agreement. In June 2021, PPG borrowed $\n700\nmillion under Term Loan Credit Agreement to finance the Company’s acquisition of Tikkurila, and to pay fees, costs and expenses related thereto. In December 2021, PPG borrowed an additional $\n700\nmillion under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. In 2022, PPG repaid $\n300\nmillion of the Term Loan Credit Agreement using cash on hand.

These notes were issued as additional notes pursuant to PPG’s existing shelf registration statement and pursuant to the Indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented (the \"2018 Indenture\"), which is the same Indenture pursuant to which we previously issued $\n700\nmillion in aggregate principle amount of our\n3.75\n% notes due March 2028 on February 27, 2018. The new notes will be treated as a single series of notes with the existing notes under the 2018 Indenture, have the same CUSIP number as the existing notes, and be fungible with the existing notes for US federal income tax purposes. The Indenture governing these notes contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of these notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the 2018 Indenture) at a price equal to\n101\n% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the 2018 Indenture.

These notes were issued pursuant to PPG’s existing shelf registration statement and pursuant to an indenture between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, as supplemented (the \"2020 Indenture\"). The 2020 Indenture governing these notes contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions, and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all the Company’s assets. The terms of these notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the 2020 Indenture) at a price equal to\n101\n% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may issue additional debt from time to time pursuant to the 2020 Indenture. The aggregate cash proceeds from the notes, net of discounts and fees, was $\n296\nmillion.\nIn April 2020, PPG entered into a $\n1.5\nbillion\n364\n-Day Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan”). The Term Loan contained covenants that are consistent with those in the Credit Agreement discussed below and that are usual and customary restrictive covenants for facilities of its type, which include, with specified exceptions, limitations on the Company’s ability to create liens or other encumbrances, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions and to enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of its assets. In 2020, PPG repaid $\n1.1\nbillion of the Term Loan using cash on hand. In the first quarter 2021, PPG repaid the remaining $\n400\nmillion of the Term Loan using cash on hand. The Term Loan terminated on April 13, 2021.\nCredit agreements\nIn August 2019, PPG amended and restated its\nfive\n-year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with several banks and financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for a $\n2.2\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $\n750\nmillion, subject to the receipt of lender commitments and other conditions precedent. The Credit Agreement will terminate on August 30, 2024. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement. In March 2020, PPG borrowed $\n800\nmillion under the Credit Agreement and repaid that amount in full in April 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were\nno\namounts outstanding under the credit agreement. The indicative borrowing rate on a one month, U.S. dollar denominated borrowing was\n4.4\n% at December 31, 2022.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars or in euros. The Credit Agreement provides that loans will bear interest at rates based, at the Company’s option, on one of two specified base rates plus a margin based on certain formulas defined in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains a Commitment Fee, as defined in the Credit Agreement, on the amount of unused commitments under the Credit Agreement ranging from\n0.060\n% to\n0.125\n% per annum.\nThe Credit Agreement also supports the Company’s commercial paper borrowings which are classified as long-term based on PPG’s intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis.  There were\nno\ncommercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022. There were $\n440\nmillion commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Credit Agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants for facilities of its type, which include, with specified exceptions, limitations on the Company’s ability to create liens or other encumbrances, to enter into sale and leaseback transactions and to enter into consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of its assets. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain a ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of\n60\n% or less; provided, that for any fiscal quarter in which the Company has made an acquisition for consideration in excess of $\n1\nbillion and for the next five fiscal quarters thereafter, the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization may not exceed\n65\n% at any time. As of December 31, 2022, Total Indebtedness to Total Capitalization as defined under the Credit Agreement was\n49\n%.\nThe Credit Agreement contains, among other things, customary events of default that would permit the lenders to accelerate the loans, including the failure to make timely payments when due under the Credit Agreement or other material indebtedness, the failure to satisfy covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, a change in control of the Company and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      48\nRestrictive Covenants and Cross-Default Provisions\nAs of December 31, 2022, PPG was in full compliance with the restrictive covenants under its various credit agreements, loan agreements and indentures.\nAdditionally, the Company’s Credit Agreement contains customary cross-default provisions. These provisions provide that a default on a debt service payment of $\n50\nmillion or more for longer than the grace period provided under another agreement may result in an event of default under this agreement. None of the Company’s primary debt obligations are secured or guaranteed by the Company’s affiliates.\nLong-term Debt Maturities\nShort-term Debt Obligations\nLines of Credit, Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds\nPPG’s non-U.S. operations have uncommitted lines of credit totaling $\n539\nmillion of which $\n4\nmillion was used as of December 31, 2022. These uncommitted lines of credit are subject to cancellation at any time and are generally not subject to any commitment fees.\nThe Company had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $\n231\nmillion and $\n173\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The letters of credit secure the Company’s performance to third parties under certain self-insurance programs and other commitments made in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe any loss related to these letters of credit or surety bonds is likely.\n11.\nFinancial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements\nFinancial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash held in escrow, marketable equity securities, accounts receivable, company-owned life insurance, accounts payable, short-term and long-term debt instruments, and derivatives. The fair values of these financial instruments approximated their carrying values at December 31, 2022 and 2021, in the aggregate, except for long-term debt instruments.\nHedging Activities\nThe Company has exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. As a result, financial instruments, including derivatives, have been used to hedge a portion of these underlying economic exposures. Certain of these instruments qualify as fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges upon meeting the requisite criteria, including effectiveness of offsetting hedged or underlying exposures. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in Income before income taxes in the period incurred.\nPPG’s policies do not permit speculative use of derivative financial instruments. PPG enters into derivative financial instruments with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions among such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. The Company did not realize a credit loss on derivatives during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022.\nAll of PPG’s outstanding derivative instruments are subject to accelerated settlement in the event of PPG’s failure to meet its debt or payment obligations under the terms of the instruments’ contractual provisions. In addition, if the Company would be acquired and its payment obligations under its derivative instruments’ contractual arrangements are not assumed by the acquirer, or if PPG would enter into bankruptcy, receivership or reorganization proceedings, its outstanding derivative instruments would also be subject to accelerated settlement.\nIn 2022 and 2021, there were no derivative instruments de-designated or discontinued as a hedging instrument. There were no gains or losses deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet that were reclassified to Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 related to hedges of anticipated transactions that were no longer expected to occur.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      49\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps from time to time to manage its exposure to changing interest rates. When outstanding, the interest rate swaps are typically designated as fair value hedges of certain outstanding debt obligations of the Company and are recorded at fair value.\nIn February 2018, PPG entered into interest rate swaps which converted $\n525\nmillion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The swaps are designated as fair value hedges and are carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these swaps and changes in the fair value of the related debt are recorded in Interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. The fair value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of $\n20\nmillion and an asset of $\n36\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash Flow Hedges\nAt times, PPG designates certain foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the Company’s exposure to variability in exchange rates on third party transactions denominated in foreign currencies. There were no outstanding cash flow hedges at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nNet Investment Hedges\nPPG uses cross currency swaps and foreign currency euro-denominated debt to hedge a significant portion of its net investment in its European operations, as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, PPG had U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with total notional amounts of $\n775\nmillion and designated these contracts as hedges of the Company's net investment in its European operations. During the term of these contracts, PPG will receive payment in U.S. dollars and make payments in euros to the counterparties. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of these contracts were net assets of $\n88\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, PPG had designated €\n2.5\nbillion and €\n1.4\nbillion, respectively, of euro-denominated borrowings as hedges of a portion of its net investment in the Company’s European operations. The carrying value of these instruments at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n2.6\nbillion and $\n1.6\nbillion, respectively.\nThere were no foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges used or outstanding as of and for the periods ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nOther Financial Instruments\nPPG uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage net transaction exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore, the change in the fair value of these instruments is recorded in Other (income)/charges, net in the consolidated statement of income in the period of change. Underlying notional amounts related to these foreign currency forward contracts were $\n1.8\nbillion and $\n1.9\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The fair values of these contracts was a net asset of\n$\n24\nmillion a\ns of both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nGains/Losses Deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accumulated pretax unrealized translation gains in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet related to the euro-denominated borrowings, foreign currency forward contracts, and the cross currency swaps of $\n327\nmillion and $\n204\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the amount of gains/(losses) deferred in Other comprehensive (loss)/income (\"OCI\") and the amount and location of gains recognized within the consolidated statement of income related to derivative and debt financial instruments for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. All dollar amounts are shown on a pretax basis.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      50\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows a fair value measurement hierarchy to measure its assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were cash equivalents, equity securities and derivatives. In addition, the Company measures its pension plan assets at fair value (see Note 14, “Employee Benefit Plans” for further details). The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the following three levels:\nLevel 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 inputs are considered to be the most reliable evidence of fair value as they are based on unadjusted quoted market prices from various financial information service providers and securities exchanges.\nLevel 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable prices that are not quoted on active exchanges, which include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. The fair values of the derivative instruments reflect the instruments’ contractual terms, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including forward curves.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs employed for measuring the fair value of assets or liabilities. The Company does not have any recurring financial assets or liabilities that are recorded in its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 that are classified as Level 3 inputs.\nAssets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis\n(a)    Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\n(b)    Net investment hedges\n(c)    Fair value hedges\nLong-Term Debt\n(a)    Excluding finance lease obligations of $\n10\nmillion and short term borrowings of $\n10\nmillion as of December 31, 2022.\n(b)    Excluding finance lease obligations of $\n10\nmillion and short term borrowings of $\n6\nmillion as of December 31, 2021.\nThe fair values of the debt instruments were measured using Level 2 inputs, including discounted cash flows and interest rates then currently available to the Company for instruments of the same remaining maturities.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      51\n12.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nExcluded from the computation of earnings per diluted share due to their antidilutive effect were\n0.9\nmillion,\nzero\n, and\n1.4\nmillion outstanding stock options in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant components consisted of the following:\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. corporate federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate follows:\nThe effective tax rate for the year-ended December 31, 2022 was\n23.5\n%, an increase of\n2.9\n% from the prior year primarily driven by charges associated with PPG’s operations in Russia along with a reduction in the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions compared to the prior year.\nIncome before income taxes of the Company’s U.S. operations for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n288\nmillion, $\n469\nmillion and $\n190\nmillion, respectively. Income before income taxes of the Company’s foreign operations for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n1,093\nmillion, $\n1,346\nmillion and $\n1,172\nmillion, respectively.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      52\nDeferred income taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences that arise because there are certain items treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the enacted tax rate in the year in which the temporary difference is expected to reverse.\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards\nA valuation allowance of $\n182\nmillion and $\n172\nmillion has been established for carry-forwards and certain other items at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, when the ability to utilize them is not likely.\nUndistributed foreign earnings\nThe Company had $\n4.6\nbillion of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022. This amount relates to approximately\n280\nsubsidiaries in approximately\n80\ntaxable jurisdictions. The Company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 would result in a tax cost o\nf $\n101\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had not changed its intention to reinvest foreign earnings indefinitely or repatriate when it is tax effective to do so, and as such, has not established a liability for foreign withholding taxes or other costs that would be incurred if the earnings were repatriated.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nThe Company files federal, state and local income tax returns in numerous domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In most tax jurisdictions, returns are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities for a number of years after the returns have been filed. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities in any major tax jurisdiction for years before 2008. Additionally, the Company is no longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for U.S. federal income tax returns filed for years through 2016. The examinations of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2017 and 2018 are currently underway.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      53\nA reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) as of December 31 follows:\nThe Company expects that any reasonably possible change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months would not be significant. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $\n120\nmillion as of December 31, 2022.\nInterest and penalties\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\n14.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nPPG has defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees worldwide. The principal defined benefit pension plans are those in the U.S., Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. These plans in the aggregate represent approximately\n95\n% of PPG’s total projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2022, of which the U.S. defined benefit pension plans represent the largest component.\nAs of January 1, 2006, the Company’s U.S. salaried defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants. In 2011 and 2012, the Company approved amendments related to its U.S. and Canadian defined benefit plans pursuant to which employees stopped accruing benefits at certain dates based on the affected employee’s combined age and years of service to PPG. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s U.S. and Canadian defined benefit plans were frozen for all participants. The Company plans to continue reviewing and potentially amending PPG defined benefit plans in the future.\nCanadian pension annuity contracts\nIn December 2021, the Company purchased group annuity contracts that transferred pension benefit obligations for certain of the Company’s retirees in Canada who were receiving their monthly retirement benefit payments from PPG’s Canadian pension plans to a third-party insurance company. The amount of each affected retiree’s annuity payment is equal to the amount of such individual’s pension benefit. The purchase of group annuity contracts was funded directly by the assets of the Canadian plans. By transferring the obligations and assets to the insurance company, the Company reduced its overall pension projected benefit obligation by approximately $\n175\nmillion and recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of $\n50\nmillion in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nPostretirement medical\nPPG sponsors welfare benefit plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain U.S. and Canadian employees and their dependents of which the U.S. welfare benefit plans represent approximately\n87\n% of PPG’s total projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2022. Salaried and certain hourly employees in the U.S. hired on or after October 1, 2004, or rehired on or after October 1, 2012 are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits. These plans in the U.S. and Canada require retiree contributions based on retiree-selected coverage levels for certain retirees and their dependents and provide for sharing of future benefit cost increases between PPG and participants based on management discretion. The Company has the right to modify, amend or terminate certain of these benefit plans in the future.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company-sponsored Medicare-eligible plans were replaced by a Medicare private exchange. The announcement of this plan design change triggered a remeasurement of PPG’s retiree medical benefit obligation using prevailing interest rates. The plan design change resulted in a $\n306\nmillion reduction in the Company's postretirement benefit obligation. PPG accounted for the plan design change prospectively, and the impact was amortized to periodic postretirement benefit cost over a\n5.6\nyear period through mid-2022.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      54\nThe following table sets forth the changes in projected benefit obligations (“PBO”), plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans:\nThe PBO is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future pay increases. The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, but does not include the effects of estimated future pay increases. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n2.3\nbillion and $\n3.5\nbillion, respectively.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      55\nThe following table details the pension plans where the benefit liability exceeds the fair value of the plan assets:\nNet actuarial losses/(gains) and prior service cost/(credit) deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss\nThe accumulated net actuarial losses (gains) for pensions and other postretirement benefits relate primarily to historical changes in the discount rates. The accumulated net actuarial losses exceeded 10% of the higher of the market value of plan assets or the PBO at the beginning of each of the last three years; therefore, amortization of such excess has been included in net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits in these periods. The amortization period is the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits unless a plan is mostly inactive in which case the amortization period is the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. Accumulated prior service cost (credit) is amortized over the future service periods of those employees who are active at the dates of the plan amendments and who are expected to receive benefits.\nThe net decrease in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (pretax) in 2022 relating to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits is primarily attributable to pension and other postretirement plan discount rate increases, as follows:\nThe 2022 net actuarial gain related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2022.\nNet periodic benefit (income)/cost\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      56\nService cost for net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs is included in Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, Selling, general and administrative, and Research and development, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Except for the Canadian pension settlement charge in 2021, all other components of net periodic benefit cost are recorded in Other (income)/charges, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nKey assumptions\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligation for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022:\nThese assumptions for each plan are reviewed on an annual basis. In determining the expected return on plan asset assumption, the Company evaluates the mix of investments that comprise each plan’s assets and external forecasts of future long-term investment returns. The Company compares the expected return on plan assets assumption to actual historic returns to ensure reasonability. For 2022, the return on plan assets assumption for PPG’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans was\n7.4\n%. A change in the rate of return of 75 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2023 net periodic pension expense by $\n8\nmillion. The global expected return on plan assets assumption to be used in determining 2023 net periodic pension expense will be\n6.5\n% (\n7.4\n% for the U.S. plans only).\nThe discount rates used in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using a yield curve constructed of high-quality fixed-income securities as of the measurement date and using the plans’ projected benefit payments. The Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost (income) for countries with significant pension plans. The full yield curve approach (also known as the split-rate or spot-rate method) allows the Company to align the applicable discount rates with the cost of additional service being earned and the interest being accrued on these obligations. A change in the discount rate of 75 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact 2023 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by $\n5\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively.\nThe weighted-average health care cost trend rate (inflation) used for 2022 was\n5.4\n% declining to a projected\n4.0\n% in the year 2046. For 2023, the assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate used will be\n5.8\n% declining to a projected\n3.9\n% between 2023 and 2047 for medical and prescription drug costs, respectively. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis. In selecting rates for current and long-term health care cost assumptions, the Company takes into consideration a number of factors, including the Company’s actual health care cost increases, the design of the Company’s benefit programs, the demographics of the Company’s active and retiree populations and external expectations of future medical cost inflation rates.\nContributions to defined benefit pension plans\nContributions made to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were required by local funding requirements. PPG expects to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the range of $\n10\nmillion to $\n20\nmillion in 2023. PPG may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2023 and beyond.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      57\nBenefit payments\nThe estimated benefits expected to be paid under the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are:\nPlan assets\nEach PPG sponsored defined benefit pension plan is managed in accordance with the requirements of local laws and regulations governing defined benefit pension plans for the exclusive purpose of providing pension benefits to participants and their beneficiaries. Investment committees comprised of PPG managers have fiduciary responsibility to oversee the management of pension plan assets by third party asset managers. Pension plan assets are held in trust by financial institutions and managed on a day-to-day basis by the asset managers. The asset managers receive a mandate from each investment committee that is aligned with the asset allocation targets established by each investment committee to achieve the plan’s investment strategies. The performance of the asset managers is monitored and evaluated by the investment committees throughout the year.\nPension plan assets are invested to generate investment earnings over an extended time horizon to help fund the cost of benefits promised under the plans while mitigating investment risk. The asset allocation targets established for each pension plan are intended to diversify the investments among a variety of asset categories and among a variety of individual securities within each asset category to mitigate investment risk and provide each plan with sufficient liquidity to fund the payment of pension benefits to retirees.\nThe following summarizes the weighted average target pension plan asset allocation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 for all PPG defined benefit plans:\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      58\nThe fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset category, are as follows:\n(1)\nThese levels refer to the accounting guidance on fair value measurement described in Note 11, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements.”\n(2)\nThese amounts represent holdings in investment grade debt or equity securities of issuers in both developed markets and emerging economies.\n(3)\nThis category represents investment grade debt securities from a diverse set of industry issuers.\n(4)\nThese investments are primarily long duration fixed income securities.\n(5)\nThis category represents commingled funds invested in diverse portfolios of debt securities.\n(6)\nThis category includes mortgage-backed and asset backed debt securities, municipal bonds and other debt securities including derivatives.\n(7)\nCertain investments that are measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe change in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 pension assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:\nReal estate properties are externally appraised at least annually by reputable, independent appraisal firms. Property valuations are also reviewed on a regular basis and are adjusted if there has been a significant change in circumstances related to the property since the last valuation.\nOther debt securities consist of insurance contracts, which are valued externally by insurance companies based on the present value of the expected future cash flows.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      59\nHedge funds consist of a wide range of investments which target a relatively stable investment return. The underlying funds are valued at different frequencies, some monthly and some quarterly, based on the value of the underlying investments. Other assets consist primarily of small investments in private equity funds and senior secured debt obligations of non-investment grade borrowers.\nOther Plans\nEmployee savings plans\nPPG’s Employee Savings Plans (“Savings Plans”) cover substantially all employees in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. The Company makes matching contributions to the Savings Plans, at management’s discretion, based upon participants’ savings, subject to certain limitations. For most participants, Company-matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the Company and are applied to participant accounts up to a maximum of\n6\n% of eligible participant compensation. The Company-matching contribution remained at\n100\n% for 2022.\nCompensation expense and cash contributions related to the Company match of participant contributions to the Savings Plans for 2022, 2021, and 2020 totaled $\n56\nmillion, $\n52\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion, respectively. A portion of the Savings Plans qualifies under the Internal Revenue Code as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Accordingly, dividends received on PPG shares held in that portion of the Savings Plans totaling $\n11\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion, and $\n11\nmillion for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, are deductible for PPG’s U.S. Federal tax purposes.\nDefined contribution plans\nAdditionally, the Company has defined contribution plans for certain employees in the U.S., China, United Kingdom, Australia, Italy and other countries. The U.S. defined contribution plan is part of the Employee Savings Plan, and eligible employees receive a contribution equal to between 2% and 5% of annual compensation, based on age and years of service. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized expense for its defined contribution retirement plans of $\n92\nmillion, $\n88\nmillion and $\n64\nmillion, respectively. The Company’s annual cash contributions to its defined contribution retirement plans approximated the expense recognized in each year.\nDeferred compensation plan\nThe Company has a deferred compensation plan for certain key managers which allows them to defer a portion of their compensation in a phantom PPG stock account or other phantom investment accounts. The amount deferred earns a return based on the investment options selected by the participant. The amount owed to participants is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation of the Company. Upon retirement, death, disability, termination of employment, scheduled payment or unforeseen emergency, the compensation deferred and related accumulated earnings are distributed in accordance with the participant’s election in cash or in PPG stock, based on the accounts selected by the participant.\nThe plan provides participants with investment alternatives and the ability to transfer amounts between the phantom non-PPG stock investment accounts. To mitigate the impact on compensation expense of changes in the market value of the liability, the Company has purchased a portfolio of marketable securities that mirror the phantom non-PPG stock investment accounts selected by the participants, except the money market accounts. These investments are carried by PPG at fair market value, and the changes in market value of these securities are also included in Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. Trading occurs in this portfolio to align the securities held with the participant’s phantom non-PPG stock investment accounts, except the money market accounts.\nThe cost of the deferred compensation plan, comprised of dividend equivalents accrued on the phantom PPG stock account, investment income and the change in market value of the liability, was $\n23\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are included in Selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income. The change in market value of the investment portfolio was income of $\n24\nmillion, $\n18\nmillion, and $\n24\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is also included in Selling, general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company’s obligations under this plan, which are included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, totaled $\n105\nmillion and $\n139\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the investments in marketable securities, which are included in Investments and Other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, were $\n70\nmillion and $\n104\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n15.\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\nPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. These lawsuits and claims may relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, antitrust, employment and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. To the extent that these lawsuits and claims involve personal injury, property damage and certain other claims, PPG believes it has adequate insurance; however, certain of PPG’s insurers are contesting coverage with\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      60\nrespect to some of these claims, and other insurers may contest coverage with respect to some claims in the future. PPG’s lawsuits and claims against others include claims against insurers and other third parties with respect to actual and contingent losses related to environmental, asbestos and other matters.\nThe results of any current or future litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. However, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.\nAsbestos Matters\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company was aware of certain asbestos-related claims pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Company is defending these asbestos-related claims vigorously. The asbestos-related claims consist of claims against the Company alleging:\n•\nexposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold or distributed by the Company or its subsidiaries (“Products Claims”);\n•\npersonal injury caused by asbestos on premises presently or formerly owned, leased or occupied by the Company (“Premises Claims”); and\n•\nasbestos-related claims against a subsidiary the Company acquired in 2013 (“Subsidiary Claims”).\nThe Company monitors and reviews the activity associated with its asbestos claims and evaluates, on a periodic basis, its estimated liability for such claims and all underlying assumptions to determine whether any adjustment to the reserves for these claims is required. Additionally, as a supplement to its periodic monitoring and review, the Company conducts discussions with counsel and engages valuation consultants to analyze its claims history and estimate the amount of the Company’s potential liability for asbestos-related claims.\nIn 2022, no adjustments to the Company’s estimate of its asbestos-related liabilities were required.\nIn 2021, based on the results of the Company’s valuation analysis, the Company reduced its estimate of potential liability for Products Claims by $\n146\nmillion. The 2021 valuation analysis with respect to Products Claims was based, in part, upon a review of claims data following the expiration in May 2016 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court’s injunction staying most asbestos claims against the Company that had been in effect since April 2000; annual filings by disease and year; pending, paid and dismissed claims; indemnity cash flows; and estimates of future claim, indemnity and acceptance rates. The Company also adjusted its estimates of potential liability for Premises Claims and Subsidiary Claims in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAs a result of the Company’s 2021 review of its asbestos-related liabilities, income of $\n133\nmillion was recorded in the consolidated statement of income to reduce the reserve to reflect the Company’s current estimate of potential liability for asbestos-related bodily injury claims through December 31, 2057.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s asbestos-related reserves totaled $\n51\nmillion and $\n54\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company believes that, based on presently available information, the total reserves of $\n51\nmillion for asbestos-related claims will be sufficient to encompass all of the Company’s current and estimable potential future asbestos liabilities. These reserves, which are included within Other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, involve significant management judgment and represent the Company’s current best estimate of its liability for these claims.\nThe amount reserved for asbestos-related claims by its nature is subject to many uncertainties that may change over time, including (i) the ultimate number of claims filed; (ii) whether closed, dismissed or dormant claims are reinstituted, reinstated or revived; (iii) the amounts required to resolve both currently known and future unknown claims; (iv) the amount of insurance, if any, available to cover such claims; (v) the unpredictable aspects of the tort system, including a changing trial docket and the jurisdictions in which trials are scheduled; (vi) the outcome of any trials, including potential judgments or jury verdicts; (vii) the lack of specific information in many cases concerning exposure for which the Company is allegedly responsible, and the claimants’ alleged diseases resulting from such exposure; and (viii) potential changes in applicable federal and/or state tort liability law. All of these factors may have a material effect upon future asbestos-related liability estimates. While the ultimate outcome of the Company’s asbestos litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that any financial exposure resulting from its asbestos-related claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nEnvironmental Matters\nIn management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      61\noutcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.\nAs remediation at certain environmental sites progresses, PPG continues to refine its assumptions underlying the estimates of the expected future costs of its remediation programs. PPG’s ongoing evaluation may result in additional charges against income to adjust the reserves for these sites. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, certain charges have been recorded based on updated estimates to increase existing reserves for these sites. Certain other charges related to environmental remediation actions are expensed as incurred.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies associated with PPG’s former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, New Jersey (“New Jersey Chrome”), glass and chemical manufacturing sites, and for other environmental contingencies, including current manufacturing locations and National Priority List sites. These reserves are reported as Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nPretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs are included in Other (income)/charges, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.\nThe pretax charges and cash outlays related to such environmental remediation in 2022, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:\nIn the fourth quarter 2021, PPG released an environmental reserve previously established at the time of the sale of the flat glass business under the terms of the separation agreement, resulting in recognition of $\n25\nmillion of income from discontinued operations, or $\n19\nmillion net of tax.\nThe Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with New Jersey Chrome as further discussed below. Excluding the charges related to New Jersey Chrome, pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between approximately $\n5\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion per year for the past\n10\nyears.\nManagement expects cash outlays for environmental remediation costs to range from $\n40\nmillion to $\n60\nmillion in 2023, and $\n20\nmillion to $\n75\nmillion annually from 2024 through 2027.\nActual future cash outlays may vary from expected future cash outlays and actual future costs may vary from accrued estimates due to the inherent uncertainties involved in estimating future environmental remediation costs, including possible technological, regulatory and enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies and other factors. Specifically, the level of expected future remediation costs and cash outlays is highly dependent upon activity related to New Jersey Chrome as discussed below.\nRemediation: New Jersey Chrome\nIn June 2009, PPG entered into a settlement agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) and Jersey City, New Jersey (which had asserted claims against PPG for lost tax revenue) which was in the form of a Judicial Consent Order (the \"JCO\"). Under the JCO, PPG accepted sole responsibility for the remediation activities at its former chromium manufacturing location in Jersey City and a number of additional surrounding sites. Remediation of the New Jersey Chrome sites requires PPG to remediate soil and groundwater contaminated by hexavalent chromium, as well as perform certain other environmental remediation activities. The most significant assumptions underlying the estimate of remediation costs for all New Jersey Chrome sites relate to the extent and concentration of chromium in the soil.\nPPG regularly evaluates the assessments of costs incurred to date versus current progress and the potential cost impacts of the most recent information, including the extent of impacted soils, percentage of hazardous versus non-hazardous soils, daily soil excavation rates, and engineering, administrative and other associated costs. Based on these\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      62\nassessments, the reserve is adjusted accordingly. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, PPG’s reserve for remediation of all New Jersey Chrome sites was $\n58\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion, respectively. The major cost components of this liability are related to excavation of impacted soil, as well as groundwater remediation. These components each account for approximately\n65\n% and\n15\n% of the amount accrued at December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThere are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites. Further resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years. As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will continue to be adjusted.\nRemediation: Glass, Chemicals and Other Sites\nAmong other sites at which PPG is managing environmental liabilities, remedial actions are occurring at a chemical manufacturing site in Barberton, Ohio where PPG has completed a Facility Investigation and Corrective Measure Study under the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program. PPG has also been addressing the impacts from a legacy plate glass manufacturing site in Kokomo, Indiana under the Voluntary Remediation Program of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and a site associated with a legacy plate glass manufacturing site near Ford City, Pennsylvania under the Pennsylvania Land Recycling Program under the oversight of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. PPG is currently performing additional investigation and remedial activities at these locations.\nWith respect to certain other waste sites, the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties also contributes to the uncertainty of estimating PPG’s final costs. Although contributors of waste to sites involving other potentially responsible parties may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability, in general, final allocations of costs are made based on the relative contributions of wastes to such sites. PPG is generally not a major contributor to such sites.\nRemediation: Reasonably Possible Matters\nIn addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as $\n100\nmillion to $\n200\nmillion. Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.\nThe impact of evolving programs, such as natural resource damage claims, industrial site re-use initiatives and domestic and international remediation programs, also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss. The Company’s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex, ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation, if necessary, of such environmental contingencies, and the potential for technological and regulatory developments.\n16.\nShareholders' Equity\nA class of\n10\nmillion shares of preferred stock, without par value, is authorized but unissued. Common stock has a par value of $1.66\n2\n/\n3\nper share;\n1.2\nbillion shares are authorized.\nPer share cash dividends paid were $\n2.42\n, $\n2.26\nand $\n2.10\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      63\n17.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL)\n(1)\nThe tax cost/(benefit) related to unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments on net investment hedges as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n73\nmillion, $\n55\nmillion and $(\n6\n) million, respectively.\n(2)\nThe tax cost/(benefit) related to the adjustment for pension and other postretirement benefits as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n83\nmillion, $\n48\nmillion and $(\n70\n) million, respectively. Reclassifications from AOCL are included in the computation of net periodic benefit costs (see Note 14, “Employee Benefit Plans\").\n18.\nOther (Income)/Charges, Net\n(1)\nIn 2021, PPG recognized a $\n34\nmillion gain on the sale of a production facility in connection with the Company’s manufacturing footprint consolidation plans and associated restructuring programs.\n19.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company’s stock-based compensation includes stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and grants of contingent shares that are earned based on achieving targeted levels of total shareholder return. All current grants of stock options, RSUs and contingent shares are made under the PPG Industries, Inc. Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (“PPG Amended Omnibus Plan”), which was amended and restated effective April 21, 2016.\nStock Options\nPPG has outstanding stock option awards that have been granted under the PPG Amended Omnibus Plan. Under the PPG Amended Omnibus Plan, certain employees of the Company have been granted options to purchase shares of common stock at prices equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date the options were granted. The options are generally exercisable\n36\nmonths after being granted and have a maximum term of\n10\nyears. Upon exercise of a stock option, shares of Company stock are issued from treasury stock.\nThe fair value of stock options issued to employees is measured on the date of grant and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. PPG estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The risk-free interest rate is determined by using the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the date of the grant and using a maturity equal to the expected life of the option. The expected life of options is calculated using the average of the vesting term and the maximum term, as prescribed by accounting guidance on the use of the simplified method for determining the expected term of an employee share option. The expected dividend yield and volatility are based on historical stock prices and dividend amounts over past time periods equal in length to the expected life of the options. PPG applies an estimated forfeiture rate that is calculated based on historical activity.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      64\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used to calculate the fair values of stock option grants in each year:\nThe weighted average fair value of options granted was $\n36.52\nper share, $\n29.27\nper share and $\n21.93\nper share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022, unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options that have not yet vested totaled $\n7\nmillion. This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of\n1.4\nyears.\nThe following table presents stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nRestricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)\nLong-term incentive value is delivered to selected key management employees by granting RSUs, which have either time or performance-based vesting features. The fair value of an RSU is equal to the market value of a share of PPG common stock on the date of grant. Time-based RSUs generally vest over the\nthree\n-year period following the date of grant, unless forfeited, and will be paid out in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both at the Company’s discretion at the end of the\nthree\nyear vesting period. Performance-based RSUs vest based on achieving specific annual performance targets for earnings per share growth and cash flow return on capital over the\nthree\ncalendar year-end periods following the date of grant. Unless forfeited, the performance-based RSUs will be paid out in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both at the Company’s discretion at the end of the\nthree\n-year performance period if PPG meets the performance targets.\nThe amount paid upon vesting of performance-based RSUs may range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the original grant, based upon the level of earnings per share growth achieved and frequency with which the annual cash flow return on capital performance target is met over the\nthree\ncalendar year periods comprising the vesting period. Performance against the earnings per share growth and the cash flow return on capital goal is calculated annually, and the annual payout for each goal will be weighted equally over the three-year period. The performance-based RSUs granted in 2020 vested at\n100\n%. PPG has assumed that performance-based RSUs granted in 2021 and 2022 will both vest at the\n100\n% level.\nThere was $\n20\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2022. This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of\n1.5\nyears.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      65\nContingent Share Grants\nThe Company also provides grants of contingent shares to selected key executives that may be earned based on PPG’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over the\nthree\n-year period following the date of grant. Contingent share grants (referred to as “TSR awards”) are made annually and are paid out at the end of each\nthree\n-year period based on the Company’s performance. Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of PPG common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 for the\nthree\n-year period following the date of grant. This comparison group represents the entire S&P 500 Index as it existed at the beginning of the performance period, excluding any companies that have been removed from the index because they ceased to be publicly traded. The payout is based on performance achieved during the three-year period calculated in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the initial grant. A payout of\n100\n% is earned if the target performance is achieved. Contingent share awards earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants or credited to the participants’ deferred compensation plan accounts with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of contingent shares earned. Any payments made at the end of the award period may be in the form of stock, cash or a combination of both. The TSR awards are classified as liability awards, and compensation expense is recognized over the\nthree\n-year award period based on the fair value of the awards (giving consideration to the Company’s percentile rank of total shareholder return) remeasured in each reporting period until settlement of the awards.\nThe performance period for the TSR shares granted in 2020 ended on December 31, 2022, and PPG’s total shareholder return was measured against that of the S&P 500 over the\nthree\n‑year period. PPG’s ranking on this performance measure was at the 28th percentile, resulting in\nno\npayout.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $\n2\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding TSR awards based on the current estimate of fair value. This cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of\n2.0\nyears.\n20.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer and in amounts that the Company expects to collect. The timing of revenue recognition takes into consideration the various shipping terms applicable to the Company’s sales. For most transactions, control passes in accordance with agreed upon delivery terms.\nThe Company delivers products to company-owned stores, home centers and other regional or national consumer retail outlets, paint dealers, concessionaires and independent distributors, company-owned distribution networks, and directly to manufacturing companies and retail customers. Each product delivered to a third party customer is considered to satisfy a performance obligation. Performance obligations generally occur at a point in time and are satisfied when control of the goods passes to the customer. The Company is entitled to collection of the sales price under normal credit terms in the regions in which it operates. Accounts receivable are recognized when there is an unconditional right to consideration. Payment terms vary from customer to customer, depending on creditworthiness, prior payment history and other considerations.\nThe Company also provides services by applying coatings to customers' manufactured parts and assembled products and by providing technical support to certain customers. Performance obligations are satisfied over time as critical milestones are met and as services are provided. PPG is entitled to payment as the services are rendered. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, service revenue constituted less than\n5\n% of total revenue.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      66\nNet sales by segment and region for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(1)\nNet sales to external customers are attributed to geographic regions based upon the location of the operating unit shipping the product.\n(2)\nNet sales recognized in the United States represented\n38\n%,\n36\n%, and\n37\n% of the Company’s total Net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAll trade receivables are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at the outstanding principal amount adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts and any charge-offs. PPG provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value equal to the amount that is expected to be collected. This allowance is estimated based on historical collection experience, current regional economic and market conditions, the aging of accounts receivable, assessments of current creditworthiness of customers and forward-looking information. The use of forward-looking information is based on certain macroeconomic and microeconomic indicators including, but not limited to, regional business environment risk, political risk, and commercial and financing risks.\nPPG reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis to ensure the estimate reflects regional risk trends as well as current and future global operating conditions.\nThe following table summarizes allowance for doubtful accounts activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nIn the first quarter 2022, PPG recorded a bad debt reserve of $\n43\nmillion associated with the adverse economic impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Subsequently, the Company released a portion of this previously established bad debt reserve due to the collection of certain trade receivables, resulting in a bad debt reserve related to PPG's operations in Russia of $\n11\nmillion at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 7, \"Impairment and Other Related Charges, Net\" for additional information.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      67\n21.\nReportable Business Segment Information\nSegment Organization and Products\nPPG is a multinational manufacturer with\n10\noperating segments (which the Company refers to as “strategic business units”) that are organized based on the Company’s major products lines. The Company’s reportable business segments include the following\ntwo\nsegments: Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings. The operating segments have been aggregated based on economic similarities, the nature of their products, production processes, end-use markets and methods of distribution.\nThe Performance Coatings reportable business segment is comprised of the automotive refinish coatings, aerospace coatings, architectural coatings – Americas and Asia Pacific, architectural coatings – EMEA, protective and marine coatings and traffic solutions operating segments. This reportable business segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings, sealants and finishes, along with paint strippers, stains and related chemicals, pavement marking products, transparencies and transparent armor.\nThe Industrial Coatings reportable business segment is comprised of the automotive OEM coatings, industrial coatings, packaging coatings, and the specialty coatings and materials operating segments. This reportable business segment primarily supplies a variety of protective and decorative coatings and finishes along with adhesives, sealants, metal pretreatment products, optical monomers and coatings, precipitated silicas and other specialty materials.\nProduction facilities and sales for Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings are global. PPG’s reportable business segments continue to pursue opportunities to further develop their global reach. Each of the reportable business segments in which PPG is engaged is highly competitive. The diversification of our product lines and the worldwide sales tend to minimize the impact on PPG’s business of changes in demand in a particular industry or in a particular geographic area.\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”). The Company allocates resources to operating segments and evaluates the performance of operating segments based upon segment income, which is income before interest expense – net, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests and excludes certain charges which are considered to be unusual or non-recurring. The Company also evaluates performance of operating segments based on working capital reduction, selling price increases and sales volume growth.\nCorporate unallocated costs include the costs of corporate staff functions not directly associated with the operating segments, certain legal matters, net of related insurance recoveries, the cost of certain insurance and stock-based compensation programs and certain other unusual or non-recurring items. The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost related to current employees of each reportable business segment is allocated to that reportable business segment and the remaining portion of net periodic pension expense is included in the Corporate unallocated costs.\nProduct movement between Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings is limited, is accounted for as an inventory transfer, and is recorded at cost plus a mark-up, the impact of which is not significant to the net sales or segment income of the reportable business segments.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      68\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      69\n(1)\nIn the first quarter 2022, the Company recorded impairment and other related charges due to the wind down of the company’s operations in Russia. Subsequently, the Company released a portion of the previously established reserves for Receivables and Inventories due to the collection of certain trade receivables and the realization of certain inventories. Also in 2022, impairment and other related charges were recorded for the write-down of certain assets and liabilities related to the planned sale of a non-core business and for certain asset write downs. In 2021 and 2020, impairment charges were recorded for the write-down of certain assets related to the previously planned sale of certain smaller entities in non-strategic regions. Also in 2020, an impairment charge was recorded to reduce the carrying value of an indefinite-lived trademark.\n(2)\nIncluded in business restructuring-related costs, net are business restructuring charges, accelerated depreciation of certain assets and other related costs, offset by releases related to previously approved programs and a $\n34\nmillion gain on the sale of certain assets in 2021 in connection with the Company’s manufacturing footprint consolidation plans and associated restructuring programs. This gain is included in Other (income)/charges, net in the consolidated statement of income.\n(3)\nTransaction-related costs, net include advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, other professional or consulting fees, and certain internal costs directly incurred to effect acquisitions. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the statement of income. Acquisition-related costs, net also include the impact for the step up to fair value of inventory acquired in certain acquisitions which are included in Cost of Sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of income.\n(4)\nIn 2020, two hurricanes damaged a southern U.S. factory supporting the Company's specialty coatings and materials business. In early 2021, a winter storm further damaged that factory as well as other company factories in the southern U.S. Incremental expenses incurred due to these storms included costs related to maintenance and repairs of damaged property, freight and utility premiums and other incremental expenses directly related to the impacted areas.\n(5)\nIn 2021, the reserve for asbestos-related claims was reduced to reflect the Company’s current estimate of potential liability for these claims.\n(6)\nSegment assets are the total assets used in the operation of each segment. Corporate assets principally include amounts recorded in Cash and cash equivalents, Deferred income taxes, and Property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet.\n2022 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K      70"
