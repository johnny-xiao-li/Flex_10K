    "text": "DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nTyler Technologies, Inc. (“Tyler”) is a major provider of integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector. We partner with clients to make government more accessible to the public, more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its operations. We have a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology (“IT”) needs of major areas of operations for cities, counties, schools and other government entities. We offer clients delivery of our software applications through software as a service (“SaaS”) and on-premise solutions. In recent years, substantially all of the Tyler’s products are sold through subscriptions delivered as SaaS. We provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and, at times, product modifications. In addition, we are the nation’s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions. We also provide continuing client support services to ensure product performance and reliability, which provides us with long-term client relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue. We provide digital government services and payment solutions. In addition, we provide electronic document filing (“e-filing”) solutions, which simplify the filing and management of court documents.\nMARKET OVERVIEW\nThe state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized IT markets in the country, consisting of all 50 states, approximately 3,000 counties, 36,000 cities and towns and 12,900 school districts. This market is also comprised of approximately 38,000 special districts and other agencies, each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements.\nTraditionally, local government bodies and agencies performed state-mandated duties, including property assessment, record keeping, road maintenance, law enforcement, administration of election and judicial functions, and the provision of welfare assistance. Today, a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments, each of which demands a service response. These areas include criminal justice and corrections, administration and finance, public safety, health and human services, planning, regulatory and maintenance and records and document management. Transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units. In addition, constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities. As a result, local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to, among other things, improve revenue collection, provide increased access to information, and streamline delivery of services to their constituents. Local government bodies are now recognizing that “e-government” is an additional responsibility for community development. From integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems, many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdiction-wide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management. Many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements, which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office.\nMany local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their IT functions. As a result, they seek to establish long-term relationships with reliable providers of high quality IT products and services such as Tyler.\nAlthough local governments often face budgetary constraints in their operations, their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes, and to a lesser extent, utility billings and other fees, which historically tend to be relatively stable. In addition, the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently, more securely, and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services.\nGartner, Inc., a leading information technology research and advisory company, estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from $27.8 billion in 2023 to $40.0 billion in 2026. The professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from $33.5 billion in 2023 to $41.9 billion in 2026. Application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from $5.4 billion in 2023 to $6.6 billion in 2026 while professional services and support are expected to grow from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $6.1 billion in 2026. For the national and international government markets, application and vertical specific software sales is expected to expand from $42.2 billion in 2023 to $61.5 billion in 2026 while professional services and support are expected to grow from $65.6 billion in 2023 to $82.1 billion in 2026.\n3\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nWe provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities, counties, states, schools, federal agencies, and other government entities.\nWe design, develop, market and support a broad range of software solutions to serve mission-critical “back-office” functions of the public sector. Many of our software applications include Internet-accessible solutions that allow for real-time public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with governments online. Our software solutions and services are provided through seven business units, which focus on the following products:\n•\nfinancial management, education and planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;\n•\nfinancial management, municipal courts, planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;\n•\ncourts and justice and public safety software solutions;\n•\ndata and insights solutions;\n•\nappraisal and tax software solutions, land and vital records management software solutions, and property appraisal services;\n•\ndevelopment platform solutions including case management and business process management; and\n•\ndigital government and payments solutions.\nEach of our core software solutions consists of several fully integrated applications. For clients who acquire software for use on premises, we generally license our solutions under standard perpetual license agreements that provide the client with a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software. In some of the product areas, such as financial management and education and property appraisal and tax, we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments.\nWe also offer SaaS arrangements for clients who do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or to make up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. For these clients, the software and client data are hosted at our data centers or at third-party locations, and clients typically sign multi-year contracts for these subscription-based services.\nA description of our suites of products and services follows:\nFinancial Management and Education\nOur financial management and education solutions are enterprise resource planning systems for the public sector, which integrate information across all facets of a client organization. Our financial management solutions include modular fund accounting systems that can be tailored to meet the needs of virtually any government agency or not-for-profit entity. Our financial management systems include modules for general ledger, budget preparation, fixed assets, requisitions, purchase orders, bid management, accounts payable, contract management, accounts receivable, investment management, inventory control, project and grant accounting, work orders, job costing, GASB reporting, payroll and human resources. All of our financial management systems are intended to conform to government auditing and financial reporting requirements and generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe sell utility billing systems that support the billing and collection of metered and non-metered services, along with multiple billing cycles. Our Web-enabled utility billing solutions allow clients to access information online such as average consumption and transaction history. In addition, our systems can accept secured Internet payments via credit cards and checks.\nWe also offer specialized products that automate numerous city and county functions, including municipal courts, parking tickets, equipment and project costing, animal licenses, business licenses, permits and inspections, code enforcement, citizen complaint tracking, ambulance billing, fleet maintenance, and cemetery records management.\nIn addition to providing financial management systems to K-12 schools, we sell student information systems for K-12 schools, which manage such activities as scheduling, grades and attendance. We also offer student transportation solutions to manage school bus routing optimization, fleet management, field trips and other related functions.\nTyler’s financial management and education solutions include Web components that enhance governments’ service capabilities by facilitating online access to information for both employees and citizens and enabling online transactions.\nCourts and Justice\nWe offer a complete, fully integrated suite of judicial solutions designed to handle complex, multi-jurisdictional county or statewide implementations as well as single county systems. Our solutions help eliminate duplicate data entry, promote more effective business procedures, and improve efficiency across the entire justice process.\n4\nOur unified court case management system is designed to automate the tracking and management of information involved in all case types, including criminal, traffic, civil, family, probate and juvenile courts. It also tracks the status of cases, processes fines and fees and generates the specialized judgment and sentencing documents, notices and forms required in the court process. Documents received by the court can be scanned into the electronic case file and easily retrieved for viewing. Documents generated by the court can be electronically signed and automatically attached to the electronic case file. Additional modules automate the management of court calendars, coordinate judges' schedules and generate court dockets. Our targeted courtroom technologies allow courts to rapidly review calendars, cases and view documents in the courtroom. Courts may also take advantage of our related jury management system. We also offer a solution for online dispute resolution that automates the flow and resolution of common and historically time-consuming disputes including debt, landlord, tenant, small claims, child custody and other case types.\nOur court and law enforcement systems allow the public to access, via the Internet, a variety of information, including non-confidential criminal and civil court records, jail booking and release information, bond and bondsmen information, and court calendars and dockets. In addition, our systems allow cities and counties to accept payments for traffic and parking tickets over the Internet, with a seamless and automatic interface to back-office justice and financial systems.\nOur prosecutor system enables state attorney offices to track and manage criminal cases, including detailed victim information and private case notes. Investigative reports and charging instrument documents can be generated and stored for later viewing. Prosecutors can schedule and record the outcome of grand jury hearings. When integrated with the court system, prosecutors can view the electronic case file and related documents, as well as manage witness lists and subpoenas needed for court hearings.\nOur supervision system allows pre-trial and probation offices to manage offender caseloads. Supervision officers can track contact schedules, risk/needs assessments and reassessments, detailed drug test results, employment histories, compliance with conditions and payments of fees and restitution. Documents and forms, like pre-sentence investigations or revocation orders, can be generated and stored for easy viewing. When integrated with the jail and court systems, supervision officers obtain easy access and quick notification of offenders that have court hearings scheduled, are arrested locally, and have new warrants issued.\nWe also offer a court case management solution that automates and tracks all aspects of municipal courts and offices. It is a fully integrated, graphical application that provides effective case management, document processing and cash/bond management. This system complies with all state reporting and conviction reports and includes electronic reporting and also integrates with certain of our financial management solutions and public safety solutions.\nAlso our product solutions provide a suite of financial and communications applications ranging from deposit technologies for commissary, ordering, and warehouse technology to a host of informational, electronic communications, security, accounting, and financial trust management components for correctional facilities.\nPublic Safety\nOur public safety software is a fully unified and comprehensive solution for law enforcement, fire and EMS, including 911 / computer aided dispatch (“CAD”), records management, mobile computing, corrections management, Web-based information sharing and decision support. The modules are fully integrated, utilizing a common database and providing full functionality between modules, reducing data entry. The software provides fast, efficient dispatching, and quick access to records, reports and actionable information from an agency’s database.\nOur 911 / CAD solutions provide real-time, critical response dispatch functions in either single- or multi-jurisdictional environments. When integrated with our records management software, a vital link exists between dispatch and the most comprehensive records database available. Within seconds, the dispatch operator and the officer in the field can access critical information, such as prior incidents and outstanding warrants, increasing officer knowledge and safety. The solutions offer strong geographic information systems integration to help dispatchers quickly locate and send the best response during an emergency. Our 911 / CAD solutions dramatically improve performance, response time and unit safety.\nOur records management solutions for law enforcement and fire track statistical, operational, investigative and management data for inquiry and reporting. The systems create an efficient case processing workflow and help solve crimes with an accessible database that maintains central files on people, places, property, vehicles and criminal activity. Our public safety records management solutions enable easy access to information and simplify reporting.\nOur mobile computing solutions for law enforcement and fire provide instant access to local, state, regional and federal databases via mobile devices. Officers and firefighters can experience the benefits of obtaining critical, real-time information in the field, while saving time by preparing reports directly in their vehicles.\n5\nOur jail management systems document and manage information that meets the requirements of a modern jail facility. This includes the booking and housing of persons in custody, supervising defendants on a pre-trial release, maintaining offenders sentenced to local incarceration and billing other agencies for housing inmates. Searching, reporting and tracking features are integrated, allowing reliable, up-to-date access to current arrest and incarceration data, including digital mug shots. Our systems also provide warrant checks for visitors or book-ins, inmate classification and risk assessment, commissary, property and medical processing, automation of statistics, and state and federal reporting.\nOur civil processing solutions manage civil process needs from document receipt through service, payment process and final closeout. We also have a mobile electronic citation solution through which law enforcement officers can easily enter citation information in a mobile device, which is automatically uploaded into the court or public safety records management systems, rather than hand-writing citations that must be re-entered into the systems.\nProperty Appraisal and Tax\nWe provide systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property, including record keeping, mass appraisal, inquiry and protest tracking, appraisal and tax roll generation, tax statement processing, and electronic state-level reporting. These systems are image and video-enabled to facilitate the storage of and access to the many property-related documents and for the online storage of digital photographs of properties for use in defending values in protest situations. Other related tax applications are available for agencies that bill and collect taxes, including cities, counties, school tax offices, and special taxing and collection agencies. These systems support billing, collections, lock box operations, mortgage company electronic payments, and various reporting requirements.\nPlanning, Regulatory and Maintenance\nOur planning, regulatory and maintenance software solutions are designed for public sector agencies such as community development, planning, building, code enforcement, tax and revenues, public works, transportation, land control, environmental, fire safety, storm water management, regulatory controls and engineering. These solutions help public sector agencies better manage their day-to-day business functions while streamlining and automating the many aspects of their land management, permitting and planning systems. Our mobile solutions extend automation to the field and Web access brings online services to citizens 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nLand and Vital Records Managemen\nt\nWe also offer a number of specialized software applications designed to help local governments enhance and automate operations involving records and document management. These systems record, scan and index information for the many documents maintained by local governments, such as deeds, mortgages, liens, UCC financing statements and vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates). These applications include fully integrated imaging systems with batch and scan processing capabilities and fully integrated receipting and cashiering systems, as well as Web-enabled public access.\nOur content management solutions allow state and local governments and school districts to capture, deliver, manage and archive electronic information. These solutions streamline the flow of digital information throughout the organization to increase efficiency by transforming paper forms and documents into electronic images that drive key business processes.\nData and Insights\nOur data and insights solutions make existing government data discoverable, usable, and actionable for government workers and the people they serve. The data and insights solution includes a data-as-a-service platform and cloud applications for open data and citizen engagement, exclusively for city, county, state, and federal government organizations. Our data and insights solutions allow government to analyze, visualize, and securely share data across multiple departments and programs. These solutions deliver data-driven innovation and cost-savings by bringing together disparate systems and leveraging the cloud to dramatically enhance the effectiveness of government programs, to improve quality of life for residents, to positively impact local economies, and to achieve excellence in government operations.\nPlatform Technologies\nWe offer a low-code application development platform solution for case management and business process management. Whether based on premises or in the cloud, its Data-First™ approach allows the application to be implemented immediately and configured continuously, enabling clients to get to work quickly while keeping costs low. Our low code application platform allows government agencies the ability to track, collaborate, and report on the data that drives activities forward.\n6\nDigital Government Services\nWe deliver user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. Our digital government services unit designs, builds, and operates digital government services on an enterprise-wide basis on behalf of state and local governments desiring to provide access to government information and to complete secure government-based transactions through multiple digital channels. These digital government services consist of websites and applications that allow consumers, such as businesses and citizens, to access government information, complete transactions and make electronic payments. We also provide payment processing services, software development and digital government services, other than those services provided under state enterprise contracts, to federal agencies as well as state and local governments.\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from five primary sources:\n•\nSubscription-based services\n•\nMaintenance and support\n•\nProfessional services\n•\nSoftware licenses and royalties\n•\nAppraisal services\nSubscription-Based Services\nSubscriptions revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from our SaaS arrangements. We are able to provide the majority of our software products through our SaaS model. The clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or make up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. The contract terms for these arrangements range from one to ten years but are typically contracted for initial periods of three to five years. The majority of our SaaS or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services. In certain arrangements, the client may also acquire a license to the software.\nOther sources of subscriptions revenue are derived from transaction-based fees primarily related to digital government services, online payment solutions, which are sometimes offered with the assistance of third-party vendors, and online dispute resolution solutions. We also provide electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”) that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices. E-filing revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements.\nMaintenance and Support\nFollowing the implementation of our software systems, we provide ongoing software support services to assist our clients in operating the systems and to periodically update the software. Support is provided to clients over the phone or via the Web through help desks staffed by our client support representatives. For more complicated issues, our staff, with the clients' permission, can log on to clients’ systems remotely. We maintain our clients’ software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions of features and functionality, along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes.\nVirtually all of our software clients contract with us for maintenance and support, which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue. We generally provide maintenance and support for our on-premises clients under annual, or in some cases, multi-year contracts, with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product’s license fee. These fees can generally be increased on renewal and may also increase as new license fees increase. Maintenance and support fees are generally paid annually in advance. Most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or Tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration. Similar support is provided to our SaaS clients and is included in their subscription fees, which are classified as subscription-based revenue.\nProfessional Services\nWe provide a variety of professional services to clients who utilize our software products. Virtually all of our clients contract with us for installation, training, and data conversion services in connection with their implementation of Tyler’s software solutions. The complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning, design, data conversion, set-up and testing. At the culmination of the implementation process, a data implementation team is generally onsite at the client’s facility or available via remote video conferencing to ensure the smooth go-live with the new system. Implementation fees are charged separately to clients on either a fixed-fee or hourly charge basis, depending on the contract.\n7\nBoth in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis, we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services. Training can be provided in our training centers, onsite at clients’ locations, at meetings and conferences, or remotely, and can be customized to meet clients’ requirements. The vast majority of our clients contract with us for training services, both to improve their employees’ proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems. Training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis, along with travel and other expenses.\nSoftware Licenses and Royalties\nMany of our software arrangements involve “off-the-shelf” software. We recognize the revenue allocable to “off-the-shelf” software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer, unless the software is not considered distinct. We consider \"off-the-shelf\" software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code, it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation, and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or interrelated to the product's functionality.\nFor arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where professional services are otherwise not considered distinct, we recognize revenue over time by measuring progress-to-completion. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. These arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.\nSoftware license fees are billed in accordance with the contract terms. Typically, a majority of the fee is due when access to the software license is made available to the customer and the remainder of the fee due over a passage of time stipulated by the contract. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nWe recognize royalty revenue when the sale occurs under the terms of our third-party royalty arrangements. Currently, our third-party royalties are recognized on an estimated basis and adjusted if needed, when we receive notice of amounts we are entitled to receive. We typically receive notice of royalty revenue we are entitled to and billed on a quarterly basis in the quarter immediately following the royalty reporting period and adjustments have not been significant.\nAppraisal Services\nWe are the nation’s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities. These services include:\n•\nThe physical inspection of commercial and residential properties\n•\nData collection and processing\n•\nSophisticated computer analyses for property valuation\n•\nPreparation of tax rolls\n•\nCommunity education regarding the assessment process\n•\nArbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction\nLocal government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process. In some jurisdictions, law mandates reassessment cycles; in others, they are discretionary. While some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals in-house, many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it. Our appraisal services business unit has operated in this business since 1938.\nIn some instances, we also provide property tax and / or appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects, while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services. Appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects.\nSTRATEGY\nOur objective is to grow our revenues and earnings organically, supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions. The key components of our business strategy are to:\n•\nProvide high quality, value–added products and services to our clients\n. We compete on the basis of, among other things, delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in government operations through the highest value products and services in the market. We believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the government market.\n8\n•\nContinue to expand our product and service offerings\n. While we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments, we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients. We regularly add new products and services to our portfolio through internal product development as well as acquisitions. We believe that the addition of new features and applications enhances the market appeal of our core products. We have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services.\n•\nAccelerate our move to the cloud\n. We have offered most of our core products in both an on-premises license model and a cloud-based subscription model for several years and have seen a steady increase in the percentage of new software clients choosing our cloud model in recent years. Beginning in late 2019, we moved our approach to sales from “cloud-neutral” to “cloud-first,” with an increasing preference to provide our solutions in the cloud. We are making significant investments in optimizing our products to be deployed efficiently in the public cloud and over a multi-year period are transitioning from hosting clients in Tyler’s proprietary data centers to utilizing Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for cloud hosting.\n•\nExpand our client base\n. We seek to establish long-term relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts. While we currently have clients in all 50 states, Canada, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other international locations, some of our solutions have not fully achieved nationwide geographic penetration. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas. We also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include larger jurisdictions. While our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and mid-sized governments, our increased size and market presence, together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions, are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients. We also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the United States through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries.\n•\nExpand our existing client relationships\n. Our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer, but that existing clients do not fully utilize. Add-on sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expense than sales to new clients. In particular, we believe that the acquisition of NIC in April 2021 provides us with significant opportunities to sell Tyler software products into NIC’s client base and to provide NIC’s payment services to Tyler’s client base.\n•\nGrow recurring revenues\n. We have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscription-based services, which generated revenues of $1.5 billion, or 80% of total revenues, in 2022. We have historically experienced very low customer turnover (approximately 2% annually) and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases. Subscription-based revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years, increasing from $220.5 million in 2018 to $1.0 billion in 2022. We monitor Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), which is calculated based on quarter-to-date end total recurring revenues multiplied by four. ARR was $1.50 billion and $1.39 billion as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. ARR increased 8% compared to the prior period due to an increase in subscriptions revenue resulting from an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements.\n•\nMaximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business\n. We seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale, enabling us to provide value-added products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins. In addition, we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant long-term growth without proportionately increasing sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.\n•\nAttract and retain highly qualified employees\n. We believe that the depth and quality of our management and staff is one of our significant strengths, and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success. We believe that our stable management team, financial strength and growth opportunities, as well as our leadership position in the public sector market, enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees.\n•\nPursue strategic acquisitions\n. We selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following:\n◦\nNew products and services to complement our existing offerings\n◦\nEntry into new markets related to the public sector\n◦\nNew clients and/or geographic expansion\n9\n•\nEstablish strategic alliances\n. We have a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") for cloud hosting services, which brings together Tyler, the nation's largest software company exclusively focused on the public sector, and AWS, the broadest and deepest cloud platform. Specifically, the agreement with AWS provides the framework for development, training and collaboration in order to support next-generation applications that have the scalability, resiliency, and security AWS offers. AWS is assisting us in accelerating innovation and the development of strategic initiatives. These initiatives will bring the most advanced cloud-native services to Tyler clients, improving the flow of information and providing a better experience for state, local, and federal governments.\nSALES, MARKETING AND CLIENTS\nWe market our products and services primarily through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the United States. Other in-house sales staff focus on add-on sales, professional services and support. For certain products we also utilize a partner network for both sales and professional services, primarily in the state and federal markets.\nSales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality, referrals from other local governments, relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials, contacts at trade shows, direct mailings, and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us. We are active in numerous national, state, county, and local government associations and participate in annual meetings, trade shows, and educational events.\nClients consist primarily of federal, state, county and municipal agencies, school districts and other local government offices. In counties, clients include the auditor, treasurer, tax assessor/collector, county clerk, district clerk, county and district court judges, probation officers, sheriff, and county appraiser. At municipal government sites, clients include directors from various departments, including administration, finance, utilities, public works, code enforcement, personnel, purchasing, taxation, municipal court and police. At the state and federal levels, clients include Chief Information Officers and agency heads. Contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year, although some complex implementations may span multiple years, with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter. Although either the client or we can terminate these agreements, historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually. During 2022, approximately 25% of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements.\nCOMPETITION\nWe compete with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide. Many of these competitors are smaller companies that may offer less expensive solutions than ours. Many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area and / or in a narrow product or service niche. We also compete with national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do, including Oracle Corporation, Infor, SAP AG, Workday, Inc., CentralSquare Technologies, Thomson Reuters Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Axon Enterprise, Inc., and Constellation Software, Inc. In addition, we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms, which develop custom systems, primarily for larger governments. We also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of governments, which requires us to persuade the end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us.\nWe compete on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation, technological capabilities, and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client. Our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage. Governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process.\nSUPPLIERS\nSubstantially all of the computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software, office automation software, and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several third-party sources. Hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail. We have not experienced any significant supply problems.\nBACKLOG\nAt December 31, 2022, our revenue backlog was approximately $1.89 billion, compared to $1.80 billion at December 31, 2021. The backlog generally represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized. Approximately $886 million, or 47%, of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2023.\n10\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND LICENSES\nWe regard certain features of our internal operations, software, and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We generally do not rely on patents. We believe that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of support services. We typically license our software products under non-exclusive license agreements, which are generally non-transferable and have a perpetual term.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHuman Capital\nOur experienced, collaborative team is one of the most significant contributors to our success in empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer, and stronger communities. Our effectiveness in attracting and developing talented team members, many of whom spend the majority of their careers at Tyler serving our public sector clients, demonstrates our commitment to providing a welcoming and safe workplace, with a culture, benefits, and opportunities for our team members to continually grow and develop their careers within Tyler.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,200 team members. Approximately 335 of these team members are located in Canada and the Philippines; the remainder work remotely in the U.S. or are based in one of our nearly 80 U.S. offices. No Tyler employees are represented by unions. We believe our efforts in managing and supporting our workforce are effective, as evidenced by current levels of applicants, team member tenure, and high levels of engagement reported through continuous survey feedback from Tyler team members. Before we returned to office in January, the vast majority of team members worked remotely. After the return, 39% of team members became either partially or fully office based.\nOur team continues to work collaboratively with and for our clients and partners across multiple work arrangements: fully office-based, fully remote and a blended approach of office-based and remote work, which we refer to as flex-work. Regardless of where team members work, we do so together to develop for, sell to, implement and support our public sector clients.\nAt the end of 2022, Tyler’s U.S. workforce was 63% male and 37% female, and women represented 42% of Tyler’s leadership. Our workforce was comprised as follows: 71% White, 7% Asian, 4% Hispanic or Latino, 5% Black or African American, and 13% Other. For our leadership, the breakdown was 93% White, 5% Asian, 2% Hispanic or Latino. We define leadership as positions which are one or two levels removed from our CEO with management responsibility. Race and gender reporting are based on information provided by team members. Voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was 10% as of December 31, 2022, a decrease from 2021 turnover of 12.5%. The average tenure of our team members continues to be approximately seven years and approximately 27% of our employees have been employed by Tyler for more than ten years. The most frequent factor cited by team members leaving Tyler in 2022 was career opportunities with compensation also cited as a factor. Job offer compensation levels for roles in the tech sector continued to increase in 2022 at levels we have not experienced in well over a decade.\nInvestments in Talent\nWe are committed to providing Tyler team members with career growth opportunities and the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our talent assessment and development programs provide managers and employees with the resources needed to achieve career goals, build management skills and lead their teams.\nFor example, in 2022:\n•\n974 Tyler team members participated in close to 11,000 hours of AWS cloud certification training. There were 352 AWS accreditations and 228 certifications completed, as we continue to invest in developing cloud skills across the Tyler workforce.\n•\nAgain this year, over 200 Tyler managers participated in our 9-month Tyler Manager Development program which includes more than 50 hours of interactive, experiential learning, focused on developing skills managers need to lead a high performing team, plus multiple leadership assessments, including 360-degree feedback, and a dedicated mentor to support their development. To date, 42% of our management leads have participated in the program.\n•\nDivision Presidents and Corporate Function Executives conducted annual leadership assessment and talent reviews with their HR leaders and leadership teams to plan for succession and identify development priorities within their teams.\n•\nOur TylerU online training platform was utilized by over 8,100 team members who completed almost 35,000 hours of Tyler-sponsored AWS, management and compliance training to support continuous learning, professional training and development.\n11\nOversight and Management\nOur Human Resources team is tasked with leading and supporting our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, talent management and development. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) efforts. Management periodically reports to the Board and its committees human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.\nHealth & Safety\nWe invest in the well-being of Tyler team members and their families. We provide a range of offerings in support of mental and emotional, financial, and physical health and wellness not only for our team members, but also for the family members who depend on the\nm. The prolonged stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2022, and we extended the new benefits introduced in 2020, including enhanced mental health and telehealth benefits and full coverage for COVID illness and vaccinations.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including our team members of color, veterans and members of our LGBTQ community. Our networks of support, made up of local diversity, equity, and inclusion committees and employee resources groups, serve to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture.\nINTERNET WEBSITE AND AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC FILINGS\nWe file annual, quarterly, current and other reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-732-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and other information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC. The address of this site is http://www.sec.gov.\nWe also maintain a website at www.tylertech.com. We make available free of charge through this site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Forms 4 and 5, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to the SEC. In addition, copies of our annual report will be made available, free of charge, upon written request.\nOur “Code of Business Conduct and Ethics” is also available on our website. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements regarding amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on our website."

    "text": "An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors evaluating our company should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report. Any of the following factors could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and related Notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report. We may make forward-looking statements from time to time, both written and oral. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRisks Associated with Our Business, Including Our Software Products\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt our business and harm our competitive position.\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individuals and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to our clients and our IT. They may, for example, develop and deploy malicious software to attack our products and services and/or gain access to our networks and data centers or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and clients. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our\n12\nclients and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats. Despite the network and application security, internal control measures, and physical security procedures we employ to safeguard our systems, we may still be vulnerable to a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of confidential client data, transaction data, or proprietary company information, which may harm our business, reputation and future financial results. The lost revenue and containment, remediation, investigation, legal and other costs could be significant and may exceed our insurance policy limits or may not be covered by insurance at all. Further, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions and litigation that could result in financial judgments or the payment of settlement amounts and disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage.\nIn September 2020, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K reporting a security incident (the \"Incident\") involving ransomware disrupting access to some of our internal IT systems and telephone systems. We promptly notified our clients of the Incident and provided timely updates to our clients through direct communications and updates to our website. There is no evidence that the environments where we host client applications were affected, and our hosting services to those clients were not interrupted. There was also no evidence of malicious activity on client networks associated with the Incident. We contained the Incident and recovered from it, resuming normal operations with our clients. We deployed supplemental remediation efforts as necessary and cooperated with law enforcement’s investigation.\nAlthough we completed our investigation into the Incident and believe we contained and recovered from the Incident, we are subject to risk and uncertainties as a result of the Incident. There can be no assurance as to what the ongoing impact of the Incident will be, if any. We maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is adequate.\nDisclosure of personally identifiable information and/or other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nWe store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information and other confidential information of our clients. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve security controls, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of sensitive client data that we store and manage. Disclosure of personally identifiable information and/or other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nWe depend on third parties with whom we engage or collaborate for certain projects, deliverables, and/or financial transaction processes. If these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or we are unable to maintain these relationships, our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected.\nTo satisfy our obligations under client contracts, we often engage third parties to provide certain deliverables or fulfill certain requirements. We may also use third parties to ensure that our services and solutions integrate with the software, systems, or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers. Our ability to serve our clients and deliver our solutions in a timely manner depends on our ability to retain and maintain relationships with third-party vendors and service providers and the ability of these third parties to meet their obligations in a timely manner, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. If any third party fails to perform on a timely basis the agreed-upon services, our ability to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. Third-party performance deficiencies could result in breaches of our obligations with respect to, or the termination for default of, one or more of our client contracts. A breach or termination for default could expose us to liability for damages and have an adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition and our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nA global economic slowdown, the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar circumstances could also adversely affect the businesses of our third-party providers, hindering their ability to provide the services on which we rely. Our agreements with third parties typically are non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may act as subcontractor to a third-party prime contractor to secure new projects. Subcontracting arrangements where we are not the prime contractor pose unique risks to us because we may not have control over the customer relationship, and our ability to generate revenues under such subcontracts may depend on the prime contractor, its performance and relationship with the customer, and its relationship with us. We could suffer losses in the event a prime contract under which we serve as a subcontractor is terminated, whether for non-performance by the prime contractor or otherwise. Upon a termination of the prime contract, our subcontract would similarly terminate, and the resulting contract loss could have an adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition and our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\n13\nWe rely on third-party providers—including Amazon Web Services—for hosting services and other technology-related services needed to deliver certain of our cloud solutions. Any disruption in the services provided by such third-party providers could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.\nA material portion of our business is provided through software hosting services, which are sometimes hosted from and use computing infrastructure provided by third parties, including Amazon Web Services. These hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications or Internet failure, acts of terrorism, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, and other similar damaging events. If any of our data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period, we might be unable to fulfill our contractual commitments. Although we take what we believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences, we can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of our services, which could result in client dissatisfaction, loss of revenues, and damage to our business.\nThird-party hosting service providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transition to a new provider and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, such service providers could decide to close their facilities or change or suspend their service offerings without adequate notice to us. Moreover, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by such service providers may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Because we cannot easily switch third-party hosting service providers, any disruption with respect to our current providers would impact our operations and our business could be adversely impacted.\nProblems faced by our hosting service providers could adversely affect the experience of our customers. For example, Amazon Web Services has experienced significant service outages in the past and may do so again in the future.\nIn addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business.\nMaterial portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be reliable.\nPart of our future success continues to depend on the use of the Internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically, including, for example, electronic filing of court documents. This in part requires ongoing maintenance of the Internet infrastructure, especially to prevent interruptions in service, as well as additional development of that infrastructure. This requires a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, security, and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable Internet access and services. If this infrastructure fails to be sufficiently developed or be adequately maintained, our business would be harmed because users may not be able to access our government portals.\nWe employ third-party licensed software and software components for use in or with our solutions, and the inability to maintain these licenses or the presence of errors or security vulnerabilities in the software we license could limit the functionality of our products and result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe incorporate and include third-party software into and with certain of our products and solutions. We also use third-party software and tools in certain areas of the development process for our solutions. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their software or tools available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, not make their products available to our competitors on more favorable terms, invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software, or remain in business. Any impairment in our relationship with these third parties or our ability to license or otherwise use their software or tools could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software and tools we currently license, this may not always be the case, or they may be difficult, time-consuming, or costly to replace. In addition, although we maintain a supplier security evaluation process, if the third-party software or tools we use has or have errors, security vulnerabilities, or otherwise malfunctions, the functionality of our solutions may be negatively impacted, our customers may experience reduced service levels, and our business may suffer.\n14\nCertain of our solutions utilize open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our solutions include software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our solutions. It is possible under the terms of certain open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, that we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and make our proprietary software available under open source licenses. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our solutions, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our solutions, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could adversely affect our business.\nWe run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products.\nOur software products are complex and may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Any such defects could result in a loss of revenues or delay market acceptance. Our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability. However, it is possible we may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in our client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions. Although we maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance, and we try to structure contracts to limit liability, we cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nWe must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive.\nThe market for our products is characterized by technological change, evolving industry standards in software technology, changes in client requirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements, and achieve market acceptance. We cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. The products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others could also render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire new software products or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary rights.\nMany of our product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of contracts, copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We cannot be certain that we have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property. There has also been an apparent evolution in the legal standards and regulations courts and the U.S. patent office may apply in favorably evaluating software patent rights. We are not currently involved in any material intellectual property litigation; however, we may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect our proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to current or future products. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, costly, and a diversion to management. Any such claims and litigation could also cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Therefore, litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.\nClients may elect to terminate our maintenance contracts and manage operations internally.\nIt is possible that our clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for our software, trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights (excluding software applications that we provide on a hosted or cloud basis). Alternatively, clients may elect to drop maintenance on certain modules that they ultimately decide not to use. This could adversely affect our revenues and profits. Additionally, they may inadvertently allow our intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third parties, including our competitors, which could adversely affect our business.\n15\nRisks Associated with Selling Products and Services into the Public Sector Marketplace\nSelling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of software and services to state, county, and city governments, other federal or municipal agencies, and other public entities. We expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues in the future. We face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities, including:\n•\nResource limitations caused by budgetary constraints, which may provide for a termination of executed contracts due to a lack of future funding\n•\nLong and complex sales cycles\n•\nContract payments at times being subject to achieving implementation milestones, and we may have differences with clients as to whether milestones have been achieved\n•\nPolitical resistance to the concept of contracting with third parties to provide IT solutions\n•\nLegislative changes affecting a local government’s authority to contract with third parties\n•\nVarying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance\n•\nVarious other political factors, including changes in governmental administrations and personnel\nEach of these risks is outside our control. If we fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nCOVID-19 may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe expect that the continued global presence of COVID-19 may negatively impact our business and financial results in fiscal year 2023. As the virus continues to persist, increased infection rates (generally or as the result of new strains of the virus) may result in government authorities returning to stricter measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, and business limitations and shutdowns.\nWhile we are unable\nto accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will continue to have on our results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and associated compliance, the pandemic may negatively impact our revenues and other financial results.\nBecause an increasing portion of our revenues are recurring, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We may see some more immediate impact on our business should there be new delays in government procurement processes and uncertainty around public sector budgets, or new delays in implementations caused by travel restrictions, closed offices, or clients shifting focus to more pressing issues.\nAppraisal and software implementations projects may be delayed if clients put projects on hold or slow projects by extending go-live dates. While we have the ability to deliver most of our professional services remotely, some of our professional services, including appraisal assessments, are more effective when performed on-site, and certain clients may continue to insist on on-site services in any event. In addition, our delivery of some professional services requires the availability of client personnel. There may be a negative impact on our revenues if we are unable to deliver these services. Also, we expect software licenses and subscriptions revenues to be negatively affected if there are delays in procurement processes. Some clients could request changes to payment terms, negatively impacting the timing of collections of accounts receivables in future periods. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 80% of our total revenues and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription and maintenance revenue, which is recurring in nature; thus the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods.\nWe have historically evaluated goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if impairment indicators arose. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events, which could be caused or impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\nA prolonged economic slowdown could harm our operations.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for our software products and services. Governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect our growth rate and profitability in the future. There is no assurance that government spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions, and if budget shortfalls occur, they may negatively impact government IT spending and could adversely affect our business.\n16\nThe open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards.\nMany governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process. Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to these requests for proposals, we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations for the proposed client, and the likely terms of any other third-party proposals submitted. We cannot guarantee that we will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. Our failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process, or to secure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.\nWe face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into our markets.\nWe believe we are a leading provider of integrated solutions for the public sector. However, we face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software. We compete based on a number of factors, including:\n•\nThe attractiveness of our “evergreen” business model\n•\nThe breadth, depth, and quality of our product and service offerings\n•\nThe ability to modify our offerings to accommodate particular clients’ needs\n•\nTechnological innovation\n•\nName recognition, reputation and references\n•\nPrice\n•\nOur financial strength and stability\nOur market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size, product platform, and product scope. Our competitors include consulting firms, publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market, and a significant number of smaller, privately held companies. Certain competitors have greater technical, marketing, and financial resources than we do. We cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to our products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance.\nWe also compete with internal, centralized IT departments of governmental entities, which requires us to persuade the end-user to stop the internal service and outsource to us. In addition, our clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for our services.\nWe could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased competition could result in pricing pressure, fewer client orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective clients. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nFixed-price contracts may affect our profits.\nSome of our contracts are structured on a fixed-price basis, which can lead to various risks, including:\n•\nThe failure to accurately estimate the resources and time required for an engagement\n•\nThe failure to effectively manage our clients’ expectations regarding the scope of services delivered for a fixed fee\n•\nThe failure to timely and satisfactorily complete fixed-price engagements within budget\nIf we do not adequately assess and manage these and other risks, we may be subject to cost overruns and penalties, which may harm our financial performance.\nChanges in the insurance markets may affect our business.\nSome of our clients, primarily those for our property appraisal services, require that we secure performance bonds before they will select us as their vendor. In addition, we have in the past been required to provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of a performance bond. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure such performance bonds in the future on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Our inability to obtain performance bonds on favorable terms or at all could impact our future ability to win some contract awards, particularly large property appraisal services contracts, which could negatively impact revenues. In addition, the general insurance markets may experience volatility and/or restrictive coverage trends, which may lead to future increases in our general and administrative expense and negatively impact our operating results.\n17\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not otherwise have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon a fundamental change, or to repay our indebtedness obligations under our 2021 Credit Agreement, each of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $600 million of our Convertible Senior Notes and $395 million under our 2021 Credit Agreement. In April 2021, we entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement with significantly increased borrowing capacity of up to $1.4 billion and on the closing of the acquisition of NIC on April 21, 2021, we borrowed initial loans in the aggregate principal amount of $1.15 billion. The 2021 Credit Agreement also has an option to increase the amount available up to an additional $500 million subject to our leverage and other factors. The proceeds from the issuance of our Convertible Senior Notes and from loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement were used as sources of funding for the acquisition of NIC. Our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions, and we and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business would increase and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nPursuant to their terms, holders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of their Convertible Senior Notes under certain circumstances. Upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be obligated to make cash payments. In addition, holders of our Convertible Senior Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture, dated as of March 9, 2021, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) (the “Indenture”), at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Although it is our intention, and we currently expect to have the ability, to settle the Convertible Senior Notes in cash, there is a risk that we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Senior Notes surrendered or Convertible Senior Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the Indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of other indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the other indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payments upon conversion or repurchase demands with respect to our Convertible Senior Notes, or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness, and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCovenant restrictions under our indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and earnings per share.\nThe Indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2021 Credit Agreement do, and our future indebtedness agreements may, contain covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. Subject to customary carve-outs, thresholds and baskets, the 2021 Credit Agreement (and the Indenture by means of a cross-default) restricts, absent consent of the agent and lenders under the 2021 Credit Agreement, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n•    Incur additional indebtedness,\n•    Permit liens on our assets,\n•    Make certain investments, acquisitions and dispositions,\n•    Make certain specified fundamental changes, and\n•    Make certain restricted payments.\n18\nIn addition, the 2021 Credit Agreement (and the Indenture by means of a cross-default) contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default. The 2021 Credit Agreement is unsecured but requires us to maintain certain financial ratios regarding our total leverage and interest coverage and other financial conditions in addition to the restrictions described above. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may result in a breach of any of these covenants and result in a default under the 2021 Credit Agreement that may, in turn, result in a default under the Indenture. If an event of default under the 2021 Credit Agreement occurs, the lenders could terminate all commitments to lend and elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to pay such amounts, the lenders could proceed against the guarantees by our direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries. Should the lenders proceed against the guarantees, we cannot give assurance that we would have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the 2021 Credit Agreement and the Convertible Senior Notes.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects the Company to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement are, and are expected to continue to be, at variable rates of interest and expose Tyler to interest rate risk. If interest rates continue to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. Revolving credit facility loans and Term A-1 Loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the administrative agent’s prime commercial lending rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) (the “Base Rate”) plus a margin of 0.125% to 0.75% or (2) the one-, three-, six-, or, subject to approval by all lenders, twelve-month LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.75%. Our Term A-2 Loans bear interest, at our option, at a per annum rate of either (1) the Base Rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.5% or (2) the one-, three-, six-, or, subject to approval by all lenders, twelve-month LIBOR rate plus a margin of 0.875% to 1.5%. The margin in each case is based upon our total net leverage ratio, as determined pursuant to the 2021 Credit Agreement. Based on the debt under the 2021 Credit Agreement, the aggregate principal outstanding balance as of December 31, 2022 is $395.0 million, and each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $1.0 million change in annual interest expense.\nLIBOR, the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, is currently anticipated to be phased out in June 2023 and is expected to transition to a new standard rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which will incorporate certain overnight repo market data collected from multiple data sets. In January 2023, we amended our 2021 Credit Agreement to replace the LIBOR reference rate with the SOFR reference rate. Assuming that SOFR replaces LIBOR and is appropriately adjusted to equate to one-month LIBOR, we expect that there should be minimal impact on our operations.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Senior Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of our Convertible Senior Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Senior Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Senior Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Senior Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nTransactions relating to our Convertible Senior Notes may affect the value of our common stock.\nOur Convertible Senior Notes may become convertible in the future at the option of their holders under certain circumstances. If holders of our Convertible Senior Notes elect to convert their notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing shareholders.\n19\nRisks Associated with Our Periodic Results and Stock Price\nFluctuations in quarterly revenues could adversely impact our operating results and stock price.\nOur revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons, including:\n•\nThe size of license transactions can vary significantly\n•\nClients may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in strategic priorities, project objectives, budget, or personnel\n•\nClient purchasing processes vary significantly and a client’s internal approval, expenditure authorization, and contract negotiation processes can be difficult and time consuming to complete, even after selection of a vendor\n•\nThe number, timing, and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by us and our competitors may affect purchase decisions\n•\nWe may have to defer revenues under our revenue recognition policies and GAAP\n•\nClients may elect subscription-based arrangements, which result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional, on-premise software license arrangements, but generate higher recurring revenues over the term of the contract\nIn each fiscal quarter, our expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed. If our actual revenues fall below expectations, we could experience a reduction in operating results. Also, if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations, it may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nIncreases in investment in research and development could decrease overall margins.\nAn important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from companies that we have acquired. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position, and research and development expense could adversely affect operating margins.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. Examples of factors that may significantly impact our stock price include:\n•\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results\n•\nAnnouncements of technological innovations, new products, or new contracts by us or our competitors\n•\nDevelopments with respect to patents, copyrights, or other proprietary rights\n•\nConditions and trends in the software and other technology industries\n•\nChanges in financial estimates by securities analysts\n•\nGeneral market conditions and other factors\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our stock. Sometimes, securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities. We cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance.\nOur financial outlook may not be realized.\nFrom time to time, in press releases and otherwise, we may publish forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding our results, including estimated revenues or earnings. Any forecast of our future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors (including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot be certain that our performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize our entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us, our products and services, and the software industry when evaluating our prospective results of operations.\n20\nRisks Associated with Our Growth Strategy and Other General Corporate Risks\nWe may experience difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy.\nA material portion of our historical growth has resulted from strategic acquisitions. Although our focus is on organic internal growth, we will continue to identify and pursue strategic acquisitions with suitable candidates. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that a transaction does not advance our business strategy; that we do not achieve the expected return on our investment; that we have difficulty integrating business systems and technology; that we have difficulty retaining or integrating new employees; that the transactions distract management from our other businesses; that we acquire unforeseen liabilities; and other unanticipated events. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our operations. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits of these transactions, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or increased market share, or the benefits may be ultimately less than we expected. Although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisition candidates, we may not identify all material liabilities or risks related to acquisition candidates. There can be no assurance that any such strategic acquisitions will be accomplished on favorable terms or will result in profitable operations.\nOur failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business.\nWe continue to expand our operations by pursuing existing and potential market opportunities. This growth places significant demands on management and operational resources. In order to manage growth effectively, we must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures, and controls on a timely basis. If we fail to implement these systems, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to hire, integrate, and retain qualified personnel.\nOur continued success will depend upon the availability and performance of our key management, sales, marketing, client support, and product development personnel. The loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect us. We believe that our continued success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, integrate, and retain such personnel. We have at times experienced and continue to experience challenges in recruiting qualified personnel. Competition for qualified software development, sales, and other personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. In addition, competitive job markets may increase our costs relating to compensation packages due to higher salary expectations and pressures.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance, compliance, and public disclosure can create uncertainty for public companies. The costs required to comply with such evolving laws across the various states and at the federal level are difficult to predict and/or harmonize. To maintain high standards of corporate governance, compliance, and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards. This investment may result in an unforeseen increase in general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities, which may harm our operating results.\nWe do not foresee paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not declared nor paid a cash dividend since we entered the business of providing software solutions and services to the public sector in 1998. We intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.\nOur board of directors may issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of these preferred shares. These determinations may be made without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law could also delay, prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving us."

For a comparison of our Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, and our Cash Flow discussion for the year ended December 2021, see “Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on February 23, 2022.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “plans,” “intends,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “projects,” “might,” “could” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward-looking statements, but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward-looking statements. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs: (1) the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its potential effects on the economic environment, our customers and our operations, as well as any changes to federal, state or local government laws, regulations or orders in connection with the pandemic; (2) changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our clients, primarily local and state governments, that could negatively impact information technology spending; (3) disruption to our business and harm to our competitive position resulting from cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities; (4) our ability to protect client information from security breaches and provide uninterrupted operations of data centers; (5) our ability to achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses, while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations; (6) material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be adequately maintained; (7) our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors, including project delays by our clients, reductions in transaction size, fewer transactions, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements; (8) general economic, political and market conditions, including inflation and changes in interest rates; (9) technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services; (10) competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing, client retention and pressure for new products or services; (11) the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel; and (12) costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector. We develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the IT needs of public sector entities. We provide subscription-based services such as software as a service (“SaaS”), transaction-based fees primarily related to digital government services and online payment processing, and electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”), which simplify the filing and management of court related documents. In addition, we provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and for certain clients, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for clients using our systems. Additionally, we provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing\njurisdictions.\nWe provide our software systems and related professional services and appraisal services through seven business units, which focus on the following products:\n•\nfinancial management, education and planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;\n•\nfinancial management, municipal courts, planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;\n•\ncourts and justice and public safety software solutions;\n•\ndata and insights solutions;\n•\nappraisal and tax software solutions, land and vital records management software solutions, and property appraisal services;\n•\ndevelopment platform solutions including case management and business process management; and\n•\ndigital government and payments solutions.\n25\nIn accordance with ASC 280-10,\nSegment Reporting\n, we report our results in\ntwo\nreportable segments. The Enterprise Software (“ES”) reportable segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical “back-office” functions such as: financial management and education; planning, regulatory and maintenance; courts and justice; public safety; data and insights; appraisal and tax software solutions; land and vital records management software solutions; and property appraisal services. The Platform Technologies (“PT”) reportable segment provides public sector entities with software solutions to perform transaction processing, streamline data processing, and improve operations and workflows such as digital government and payments solutions and development platform solutions.\nWe evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment operating income. We define segment operating income for our business units as income before non-cash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisitions, interest expense, and income taxes. Segment operating income includes intercompany transactions. The majority of intercompany transactions relate to contracts involving more than one unit and are valued based on the contractual arrangement. Corporate segment operating loss primarily consists of compensation costs for the executive management team, certain shared services staff, and share-based compensation expense for the entire company. Corporate segment operating income also includes revenues and expenses related to a company-wide user conference.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the appraisal and tax software solutions, land and vital records management software solutions, and property appraisal service business unit, which was previously reported in the Appraisal & Tax (\"A&T\") reportable segment, was moved to the ES reportable segment. The digital government and payments solutions, which was previously reported in the NIC reportable segment, and development platform solutions moved to the PT reportable segment to reflect changes in the way in which management makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. As a result of the changes in our reportable segments, the former A&T and NIC reportable segments are no longer considered separate segments. Prior period amounts for the ES and PT reportable segments have been adjusted to reflect the segment change. See Note 17, \"Segment and Related Information,\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCertain amounts for previous years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. We have elected to present amortization of software development, previously included in the cost of revenues software licenses and royalties line item, in a separate category line item on the consolidated statements of income for all reporting periods presented. Previously disclosed as selling, general and administrative expense is now disclosed in separate line items: sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of income for all reporting periods presented.\nRecent Acquisitions\n2022\nOn October 31, 2022, we acquired Rapid Financial Solutions, LLC, a principal provider of reliable, scalable, and secure payments with best-in-class card issuance and digital disbursement capabilities.\nThe total purchase price, net of\ncash acquired of $2.2 million, was approximately $67.7 million, consisting of $51.2 million paid in cash, $18.2 million of common stock, and $500,000 related to working capital holdbacks, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nOn February 8, 2022, we acquired US eDirect Inc. (US eDirect), a leading provider of technology solutions for campground and outdoor recreation management. The total purchase price, net of\ncash acquired of $6.4 million, was approximately $116.5 million, consisting of $118.8 million paid in cash and approximately $4.1 million related to indemnity holdbacks.\n2021\nOn September 9, 2021, we acquired all the equity interest of Ultimate Information Systems, Inc. (dba Arx). Arx is a cloud-based platform which creates accessible technology to enable a modern-day police force that is fully transparent, accountable, and a trusted resource to the community it serves. The total purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $12.8 million.\nOn September 1, 2021, we acquired VendEngine, Inc (VendEngine), a cloud-based software provider focused on financial technology for the corrections market. The total purchase price, net of cash acquired of $1.7 million, was approximately $83.6 million, consisting of $81.6 million paid in cash, and approximately $3.8 million related to indemnity holdbacks.\nOn April 21, 2021, we acquired NIC, a leading digital government solutions and payment company that primarily serves federal and state government agencies. The total purchase price, net of cash acquired of $331.8 million, was approximately $2.0 billion, consisting of cash paid of $2.3 billion and $1.9 million of purchase consideration related to the conversion of unvested restricted stock awards.\nOn March 31, 2021, we completed two acquisitions, Glass Arc, Inc. (dba ReadySub) and DataSpec, Inc. (DataSpec), for the combined purchase price of $12.1 million.\n26\n2022 Operating Results\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, total revenues increased 16% compared to the prior period. Excluding the 2022 impact of recent acquisitions\n1\n, total revenues increased 4% compared to prior period. Revenues from acquisitions contributed 12.4% of growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nSubscriptions revenue grew 29.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, due to an ongoing shift toward a cloud-based, software as a service business model, as well as the inclusion of transaction-based revenue from NIC’s digital government and payments processing businesses. Excluding the 2022 impact of recent acquisitions\n1\n, subscriptions revenue increased 6.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nThe majority of our revenues are comprised of revenues from subscriptions and maintenance, which we consider to be recurring revenues. Annualized recurring revenues (\"ARR\") is calculated based on quarter-to-date end total recurring revenues multiplied by four. ARR was $1.50 billion and $1.39 billion as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. ARR increased 8% compared to the prior period, due to an increase in subscriptions revenue due to an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, total revenues include COVID-related subscriptions revenue of $10.8 million from NIC’s Tour Health offering and professional services revenue of $40.2 million from pandemic unemployment and Virginia rent relief offerings. These programs all ended in 2022 and we do not expect to generate COVID-related subscriptions revenue and professional services revenue in future periods.\nWe monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. These indicators include the following:\nRevenues – We derive our revenues from five primary sources: subscription-based arrangements; maintenance; professional services; sale of software licenses and royalties; and appraisal services. Subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 80% of our revenues in 2022. The number of new SaaS clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our SaaS model are a significant driver of our revenue growth, together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases. We monitor ARR which is calculated based on quarter-to-date end total recurring revenues multiplied by four. As of December 31, 2022, ARR was $1.50 billion. In addition, we also monitor our customer base and turnover, which historically is very low. During 2022, based on our number of customers, turnover was approximately 2%.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margins – Our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation, subscription-based services, maintenance and support, and appraisal services to our clients. We can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base, especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost, such as software licenses and royalties, subscription-based services, and maintenance and support. Our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature, and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short-term basis to coincide with the life of a project. As of December 31, 2022, our total employee count included in cost of revenues increased to 5,021 from 4,746 at December 31, 2021, including 56 employees who joined us through acquisitions completed since December 31, 2021.\nSales and Marketing (“S&M”) Expense – The primary components of S&M expense include sales personnel salaries and share-based compensation expense, sales commissions, travel-related expenses, advertising and marketing materials, and allocated depreciation, facilities, and IT support. Sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and share-based compensation expense generally increases based increased level of awards issues during the period and as the market price of our stock increases. Other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative (“G&A”) Expense – The primary components of G&A expense include personnel salaries and share-based compensation expense for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, third party professional fees, travel-related expenses, insurance, allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses. Share-based compensation expense generally increases as the market price of our stock increases. Other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues.\nLiquidity and Cash Flows – The primary driver of our cash flows is net income. Uses of cash include acquisitions, capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock. Our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned. In recent years,\n1\nExcludes the 2022 incremental impact as a result of not having the recent acquisition for a full fiscal year.\n27\nwe have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nBalance Sheet – Cash, accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business.\nOutlook\nThe local government software market continues to be active with sales activity trending at or near pre-pandemic levels in most sectors of our business, and our backlog at December 31, 2022 reached $1.89 billion, a 5% increase from the prior period. We expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenues and earnings. With our strong financial position and cash flow, we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development and accelerating our move to the cloud to better position us to continue to expand our addressable market and strengthen our competitive position over the long term. The expenses associated with the cloud transition are expected to pressure operating margins in 2023 and 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues, cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosure of contingencies. The Notes to the Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the progress toward completion methods of revenue recognition, estimated standalone selling price (\"SSP\") for distinct performance obligations, the fair value amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, determination of share-based compensation expense and allowance for losses and sales adjustments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe earn revenues from software licenses, royalties, subscription-based services, professional services, post-contract customer support (“PCS” or “maintenance”), hardware, and appraisal services. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n•\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n•\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n•\nDetermination of the transaction price\n•\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n•\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\nOur software arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations that range from software licenses and SaaS arrangements, installation, training, and consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs (services), hosting, and PCS. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately when they are distinct. We evaluate whether separate performance obligations can be distinct or should be accounted for as one performance obligation. Arrangements that include professional services, such as training or installation, are evaluated to determine whether the customer can benefit from the services either on their own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and whether the services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Many of our software arrangements involve “off-the-shelf” software. We recognize the revenue allocable to \"off-the-shelf\" software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer, unless the software is not considered distinct. We consider off-the-shelf software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code, it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation, and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the product's functionality.\n28\nFor arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where professional services are otherwise not considered distinct, we recognize revenue over time by measuring progress-to-completion. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. These arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent. When professional services are distinct, the fee allocable to the service element is recognized over the time we perform the services and is billed on a time and material or milestones basis.\nSubscription-based services consist of revenues derived from SaaS arrangements, transaction and payment processing, electronic filing transactions, and digital government services. Revenue from subscription-based services is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. For SaaS arrangements, we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third-party to host the software. We allocate contract value to each performance obligation of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a distinct element based on estimated SSP. We recognize SaaS arrangements ratably over the terms of the arrangements, which range from one to ten years, but are typically for periods of three to five years. For professional services associated with certain SaaS arrangements, we have concluded that the services are not distinct, and we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nFor transaction and payments revenue and e-filing transaction fees, we have the right to charge the customer an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date. Therefore, we recognize revenue for these services over time based on the amount billable to the customer in accordance with the 'as invoiced' practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18. In some cases, we are paid on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenue ratably over the contractual period. Typically, the structure of our arrangements does not give rise to variable consideration. However, in those instances whereby variable consideration exists, we include in our estimates, additional revenue for variable consideration when we believe we have an enforceable right, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable.\nThe transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. We determine the SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nWe use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine SSP using the expected cost-plus margin approach. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for sales adjustments and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nWe maintain allowances for losses and sales adjustments, which losses are recorded against revenues at the time the loss is incurred. Since most of our clients are domestic governmental entities, we rarely incur a credit loss resulting from the inability of a client to make required payments. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount for the allowances for losses and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, managing our client’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products. Our allowance for losses and sales adjustments of $14.8 million and $12.1 million at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, does not include provisions for credit losses. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\n, and primarily evaluated our historical experience with credit losses related to trade and other receivables. Because we rarely experience credit losses with our clients, we have not recorded a material reserve for credit losses.\nIn connection with certain of our contracts, we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date. Many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period. We review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue. In addition, we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue, which represents billings in excess of revenue earned. The majority of this liability consists of subscriptions and maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the subscription or maintenance billing period, generally one year. We also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met. On a periodic basis, we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate.\n29\nBusiness Combinations.\nAccounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. The determination of fair value requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, and in making these determinations, management uses all available information.\nFor tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, management estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include, but are not limited to, discount rates, future revenues and operating costs, projections of capital costs, and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.\nDue to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the closing date. If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination as well as the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\n. Our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances, and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense, as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge. The cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value, with the excess allocated to goodwill. Accordingly, we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets, including software, customer related intangibles, trade name, leases and goodwill. These intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below. When testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively, we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions (Level 3 inputs). The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization.\nDuring the fourth quarter, as part of our annual impairment test as of October 1, we performed qualitative assessments for the reporting units containing the recently acquired data and insights, digital government and payments solutions, and development platform solutions, and concluded no impairment existed as of our annual assessment date. Approximately $1.7 billion, or 70%, of total goodwill as of December 31, 2022, relates to these reporting units, which as a result of these recent acquisitions, do not have significant excess fair values over carrying values. We performed qualitative assessments for the remaining reporting units in which we determined that it not more likely than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value; therefore, we did not perform a Step 1 quantitative impairment test. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. During 2022, we have recorded no impairment to goodwill as no triggering events or change in circumstances indicating a potential impairment has occurred as of period-end.\nDetermining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Changes in market conditions or other factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause us to change key assumptions and our judgment about a reporting unit’s prospects. Similarly, in a specific period, a reporting unit could significantly underperform relative to its historical or projected future operating results. Either situation could result in a meaningfully different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, and a consequent future impairment charge.\n30\nAll intangible assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and reductions in growth rates. In addition, products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non-competitive. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets. During 2022, we did not identify any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of our intangible assets may not be recoverable.\nRecent adoption of new accounting pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 -\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n(ASC 805) (“ASU 2021-08”). ASU 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. Under this \"Topic 606 approach,\" the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the contracts. This is a departure from the current requirement to measure contract assets and contract liabilities at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for all public business entities in annual and interim periods starting after December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. An entity that early adopts should apply the amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. We early adopted as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 resulted in no adjustments to the fair value of the deferred revenue balances assumed in our 2022 acquisitions. See Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nRecent Accounting Guidance not yet Adopted\nThere were no new not yet adopted accounting pronouncements currently issued that would affect the Company or have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods.\n31\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER\nThe following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n2022 Compared to 2021\nRevenues\nRecent Acquisitions\nOn October 31, 2022, we acquired Rapid Financial Solutions, LLC (Rapid), a provider of reliable, scalable, and secure payments with best-in-class card issuance and digital disbursement capabilities.\nOn February 8, 2022, we acquired US eDirect Inc. (US eDirect), a leading provider of technology solutions for campground and outdoor recreation management.\nOn April 21, 2021, we acquired NIC, Inc., a leading digital government solutions and payment company that serves federal, state and local government agencies. US eDirect and Rapid are operated as a part of the digital government and payment solutions business unit (also known as the NIC division) and the results of NIC, US eDirect, and Rapid from their respective dates of acquisition, are included with the operating results of the PT segment.\n32\nThe following table details revenues for the NIC division for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2022 and 2021, which are presented in our consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition and included in the operating results of the PT reportable segment (in thousands).\nSubscriptions.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nSubscriptions revenue consists of revenue derived from our SaaS arrangements and transaction-based fees primarily related to digital government services and payment processing. We also provide electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”) that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices. E-filing revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements.\nSubscriptions revenue grew 29% compared to 2021, primarily due to the inclusion of transaction-based revenues from NIC including Rapid and US eDirect from the respective dates of acquisition. Excluding the incremental impact of recent acquisitions, subscriptions revenue increased 6%. New SaaS clients as well as existing clients who converted to our SaaS model provided the majority of the subscriptions revenue increase. In 2022, we added 609 new SaaS clients and 336 existing clients elected to convert to our SaaS model. Our mix of new software contracts in 2022 was approximately 23% perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 77% subscription-based arrangements compared to total new client mix in 2021 of approximately 33% perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 67% subscription-based arrangements.\nTotal subscriptions revenue derived from transaction-based fees was $600.8 million and $454.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase of $146.0 million or 32% is attributable to inclusion of the NIC division, including Rapid and US eDirect transaction-based revenues from the respective dates of acquisition. Transaction-based revenue from the NIC division was $470.9 million and $344.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Excluding NIC, transaction-based fees contributed $19.8 million to the increase in subscriptions revenue due to the increased volumes of online payments and e-filing services in 2022.\n2\nExcludes the 2022 incremental impact as a result of not having the recent acquisition for a full fiscal year.\n33\nMaintenance.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nWe provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third-party software. Maintenance revenue decreased 1% compared to the prior period. Maintenance revenue declined mainly due to attrition related to a legacy case management solution and clients converting from on-premises license arrangements to SaaS, partially offset by annual maintenance rate increases and maintenance associated with new software license sales.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenues\nSubscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources. Annualized recurring revenues (\"ARR\") is calculated based on quarter-end total recurring revenues multiplied by four. ARR was $1.50 billion and $1.39 billion as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. ARR increased 8% compared to the prior period due to an increase in subscriptions revenue resulting from an ongoing shift toward SaaS arrangements.\nProfessional services.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our professional services revenue for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software, converting client data, training client personnel, custom development activities and consulting. New clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses or subscriptions generally also contract with us to provide the related professional services. Existing clients also periodically purchase additional training, consulting and minor programming services.\nProfessional services revenue increased 16% compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from recent acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Excluding the incremental impact of recent acquisitions, professional services revenue increased 8%. The increase in professional services revenue is primarily attributed to higher revenues generated by the continued COVID pandemic-related rent relief services and the return of billable travel revenue as onsite services have increased since 2021. The increases are partially offset by more clients selecting our cloud solutions instead of our on-premises license arrangements which typically require more professional services.\n34\nSoftware licenses and royalties.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nSoftware licenses and royalties revenue decreased 20% compared to the prior period. The decline is primarily attributed to the shift in the mix of new software contracts toward more subscription-based agreements compared to the prior period.\nAlthough the mix of new contracts between subscription-based and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year, we expect the decline in software license revenues will accelerate as we continue to shift our model away from perpetual licenses to SaaS. Subscription-based arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract.\nAppraisal services.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nIn 2022, appraisal services revenue grew 24% compared to the prior period primarily due to relaxed travel restrictions allowing for the ramp-up of appraisal services\nfor several new revaluation contracts which started in recent quarters. The appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states.\nCost of revenues and gross margins\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\n35\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended December 31:\nGross margin percentage by revenue type, excluding the incremental impact of recent acquisitions\n2\n, for the years ended December 31:\nSubscriptions, maintenance, and professional services\n. Cost of subscriptions, maintenance and professional services primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software, conversion of client data, training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development, on-going operation of SaaS, digital government, and other transaction-based services such as e-filing. Other costs included are interchange fees required to process credit/debit card transactions and bank fees to process automated clearinghouse transactions related to our payments business. In 2022, the subscriptions, maintenance and professional services gross margin declined 0.9% compared to the prior period primarily due to several factors, including lower maintenance revenue resulting from attrition related to a legacy case management solution; a post-COVID return of low-margin revenues such as billable travel; higher personnel costs related to inflation, as well as costs related to onboarding new professional services employees who are not yet billable; and higher hosting costs related to our accelerated shift to the cloud. Our implementation and support staff grew by 225 employees since December 31, 2021, as we increased hiring to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business. Excluding the incremental impact from recent acquisitions of $70 million, gross margin was 45.8% in 2022, a slight increase of 0.2% which is attributable to an increase in SaaS arrangements and the decline in low margin COVID-related transaction-based revenues compared to the prior period.\nSoftware licenses, royalties, software development, and acquired software\n. Amortization expense for acquired software comprises the majority of costs of software licenses, royalties, software development, and acquired software. We do not have any direct costs associated with royalties. The gross margin for software licenses, royalties, software development, and acquired software was negative 9.0% in 2022 and 30.9% in 2021. Excluding the impact of amortization expense of acquired software, the margin was 78.8% in 2022 and 92.1% in 2021. The decline in software licenses, royalties, software development, and acquired software gross margin compared to the prior period is due to lower revenue from software licenses.\nAppraisal services\n. Appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 1.9% of total revenues. The appraisal services gross margin decrease of 0.9% compared to 2021 is primarily due to higher personnel costs related to inflation, as well as increased low margin billable travel revenue. The appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states.\nOverall gross margin\n. Our 2022 blended gross margin decreased 2.2% compared to 2021, principally due to the inclusion of NIC’s revenues (including lower margin COVID related revenues), which historically have lower margins than Tyler’s software-related revenues. Excluding the incremental impact from recent acquisitions of $60 million, overall gross margin was 43.8% in 2022. The decrease of 0.8% in overall gross margin compared to the prior period is due to lower revenue from software licenses and maintenance, higher hosting costs related to our accelerated shift to the cloud, and higher personnel costs. Excluding employees from recent acquisitions, our implementation and support, and appraisal staff grew by 219 employees since December 31, 2021, as we increased hiring to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business.\n36\nSales and marketing expense\nSales and Marketing expense (“S&M”) consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, share-based compensation expense, commissions and related overhead costs for sales and marketing employees, as well as professional fees, trade show activities, advertising costs and other marketing costs. The following table sets forth a comparison of our S&M expenses for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nS&M as a percentage of revenue was 7.3% in 2022 compared to 7.4% in 2021. S&M expense increased approximately 14% compared to the prior period, primarily due to the inclusion of recent acquisitions’ S&M expense. Excluding the incremental impact of S&M expense from recent acquisitions of $5.6 million, S&M increased 10% compared to the prior period. Higher S&M expense is due to higher bonus and commission expense relating to improved operating results, increase in road show and user conference expenses, increase in travel-related expenses, and higher sales and marketing personnel costs from increased employee headcount.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expense consists primarily of personnel salaries and share-based compensation expense for general corporate functions, including senior management, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and corporate development, third party professional fees, travel-related expenses, insurance, allocation of depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, acquisition-related expenses and other administrative expenses. The following table sets forth a comparison of our G&A expense for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nG&A as a percentage of revenue was 14.4% in 2022 compared to 17.1% in 2021. G&A expense decreased approximately 2% compared to the prior period. The decrease in G&A is primarily attributed to lower transaction costs related to recent acquisitions and lower share-based compensation expense. G&A includes $2.0 million of transaction expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2022 compared to $23.5 million of transaction expense related to acquisitions completed in 2021. During 2022, stock compensation expense declined $5.5 million compared to 2021, generally due to a lower fair value of each share-based award resulting from the decline in our stock price. The decreases are offset by inclusion of G&A expense from acquisitions of $21.5 million, higher bonus expense due to improved operating results, increases in amortization of software development for internal use, increases in travel-related expenses and other administrative costs, and higher personnel costs from increased employee headcount. In 2022, G&A expense also included $2.8 million related to lease restructuring and other asset write-offs.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development. The following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nResearch and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate significant revenue.\nResearch and development expense as a percent of total revenue was 5.7% in 2022 compared to 5.9% in 2021. Research and development expense increased 13% in 2022 compared to the prior period, mainly due to a number of new Tyler product development initiatives across our product suites, including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses.\n37\nAmortization of other intangibles\nOther intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that are allocated to acquired software and customer related, trade name, and leases acquired intangibles. The remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense. The estimated useful lives of other intangibles range from one to 25 years. The following table sets forth a comparison of our amortization of other intangibles for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nAmortization of other intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several acquisitions completed in 2022 and 2021.\nEstimated annual amortization expense relating to customer related, trade name, and acquired lease intangibles, excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues, for the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):\nInterest expense\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our interest expense for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nInterest expense is comprised of interest expense and non-usage and other fees associated with our borrowings\n.\nThe change in interest expense compared to the prior period is attributable to an increase in amortization expense related to debt issuance costs, resulting from our accelerated repayment of the term loans, coupled with an increase in interest rates compared to the prior period.\nOther income, net\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our other income, net for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nOther income, net, is primarily comprised of interest income from invested cash. The change in other income, net, compared to the prior period is due to increased interest income generated from invested cash as a result of higher interest rates in 2022 compared to 2021.\n38\nIncome tax provision\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended December 31 ($ in thousands):\nThe increase in the income tax provision and the effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to the prior period is principally driven by a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and an increase in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, offset by an increase in research tax credit benefits. The share-based exercise and vesting activity in 2022 generated $7.8 million of excess tax benefits, while exercise and vesting activity in 2021 generated $47.7 million of excess tax benefits. The tax benefits related to research tax credits totaled $31.3 million in 2022 compared to $5.0 million in 2021, as a result of completing a multiyear research and development tax credit study during 2022.\nThe effective income tax rates for the periods presented were different from the statutory United States federal income tax rate of 21% primarily due to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and the tax benefits of research tax credits, offset by an increase in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, state income taxes, and non-deductible business expenses. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits, uncertain tax positions and research credits, our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2022 would have been $54.1 million and 28.8%, respectively, and in 2021, would have been $50.6 million and 31.8%, respectively.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $173.9 million compared to $309.2 million at December 31, 2021. We also had $55.5 million invested in investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities as of December 31, 2022, compared to $98.7 million at December 31, 2021. These investments have varying maturity dates through 2027 and are held as available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2022, we had $395.0 million outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Credit Agreement and one outstanding letter of credit totaling $1.5 million in favor of a client contract. We believe our cash on hand, cash from operating activities, availability under our revolving line of credit, and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our long-term financial needs.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\nNet cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. Other potential capital resources include cash on hand, public and private issuances of debt or equity securities, and bank borrowings. It is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors. We currently believe that our cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.\nIn 2022, operating activities provided cash of $381.5 million compared to $371.8 million in 2021. Operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of $164.2 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of $159.1 million, non-cash share-based compensation expense of $103.0 million and non-cash amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $13.0 million. Working capital, excluding cash, decreased approximately $60.6 million mainly due to timing of payments to and receipts from our government partners, timing of payments of payroll related taxes and vendor invoices, and deferred taxes associated with tax research credits and stock option activity during the period. These decreases were offset by the timing of tax payments, prepaid expenses, and increase in deferred revenue during the period. In general, changes in deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings. Our renewal dates occur throughout the year, but our largest renewal billing cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters. Subscription renewals are billed throughout the year.\n39\nDays sales outstanding (DSO) in accounts receivable were 115 days at December 31, 2022, compared to 108 days at December 31, 2021. DSO is calculated based on quarter-end accounts receivable divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days. The increase in DSO compared to December 31, 2021, is attributed to slower payments from certain large clients and timing of receipts from our government partners.\nInvesting activities used cash of $172.5 million in 2022 compared to $2.1 billion in 2021. On October 31, 2022, we acquired Rapid Financial Solutions, LLC, for the\ntotal purchase price, net of\ncash acquired of $2.2 million, of approximately $67.7 million, consisting of $51.2 million paid in cash, $18.2 million of common stock, and $500,000 related to working capital holdbacks, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. On May 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Quatred, LLC for the total cash price of approximately $637,000.\nOn February 8, 2022, we acquired US eDirect Inc, for the total purchase price, net of\ncash acquired of $6.4 million, of approximately $116.5 million, consisting of $118.8 million paid in cash and approximately $4.1 million related to indemnity holdbacks. During 2022, we also paid approximately $1.9 million in indemnity and working capital holdbacks related to acquisitions completed in late 2021. In addition, approximately $27.6 million of software development costs were capitalized. Approximately $22.5 million was invested in property and equipment, including $4.5 million related to real estate. The remaining additions were for computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of growth, particularly with respect to data centers supporting growth in our cloud-based offerings.\nInvesting activities used cash of $2.1 billion in 2021. We invested $77.5 million and received $131.4 million in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities with maturity dates ranging from 2022 through 2027. On March 31, 2021, we completed two acquisitions with the total purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $12.1 million paid in cash. On April 21, 2021, we completed the acquisition of NIC for the total purchase price of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired of $331.8 million, including cash paid of $2.3 billion and $1.9 million of purchase consideration related to the conversion of unvested restricted stock awards. On September 1, 2021, we acquired VendEngine for the total purchase price, net of cash acquired of $1.7 million, of approximately $83.8 million consisting of $80.2 million paid in cash and approximately $5.4 million related to indemnity holdbacks, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. On September 9, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest of Arx for the total purchase price, net of cash acquired, of approximately $12.8 million, of which $12.3 million was paid in cash and approximately $500,000 was accrued for indemnity holdbacks. Approximately $33.9 million was invested in property and equipment, including $12.8 million related to real estate. In addition, approximately $21.7 million of software development was capitalized in 2021. The remaining additions were for computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth, with the majority associated with our data centers supporting growth in our cloud-based offerings. These expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations.\nFinancing activities used cash of $344.2 million in 2022 compared to cash provided of $1.4 billion in 2021, primarily attributable to repayment of $360.0 million of term debt, partially offset by payments received from stock option exercises, net of withheld shares for taxes upon equity award and employee stock purchase plan activity.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $1.4 billion in 2021. Financing activities in 2021 were primarily comprised of proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2021 Credit Agreement. On March 9, 2021, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes were $591.4 million, net of initial purchasers’ discounts of $6.0 million and debt issuance costs of $2.6 million. On April 21, 2021, in connection with the completion of the NIC acquisition, the Company, as borrower, entered into a new 2021 Credit Agreement with various lenders consisting of an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $500.0 million and unsecured term loans totaling $900.0 million. The net proceeds from the borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement were $1.1 billion, net of debt discounts of $7.2 million and debt issuance costs of $4.9 million and $6.4 million of commitment fees paid related to the terminated $1.6 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we repaid $250.0 million of the unsecured revolving credit facility and $145.0 million of the term debt. The remainder of the financing activities was comprised of receipts of $109.9 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity. We also purchased approximately 33,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $13.0 million.\nIn February 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1.5 million shares of our common stock. The repurchase program, which was approved by our board of directors, was originally announced in October 2002 and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2019. As of February 22, 2023, we have authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion. Market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased, as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises. Share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions, privately negotiated transactions and/or other mechanisms. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time.\n40\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $600 million in outstanding principal for the Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. Under our 2021 Credit Agreement, we had $395 million in outstanding principal for the Term Loans, no outstanding borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, and an available borrowing capacity of $500 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had one outstanding letter of credit totaling $1.5 million. The letter of credit, which guarantees our performance under a client contract, renews automatically annually unless canceled in writing and expires in the third quarter of 2026. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid $360 million of the Term Loans under 2021 Credit Agreement.\nWe paid interest of $21.3 million in 2022, $17.7 million in 2021, including $6.4 million related to the senior unsecured bridge loan facility commitment fee in 2021, and $610,000 in 2020. See Note 6, “Debt,” to the consolidated financial statements for discussions of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2021 Credit Agreement.\nWe paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $38.5 million in 2022, $2.2 million in 2021, and $3.3 million in 2020. In 2022, stock option exercise activity generated net tax benefits of $7.8 million and reduced tax payments accordingly, as compared to $47.7 million and $60.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for research activities performed in the United States and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States pursuant to IRC Section 174. Although Congress is considering legislation that would repeal or defer this capitalization and amortization requirement, it is not certain that this provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or replaced, it will increase our U.S. federal and state cash tax payments and reduce cash flows in fiscal year 2023 and future years.\nWe anticipate that 2023 capital spending will be between $68 million and $70 million, including approximately $16 million related to real estate and approximately $37 million of software development. We expect the majority of the other capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion. We also expect cash tax payments to be higher as a result of IRC Section 174. Capital spending and cash tax payments are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.\nFrom time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. In order to pursue such opportunities, which could require significant commitments of capital, we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed.\nWe lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation and other equipment. Most of our leases are non-cancelable operating lease agreements and they expire from one to 12 years. Some of these leases include options to extend for up to six years.\nOur estimated future obligations consist of debt, uncertain tax positions, leases, and purchase commitments as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 6, “Debt,” Note 10, “Income Tax,” Note 14, “Leases,” and Note 16, “Commitment and Contingencies,” to the consolidated financial statements for related discussions.\nCAPITALIZATION\nAt December 31, 2022, our capitalization consisted of $987.4 million of outstanding debt and $2.6 billion of shareholders’ equity."

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nDallas, Texas\nFebruary 22, 2023\nF-3\nTyler Technologies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nFor the years ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nF-4\nTyler Technologies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFor the years ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nF-5\nTyler Technologies, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except par value and share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nF-6\nTyler Technologies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFor the years ended December 31\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nF-7\nF-8\nTyler Technologies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nF-9\nTyler Technologies, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tables in thousands, except per share data)\n(1)\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nWe provide integrated software systems and related services for the public sector. We develop and market a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology (“IT”) needs primarily of cities, counties, states, schools, federal agencies, and other government entities. We provide subscription-based services such as software as a service (“SaaS”), transaction-based fees primarily related to digital government services and online payment processing, and electronic document filing solutions (“e-filing”), which simplify the filing and management of court related documents. In addition, we provide professional IT services, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training, and for certain customers, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems. Additionally, we provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements include our parent company and\n62\nsubsidiaries, which are wholly-owned. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources and includes all components of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we had approximately $\n798,000\nof other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, from our available-for-sale investment holdings. We did\nnot\nhave material items of other comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020.\nRECLASSIFICATIONS\nCertain amounts for previous years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. We have elected to present amortization of software development, previously included in the cost of revenues software licenses and royalties line item, in a separate category line item on the consolidated statements of income for all reporting periods presented. We also have elected to present sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense, previously disclosed as selling, general, and administrative expense, as separate category line items on the consolidated statements of income for all reporting periods presented.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash in excess of that necessary for operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments. Investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on deposit with several banks and money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNature of Products and Services\nWe earn revenues from subscription-based services, post-contract customer support (“PCS” or “maintenance”), professional services, software licenses and royalties, appraisal services, and hardware and other. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n•\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n•\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n•\nDetermination of the transaction price\n•\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n•\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\nF-10\nOur software arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations that range from software licenses, installation, training, and consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs (services), hosting, and PCS. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately when they are distinct. We evaluate whether separate performance obligations can be distinct or should be accounted for as one performance obligation. Arrangements that include professional services, such as training or installation, are evaluated to determine whether those services are highly interdependent or interrelated to the product’s functionality. The transaction price is allocated to the distinct performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. We determine the SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, and the number and types of users within our contracts. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for sales adjustments and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nSubscription-Based Services:\nSubscription-based services consist primarily of revenue derived from SaaS arrangements, digital government services, payment processing, and e-filing. For SaaS arrangements, we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer’s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third-party to host the software. We allocate contract value to each performance obligation of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a distinct element based on estimated SSP. We recognize SaaS services ratably over the term of the arrangement, which range from\none\nto\n10\nyears, but are typically for a period of\nthree\nto\nfive years\n. For professional services associated with certain SaaS arrangements, we have concluded that the services are not distinct, and we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nTransaction-based fees primarily relate to digital government services and online payment services, which are sometimes offered with the assistance of third-party vendors. In general, when we are the principal in a transaction, we record the revenue and related costs on a gross basis. Otherwise, we net the cost of revenue associated with the service against the gross revenue (amount billed to the customer) and record the net amount as revenue.\nE-filing transaction fees primarily pertain to documents filed with the courts by attorneys and other third-parties via our e-filing services and retrieval of filed documents via our access services. For each document filed with a court, the filer generally pays a transaction fee and a court filing fee to us and we remit a portion of the transaction fee and the filing fee to the court. We record as revenue the transaction fee, while the portion of the transaction fee remitted to the courts is recorded as cost of revenues as we are acting as an agent in the arrangement. Court filing fees collected on behalf of the courts and remitted to the courts are recorded on a net basis and thus do not affect our consolidated statements of income.\nFor e-filing transaction fees and transaction-based revenues from digital government services and online payments, we have the right to charge the customer an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date. Therefore, we recognize revenues for these services over time based on the amount billable to the customer. In some cases, we are paid on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenue ratably over the contractual period. Typically, the structure of our arrangements does not give rise to variable consideration. However, in those instances whereby variable consideration exists, we include in our estimates, additional revenues for variable consideration when we believe we have an enforceable right, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable.\nCosts of performing services under subscription-based arrangements are expensed as incurred, except for certain direct and incremental contract origination and set-up costs associated with SaaS arrangements. Such direct and incremental costs are capitalized and amortized ratably over the period of benefit.\nSoftware Arrangements:\nSoftware Licenses and Royalties\nMany of our software arrangements involve “off-the-shelf” software. We recognize the revenue allocable to “off-the-shelf” software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer, unless the software is not considered distinct. We consider \"off-the-shelf\" software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code, it can be used by the customer for the customer’s purpose upon installation, and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or interrelated to the product's functionality.\nF-11\nFor arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where professional services are otherwise not considered distinct, we recognize revenue over time by measuring progress-to-completion. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. These arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.\nSoftware license fees are billed in accordance with the contract terms. Typically, a majority of the fee is due when access to the software license is made available to the customer and the remainder of the fee due over a passage of time stipulated by the contract. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nWe recognize royalty revenue when the sale occurs under the terms of our third-party royalty arrangements. Currently, our third-party royalties are recognized on an estimated basis and adjusted if needed, when we receive notice of amounts we are entitled to receive. We typically receive notice of royalty revenue we are entitled to and amounts are billed on a quarterly basis in the quarter immediately following the royalty reporting period, and adjustments have not been significant.\nProfessional Services\nAs noted above, some of our software arrangements include services considered highly interdependent or highly interrelated or require significant customization to meet the customer's desired functionality. For these software arrangements, both the software licenses and related professional services revenue are not distinct and are recognized over time using the progress-to-completion method. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Contract fees are typically billed on a milestone basis as defined within contract terms. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. When professional services are distinct, the fee allocable to the service element is recognized over the time we perform the services and is billed on a time and material basis.\nPost-Contract Customer Support\nOur customers generally enter into PCS agreements when they purchase our software licenses. PCS includes telephone support, bug fixes, and rights to upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. PCS is considered distinct when purchased with our software licenses. Our PCS agreements are typically renewable annually. PCS is recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the period the PCS is provided. All significant costs and expenses associated with PCS are expensed as incurred.\nComputer Hardware Equipment\nRevenue allocable to computer hardware equipment is recognized at a point in time when control of the equipment is transferred to the customer.\nAppraisal Services:\nFor our property appraisal projects, we recognize revenue using the progress-to-completion method since many of these projects are executed over\none\nto\nthree-year\nperiods and consist of various unique activities. Appraisal services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with various individual service components; therefore, the service components are not considered distinct. Appraisal services are recognized over time by measuring progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. These arrangements are often executed over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent. Contract fees are typically billed on a milestone basis as defined within contract terms. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nF-12\nSignificant Judgments:\nOur contracts with customers often include multiple performance obligations to a customer. When a software arrangement (license or subscription) includes both software licenses and professional services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the professional services and recognized over time.\nThe transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. We determine the SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nWe use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine SSP using the expected cost-plus margin approach.\nFor arrangements that involve significant production, modification, or customization of the software, or where professional services otherwise cannot be considered distinct, we recognize revenue as control is transferred to the customer over time using progress-to-completion methods. Depending on the contract, we measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred, or value added. The progress-to-completion method generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract because we can provide reasonably dependable estimates of contract billings and contract costs. These arrangements are often implemented over an extended time period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent.\nRefer to Note 18 - \"Disaggregation of Revenue” for further information, including the economic factors that affect the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows of our various revenue categories.\nContract Balances:\nAccounts receivable and allowance for losses and sales adjustments\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record an unbilled receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or deferred revenue when invoicing occurs prior to revenue recognition. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record an unbilled receivable related to revenue recognized for on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\nIn connection with our appraisal services contracts and certain professional services contracts, we may perform work prior to when the software and services are billable and/or payable pursuant to the contract. Unbilled revenue is not billable at the balance sheet date but is recoverable over the remaining life of the contract through billings made in accordance with contractual agreements. The termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered or services performed in the event of early termination. We have historically recorded such unbilled receivables (costs and estimated profit in excess of billings) in connection with (1) property appraisal services contracts accounted for using progress-to-completion method of revenue recognition using labor hours as a measure of progress towards completion in which the services are performed in one accounting period but the billing normally occurs subsequently and may span another accounting period; (2) professional services contracts accounted for using progress-to-completion method of revenue recognition using labor hours as a measure of progress towards completion in which the services are performed in one accounting period but the billing for the software element of the arrangement may be based upon the specific phase of the implementation; (3) software revenue for which we have recognized revenue at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer; (4) some of our contracts which provide for an amount to be withheld from a progress billing (generally between\n5\n% and\n15\n% retention) until final and satisfactory project completion is achieved; and (5) in a limited number of cases, extended payment terms, which may be granted to customers with whom we generally have a long-term relationship and favorable collection history.\nAs of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, total current and long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for losses and sales adjustments, was $\n585.5\nmillion and $\n535.0\nmillion, respectively. We have recorded unbilled receivables of $\n135.4\nmillion and $\n140.3\nmillion at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Included in unbilled receivables are retention receivables of $\n8.6\nmillion and $\n7.7\nmillion at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively, which become payable upon the completion of the contract or completion of our fieldwork and formal hearings. Unbilled receivables expected to be collected within one year have been included with accounts receivable, current portion in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Unbilled receivables and retention receivables expected to be collected past one year have been included with accounts receivable, long-term portion in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nF-13\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within\n30\nto\n90\ndays. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises term licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\nWe maintain allowances for losses and sales adjustments, which losses are recorded against revenue at the time the loss is incurred. Since most of our clients are domestic governmental entities, we rarely incur a credit loss resulting from the inability of a client to make required payments. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount for the allowances for losses and sales adjustments may require revision, include, but are not limited to, managing our client’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products. Our allowance for losses and sales adjustments of $\n14.8\nmillion and $\n12.1\nmillion at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Because we rarely experience credit losses with our clients, we have not recorded a material reserve for credit losses.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the allowance for losses and sales adjustments:\nDeferred Revenue\nThe majority of deferred revenue consists of deferred subscription-based services revenue that has been billed based on contractual terms in the underlying arrangement, with the remaining balance consisting of payments received in advance of revenue being earned under maintenance, software licensing, software and appraisal services, and hardware installation. Refer to Note 19 - \"Deferred Revenue and Performance Obligations\" for further information, including deferred revenue by segment and changes in deferred revenue during the period.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized commensurate with the recognition of associated revenue over a period of benefit that we have determined to be\nthree\nto\nseven years\n. We utilized the “portfolio approach” practical expedient, which allows entities to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics because the effects on the financial statements of this approach would not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. Using the “portfolio approach”, we determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life-cycle and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are generally not paid in connection with the renewal of a contract. In the small number of instances where a commission is paid on a renewal, it is not commensurate with the commission paid on the initial sale and is recognized over the term of renewal, which is generally\none year\n. Amortization expense related to deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 20 - “Deferred Commissions” for further information.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets include direct and incremental costs such as commissions associated with arrangements for which revenue recognition has been deferred. Such costs are expensed at the time the related revenue is recognized.\nF-14\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, determining the SSP of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as returns and refunds; loss contingencies; the estimated useful life of deferred commissions; the fair value amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets; the carrying amount of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities; determining share-based compensation expense; the allowance for losses and sales adjustments; and determining the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from estimates.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty, equipment and purchased software are recorded at original cost and increased by the cost of any significant improvements after purchase. We expense maintenance and repairs when incurred. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the asset’s estimated useful life or the term of the lease in the case of leasehold improvements. For income tax purposes, we use accelerated depreciation methods as allowed by tax laws.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nWe expensed research and development expense of\n$\n105.2\nmillion in 2022, $\n93.5\nmillion in 2021, and $\n88.4\nmillion in 2020.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as “temporary differences”. We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets” (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities” (generally items that we received a tax deduction for, which have not yet been recorded in the income statement). The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rules and laws that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be \"realized\".\nWe do not recognize a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions unless management’s assessment concludes that it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit based upon the largest amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not probable, determined by cumulative probability, of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nInternal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 174\nFor the tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for research activities performed in the United States and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States pursuant to IRC Section 174. Although Congress is considering legislation that would repeal or defer this capitalization and amortization requirement, it is not certain that this provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not repealed or replaced, it will increase our U.S. federal and state cash tax payments and reduce cash flows in fiscal year 2023 and future years.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have a share-based award plan that provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. Stock options generally vest after\nthree\nto\nsix years\nof continuous service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of\n10\nyears. Restricted stock unit grants generally vest ratably over\nthree\nto\nfive years\nof continuous service from the date of grant. Each performance share unit represents the right to receive\none\nshare of our common stock based on our achievement of certain financial performance targets during applicable performance periods, which generally cliff vest in one or three years. We account for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition pursuant to ASC 718,\nStock Compensation\n. See Note 12, “Share-Based Compensation,” for further information.\nF-15\nBUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nAccounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. The determination of fair value requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, and in making these determinations, management uses all available information.\nFor tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, management estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include, but are not limited to, discount rates, future revenues and operating costs, projections of capital costs, and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.\nDue to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the closing date. If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination as well as the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nSee Note 2, “Acquisitions,” for further information.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below. When testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively, we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions (Level 3 inputs). The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization.\nDuring the fourth quarter, as part of our annual impairment test as of October 1, we performed qualitative assessments for the reporting units containing the recently acquired data and insights, digital government and payments solutions, and development platform solutions, and concluded no impairment existed as of our annual assessment date. Approximately $\n1.7\nbillion, or\n70\n%, of total goodwill as of December 31, 2022, relates to these reporting units, which as a result of these recent acquisitions, do not have significant excess fair values over carrying values. We performed qualitative assessments for the remaining reporting units in which we determined that it not more likely than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value; therefore, we did not perform a Step 1 quantitative impairment test. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. During 2022, we have recorded no impairment to goodwill as no triggering events or change in circumstances indicating a potential impairment has occurred as of period-end.\nDetermining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Changes in market conditions or other factors outside of our control could cause us to change key assumptions and our judgment about a reporting unit’s prospects. Similarly, in a specific period, a reporting unit could significantly underperform relative to its historical or projected future operating results. Either situation could result in a meaningfully different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, and a consequent future impairment charge.\nThere have been\nno\nimpairments to goodwill in any of the periods presented. See Note 4, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" for additional information.\nF-16\nOther Intangible Assets\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Customer base and acquired software each comprise approximately half of our purchased intangible assets other than goodwill. We review our customer turnover each year for indications of impairment. Our customer turnover has historically been very low. If indications of impairment are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. There have been\nno\nimpairments of intangible assets in any of the periods presented.\nIMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nWe periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our property and equipment or other long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or appropriate grouping of assets and the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. There was\nno\nimpairment of long-lived assets in any of the periods presented.\nCOSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE\nWe capitalize software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the availability of the product for general release to customers for software sold to third parties and for application development costs of software developed for internal use. Software development costs primarily consist of personnel costs. During the twelve months period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, we capitalized approximately $\n27.6\nmillion and $\n21.7\nmillion of software development costs. We begin to amortize capitalized costs when a product is available for general release to customers and internal use software is ready for its intended use. Amortization expense is determined on a product-by-product basis at a rate not less than straight-line basis over the software’s remaining estimated economic life of, generally,\nthree\nto\nfive years\n.\nCONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION\nContingent future cash payments related to acquisitions are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and included in the determination of the acquisition date purchase price. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent future cash payments are recognized in earnings in the period that the change occurs.\nWe have no contingent consideration outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable from trade customers, and investments in marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of operating account balances and money market funds, which are maintained at several major domestic financial institutions and the balances often exceed insured amounts. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $\n173.9\nmillion. We perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of these financial institutions.\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the size and geographical diversity of our customer base. As a result, we do not believe we have any significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2022.\nWe maintain allowances for losses and sales adjustments, which losses are recorded against revenues at the time the loss is incurred. Since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities, we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount for the allowances for losses and sales adjustments may require revision include, but are not limited to, failure to manage our customer’s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products. Historically, our credit losses have not been significant.\nLEASES\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and operating lease liabilities, current and long-term, on our consolidated balance sheets. We currently do not have any finance lease arrangements.\nF-17\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component.\nINDEMNIFICATION\nMost of our software license agreements indemnify our customers in the event that the software sold infringes upon the intellectual property rights of a third-party. These agreements typically provide that in such event we will either modify or replace the software so that it becomes non-infringing or procure for the customer the right to use the software. We have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications, as we are not aware of any pending or threatened infringement actions that are possible losses. We believe the estimated fair value of these intellectual property indemnification clauses is minimal.\nWe have also agreed to indemnify certain officers and our board members if they are named or threatened to be named as a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that they acted in such capacity. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage to protect against any such losses. We have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnifications. Because of our insurance coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08 -\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n(ASC 805) (“ASU 2021-08”). ASU 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. Under this \"Topic 606 approach,\" the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the contracts. This is a departure from the current requirement to measure contract assets and contract liabilities at fair value. ASU 2021-08 is effective for all public business entities in annual and interim periods starting after December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. An entity that early adopts should apply the amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. We early adopted as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not result in an adjustment to the fair value of the deferred revenue balances assumed in our 2022 acquisitions. See Note 2, “Acquisitions,” for further discussion.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThere were no new not yet adopted accounting pronouncements currently issued that would affect the Company or have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods.\n(2)\nACQUISITIONS\n2022\nOn October 31, 2022, we acquired Rapid Financial Solutions, LLC (Rapid), a provider of reliable, scalable, and secure payments with best-in-class card issuance and digital disbursement capabilities.\nThe total purchase price, net of\ncash acquired of $\n2.2\nmillion, was approximately $\n67.7\nmillion, consisting of $\n51.2\nmillion paid in cash, $\n18.2\nmillion of common stock, and $\n500,000\nrelated to working capital holdbacks, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nWe have performed a preliminary valuation analysis of the fair market value of Rapid’s assets and liabilities. In connection with this transaction, we acquired total tangible assets of $\n2.9\nmillion and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n635,000\n. We recorded goodwill of approximately $\n40.0\nmillion, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and other identifiable intangible assets of approximately $\n27.6\nmillion. The goodwill arising from this acquisition is primarily attributed to our ability to generate increased revenues, earnings and cash flow by expanding our addressable market and client base. The $\n27.6\nmillion of intangible assets are attributable to customer relationships, acquired software, and trade name and will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately\n10\nyears.\nOn May 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Quatred, LLC (Quatred), a systems integrator and barcode technology solutions provider. The total cash price was approximately $\n637,000\n.\nF-18\nOn February 8, 2022, we acquired US eDirect Inc. (US eDirect), a leading provider of technology solutions for campground and outdoor recreation management. The total purchase price, net of\ncash acquired of $\n6.4\nmillion, was approximately $\n116.5\nmillion, consisting of $\n118.8\nmillion paid in cash and approximately $\n4.1\nmillion related to indemnity holdbacks.\nWe have performed a valuation analysis of the fair market value of US eDirect's assets and liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price as of the acquisition date:\nIn connection with this transaction, we acquired total tangible assets of $\n9.4\nmillion and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n3.7\nmillion. We recorded goodwill of approximately $\n91.4\nmillion, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and other identifiable intangible assets of approximately $\n34.1\nmillion. The goodwill arising from this acquisition is primarily attributed to our ability to generate increased revenues, earnings, and cash flow by expanding our addressable market and client base. The identifiable intangible assets are attributable to customer relationships, acquired software, and trade name and will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately\n13\nyears. We recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $\n8.3\nmillion related to the tax effect of our estimated fair value allocations. Since the acquisition date, we recorded adjustments to the preliminary opening balance sheet attributed to decreases in other current assets, other noncurrent assets, identifiable intangible assets, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue, and increases in accounts receivable, accounts payable, and deferred tax liabilities, resulting in a net increase to goodwill of approximately $\n10.3\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the purchase price allocations for US eDirect and Quatred are complete, while the purchase price allocation for Rapid is not final; therefore, certain preliminary valuation estimates of fair value assumed at the acquisition date for intangible assets, receivables, and related deferred taxes are subject to change as valuations are finalized. Our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired are based on valuations using Level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nRapid and US eDirect are operated as a part of the digital government and payments solutions business unit (also known as the NIC division),\ntherefore the following unaudited pro forma consolidated operating results information has been prepared as if the acquisitions of Rapid and US eDirect had occurred on January 1, 2021, and NIC had occurred on January 1, 2020, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of intangibles, transaction costs, and tax effects.\nThe pro forma information above does not include acquisitions that are not considered material to our results of operations. The pro forma information does not purport to represent what our results of operations actually would have been had such transaction occurred on the date specified or to project our results of operations for any future period.\nF-19\nThe actual operating results of Rapid, US eDirect, and NIC from their respective dates of acquisition are included with the operating results of the Platform Technologies segment. The operating results of Quatred are included in the operating results of the Enterprise Software segment since the date of acquisition. The impact of the 2022 acquisitions on our operating results, assets, and liabilities is not material. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we incurred fees of approximately $\n2.0\nmillion for financial advisory, legal, accounting, due diligence, valuation, and other various services necessary to complete acquisitions. These costs were expensed in 2022 and are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n2021\nOn September 9, 2021, we acquired all the equity interest of Ultimate Information Systems, Inc. (dba Arx). Arx is a cloud-based platform which creates accessible technology to enable a modern-day police force that is fully transparent, accountable, and a trusted resource to the community it serves. The total purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $\n12.8\nmillion.\nOn September 1, 2021, we acquired VendEngine, Inc., a cloud-based software provider focused on financial technology for the corrections market. The total purchase price, net of cash acquired of $\n1.7\nmillion, was approximately $\n83.6\nmillion, consisting of $\n81.6\nmillion paid in cash, and approximately $\n3.8\nmillion related to indemnity holdbacks.\nIn connection with this transaction, we acquired total tangible assets of $\n5.8\nmillion and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n3.0\nmillion. We recorded goodwill of approximately $\n54.3\nmillion, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and other identifiable intangible assets of approximately $\n37.9\nmillion. The $\n37.9\nmillion of intangible assets are attributable to customer relationships, acquired software, and trade name and will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately\n13\nyears. We recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $\n9.6\nmillion related to the tax effect of our estimated fair value allocations. In the twelve months ended December 31, we recorded adjustments to the preliminary opening balance sheet attributed to a decrease to accounts receivable, accounts payable, deferred income taxes, and an adjustment to the accrual for indemnity holdbacks and increases in identifiable intangible assets and accrued expenses resulting in a net decrease to goodwill of approximately $\n4.4\nmillion.\nOn April 21, 2021, we acquired NIC, Inc., a leading digital government solutions and payment company that primarily serves federal and state government agencies. The total purchase price, net of cash acquired of $\n331.8\nmillion, was approximately $\n2.0\nbillion, consisting of cash paid of $\n2.3\nbillion and $\n1.9\nmillion of purchase consideration related to the conversion of unvested restricted stock awards.\nWe have performed the valuation analysis of the fair market value of NIC’s assets and liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price as of the acquisition date:\nIn connection with this transaction, we acquired total tangible assets of $\n515.3\nmillion and assumed liabilities of approximately $\n228.0\nmillion. We recorded goodwill of approximately $\n1.4\nbillion, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and other identifiable intangible assets of approximately $\n777.0\nmillion. The $\n777.0\nmillion of intangible assets are attributable to customer relationships, acquired software, and trade name and will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately\n17\nyears. We recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $\n190.6\nmillion related to the tax effect of our estimated fair value allocations. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded adjustments to the preliminary opening balance sheet attributed to a decrease to accounts receivable and increases in identifiable intangible assets, deferred revenue and related deferred taxes resulting in a net decrease to goodwill of approximately $\n17.2\nmillion.\nNIC delivers user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government-providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. In addition, NIC has extensive\nF-20\nexpertise and scale in the government payments arena which will accelerate our strategic payments initiatives\n.\nTherefore, the goodwill of approximately $\n1.4\nbillion arising from this acquisition is primarily attributed to our ability to generate increased revenues, earnings and cash flow by expanding our addressable market and client base.\nOn March 31, 2021, we acquired all the equity interest of Glass Arc, Inc. (dba ReadySub), a cloud-based platform that assists school districts with absence tracking, filling substitute teacher assignments, and automating essential payroll processes. The total cash price was approximately $\n6.2\nmillion, net of cash acquired.\nOn March 31, 2021, we acquired substantially all assets of DataSpec, Inc. (DataSpec), a provider of a SaaS solution that allows for secure electronic claims submission to the federal Department of Veterans Affairs and reporting capabilities, in addition to scheduling, calendaring, and payments. The total cash purchase price was approximately $\n5.8\nmillion.\nThe operating results of Arx, DataSpec, ReadySub, and VendEngine are included with the operating results of the Enterprise Software segment since their date of acquisition. The impact of the Arx, DataSpec, ReadySub, and VendEngine acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, on our operating results, assets and liabilities is not material. The operating results of NIC are included in the Platform Technologies Segment. Revenues from NIC included in Tyler's results of operations totaled approximately $\n368.9\nmillion and net income was approximately $\n37.2\nmillion from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2021. In 2021, we incurred fees of approximately $\n23.5\nmillion for financial advisory, legal, accounting, due diligence, valuation and other various services necessary to complete these acquisitions. The Company also incurred $\n1.6\nmillion of expense related to a separation agreement with NIC's former Chief Executive Officer. These costs were expensed in 2021 and are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2022, the purchase price allocations for 2021 acquisitions are complete.\n(3)\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, NET\nProperty and equipment, net consists of the following at December 31:\nDepreciation expense was $\n29.5\nmillion in 2022, $\n29.4\nmillion in 2021, and $\n25.5\nmillion in 2020.\nWe paid $\n4.5\nmillion and $\n12.8\nmillion for real estate and the expansion of existing facilities in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nSoftware development costs, net consists of the following at December 31:\nAmortization expense for software development costs is recorded to cost of revenues and general and administrative expense. Amortization expense for software development costs recorded to cost of revenues was $\n6.5\nmillion in 2022, $\n2.3\nmillion in 2021, and\nno\nexpense in 2020. Amortization expense for software development costs recorded to general and administrative expense was $\n1.4\nmillion in 2022,\nno\nexpense in 2021, and $\n1.2\nmillion in 2020.\nF-21\nEstimated annual amortization expense related to software development costs:\n(4)\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the two years ended December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nOther intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consists of the following at December 31:\nAmortization expense for acquired software is recorded to cost of revenues. Amortization expense for customer related intangibles, trade names and leases acquired is recorded to amortization of other intangibles. Total amortization expense for other intangibles was $\n113.9\nmillion in 2022, $\n90.8\nmillion in 2021, and $\n53.9\nmillion in 2020.\nF-22\nThe amortization periods of other intangible assets is summarized in the following table:\nEstimated annual amortization expense related to other intangibles:\n(5)\nACCRUED LIABILITIES\nAccrued liabilities consist of the following at December 31:\n(6)\nDEBT\nThe following table summarizes our total outstanding borrowings related to the 2021 Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes:\nF-23\n2021 Credit Agreement\nIn connection with the completion of the acquisition of NIC on April 21, 2021, we, as borrower, entered into a new $\n1.4\nbillion Credit Agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”) with the various lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Swingline Lender, and Issuing Lender. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for (1) a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n500\nmillion, including sub-facilities for standby letters of credit and swingline loans (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (2) an amortizing\nfive-year\nterm loan in the aggregate amount of $\n600\nmillion (the “Term Loan A-1”), and (3) a non-amortizing\nthree-year\nterm loan in the aggregate amount of $\n300\nmillion (the “Term Loan A-2”) and, together (the “Term Loans”). The 2021 Credit Agreement matures on April 20, 2026, and the loans may be prepaid at any time, without premium or penalty, subject to certain minimum amounts and payment of any LIBOR breakage costs. In addition to the required amortization payments on the Term Loan A-1 of\n5\n% annually, certain mandatory quarterly prepayments of the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Facility will be required (i) upon the issuance or incurrence of additional debt not otherwise permitted under the 2021 Credit Agreement and (ii) upon the occurrence of certain asset sales and insurance and condemnation recoveries, subject to certain thresholds, baskets, and reinvestment provisions as provided in the 2021 Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan A-1 bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate of either (1) the Administrative Agent’s prime commercial lending rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) (the “Base Rate”) plus a margin of\n0.125\n% to\n0.75\n% or (2) the one-, three-, six-, or, subject to approval by all lenders, twelve-month LIBOR rate plus a margin of\n1.125\n% to\n1.75\n%. The Term Loan A-2 bears interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate of either (1) the Base Rate plus a margin of\n0\n% to\n0.5\n% or (2) the one-, three-, six-, or, subject to approval by all lenders, twelve-month LIBOR rate plus a margin of\n0.875\n% to\n1.5\n%. The margin in each case is based upon the Company’s total net leverage ratio, as determined pursuant to the 2021 Credit Agreement. The 2021 Credit Agreement has customary benchmark replacement language with respect to the replacement of LIBOR once LIBOR becomes unavailable. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, currently\n0.25\n% per annum, ranging from\n0.15\n% to\n0.3\n% based upon the Company’s total net leverage ratio.\nLIBOR, the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, is currently anticipated to be phased out in June 2023 and is expected to transition to a new standard rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which will incorporate certain overnight repo market data collected from multiple data sets. In January 2023, we amended\n3\nour 2021 Credit Agreement to replace the LIBOR reference rate with the SOFR reference rate. Assuming that SOFR replaces LIBOR and is appropriately adjusted to equate to one-month LIBOR, we expect that there should be minimal impact on our operations.\nThe net proceeds from the borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement were $\n1.1\nbillion, net of debt discounts of $\n7.2\nmillion and debt issuance costs of $\n4.9\nmillion and $\n6.4\nmillion of commitment fees paid related to the terminated $\n1.6\nbillion unsecured bridge loan facility. On the Closing Date, the Company paid approximately $\n2.3\nbillion in cash for the purchase of NIC. The Term Loans of $\n900\nmillion and a portion of the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility, in the amount of $\n250\nmillion, together with cash available to the Company of $\n609\nmillion and the net proceeds of its Convertible Senior Notes of $\n594\nmillion, were used to complete the acquisition and pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition and the 2021 Credit Agreement. The remaining portion of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working capital requirements, acquisitions, and capital expenditures of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe 2021 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with those covenants.\nThe carrying amount is the par value of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans less the debt discount and debt issuance costs that are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the Term Loans. Interest expense is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n3\nThe foregoing is a summary of the amended terms and conditions of the 2021 Credit Agreement and not a complete description of the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated January 27,2023. Accordingly, the foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement attached to this Current Report on Form 10-K as\n, which is incorporated by reference.\nF-24\nConvertible Senior Notes due 2026\nOn March 9, 2021, we issued\n0.25\n% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of $\n600.0\nmillion (“the Convertible Senior Notes” or “the Notes”). The Convertible Senior Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of March 9, 2021, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes were $\n591.4\nmillion, net of initial purchasers’ discounts of $\n6.0\nmillion and debt issuance costs of $\n2.6\nmillion.\nThe Convertible Senior Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to our future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nThe Convertible Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of\n0.25\n% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2021. The Convertible Senior Notes mature on March 15, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted.\nBefore September 15, 2025, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes have the right to convert their Convertible Senior Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into common stock of Tyler Technologies, Inc. (referred to as “our common stock” herein) at the following times or circumstances:\n•\nduring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2021, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds\n130\n% of the conversion price for each of at least\n20\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) during the\n30\nconsecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;\n•\nduring the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (such five consecutive trading day period, the “Measurement Period”) if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, as determined following a request by their holder in accordance with the procedures in the Indenture, for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day;\n•\nupon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on our common stock, including but not limited to a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture);\n•\nupon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or\n•\non or after September 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, March 15, 2026.\nWith certain exceptions, upon a change of control or other fundamental change (both as defined in the Indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes), the holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may require us to repurchase all or part of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nAs of December 31, 2022, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Convertible Senior Notes to convert have been met.\nFrom and including September 15, 2025, holders of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will settle any conversions of the Convertible Senior Notes either entirely in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. However, upon conversion of any Convertible Senior Notes, the conversion value, which will be determined over an “Observation Period” (as defined in the Indenture) consisting of\n30\ntrading days, will be paid in cash up to at least the principal amount of the Notes being converted.\nThe initial conversion rate is 2.0266 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $\n493.44\nper share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\nThe Convertible Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 15, 2024 and on or before the 30th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price\nF-25\nequal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds\n130\n% of the conversion price of the Notes on (i) each of at least\n20\ntrading days, whether or not consecutive, during the\n30\nconsecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. In addition, calling any Note for redemption constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\nEffective Interest\nThe weighted average interest rates for the borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 were\n5.82\n% and\n0.25\n%, as of December 31, 2022, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the effective interest rates for our borrowings were\n3.79\n% and\n0.54\n% for the 2021 Credit Agreement and the Convertible Senior Notes, respectively. The following sets forth the interest expense recognized related to the borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes and is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income:\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had one outstanding standalone letter of credit totaling $\n1.5\nmillion. The letter of credit, which guarantees our performance under a client contract, renews automatically annually unless canceled in writing, and expires in the third quarter of 2026. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid $\n360\nmillion of the Term Loans under the 2021 Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the required annual maturities related to the 2021 Credit Agreement and the Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 were as follows:\n(7)\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following table presents our financial instruments:\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds with original maturity dates of three months or less, for which we determine fair value through quoted market prices.\nF-26\nOur available-for-sale securities were historically classified as held-to-maturity. Management determined that our investment portfolio would be transferred from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale, in order to have the flexibility to buy and sell investments and maximize cash liquidity for potential acquisitions or for debt repayments. Accordingly, our investment portfolio is now classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2022. Our available-for-sale investments primarily consist of investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and asset-backed securities with maturity dates through 2027. These investments are presented at fair value and are included in short-term investments and non-current investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses associated with the investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income. For our available-for-sale investments, we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that we would be required to sell before recovery of their cost basis.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have an accrued interest receivable balance of approximately $\n200,000\nwhich is included in accounts receivable, net. We do not measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables. We record any losses within the maturity period or at the time of sale of the investment and any write-offs to accrued interest receivables are recorded as a reduction to interest income in the period of the loss. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we have recorded\nno\ncredit losses for accrued interest receivables. Interest income and amortization of discounts and premiums are included in other income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table presents the components of our available-for-sale investments:\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have $\n37.0\nmillion of available-for-sale debt securities with contractual maturities of one year or less and $\n18.5\nmillion with contractual maturities great than one year. As of December 31, 2022,\n24\navailable-for-sale debt securities with a fair value of $\n25.8\nmillion have been in a loss position for one year or less and\n28\nsecurities with a fair value of $\n23.1\nmillion have been in a loss position for greater than one year.\nThe following table presents the activity on our available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investments:\nOur equity investments consist of an\n18\n% interest in BFTR, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bison Capital Partners V L.P. BFTR, LLC, a privately held Australian company specializing in digitizing the spoken word in court and legal proceedings. The investment in common stock is accounted for under the equity method because we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee; and as the securities do not have readily determinable fair values, our investment is carried at cost less any impairment write-downs.\nF-27\n(8)\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe following tables present the changes in the balances of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax by component:\n(9)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of inputs used in measuring fair value defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in non-active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs that are not directly observable, but are corroborated by observable market data.\n•\nLevel 3—Inputs that are unobservable and are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment.\nThe classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is determined based on the least reliable level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determining fair value, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. We also consider the counterparty and our own non-performance risk in our assessment of fair value.\nThe following table presents fair values of our financial and debt instruments categorized by their fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022:\nAssets that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payables, short-term obligations and certain other assets at cost approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.\nF-28\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have $\n55.5\nmillion in investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and asset-backed securities with maturity dates through 2027. The fair values of these securities are considered Level 2 as they are based on inputs from quoted prices in markets that are not active or other observable market data.\nAssets that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have an\n18\n% interest in BFTR, LLC. The investment in common stock is accounted under the equity method because we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee and the securities do not have readily determinable fair values. Our investment is carried at cost less any impairment write-downs. Periodically, our equity method investments are assessed for impairment. We do not reassess the fair value of equity method investments if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investments. No events or changes in circumstances have occurred during the period that require reassessment. There has been\nno\nimpairment of our equity method investment for the periods presented. This investment is included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually on October 1.\nIn addition, we review goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed our annual assessment of goodwill which did not result in an impairment charge. Further, we identified no indicators of impairment to long-lived and other assets and therefore, no impairment was recorded as of and for the period ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value only for disclosure purposes\nThe fair value of our borrowing under our 2021 Credit Agreement would approximate book value as of December 31, 2022, because our interest rates reset approximately every 30 days or less.\nThe carrying amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loans is the par value less the debt discount and debt issuance costs that are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the Term Loans. Interest expense is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nThe fair value of our Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 is determined based on quoted market prices for a similar liability when traded as an asset in an active market, a Level 2 input. See Note 6, “Debt,” for further discussion.\nThe carrying amount of the Convertible Senior Notes is the par value less the debt discount and debt issuance costs that are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. Interest expense is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table presents the fair value and carrying value, net, of the 2021 Credit Agreement and our Convertible Notes due 2026):\nF-29\n(10)\nINCOME TAX\nIncome tax provision (benefit) on income from operations consists of the following:\nReconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax expense rate for operations follows:\nIn 2022, we completed a multi-year research and development tax credit study, which resulted in a $\n31.3\nmillion research tax credit benefit.\nThe tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 are:\nAs of December 31, 2022, the capitalization and amortization requirements of research and experimental expenditures pursuant to the TCJA changes to Internal Revenue Code Section 174 resulted in a deferred tax asset of $\n76.7\nmillion.\nF-30\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n22.9\nmillion, after-tax state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n1.6\nmillion, and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n4.1\nmillion. The federal net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in 2037, if not utilized, and a portion of the state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards begin expiring in 2033, if not utilized.\nThe acquired carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized. We believe it is more likely than not that all other deferred tax assets will be realized. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of reversing taxable temporary differences are revised.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022\n, $\n1.9\nmillion of the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected as a decrease in deferred income taxes and $\n12.7\nmillion are included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, net of federal income tax benefit of state taxes, if recognized, that would affect the effective tax rate is\n$\n13.9\nmillion\nas of December 31, 2022, and\n$\n4.3\nmillion\nand\n$\n1.9\nmillion\nas of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. It is reasonably possible that events will occur during the next 12 months that would cause the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to increase or decrease. However, we do not expect such increases or decreases to be material to the financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax of multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely subject to income tax examinations by these taxing jurisdictions, but we do not have a history of, nor do we expect any material adjustments as a result of these examinations. With few exceptions, major U.S. federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to examination for years before 2018. As of February 22, 2023, no significant adjustments have been proposed by any taxing jurisdiction.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalty amounts were not significant at December 31, 2022.\n(11)\nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe following table details activity in our common stock:\nAs of February 22, 2023, we had authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to\n2.3\nmillion additional shares of our common stock.\nF-31\n(12)\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nShare-Based Compensation Plan\nIn May 2018, stockholders approved the Tyler Technologies, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 2018 Plan”) which amended and restated the existing Tyler Technologies, Inc. 2010 Stock Option Plan (“the 2010 Plan”). Upon stockholder approval of the 2018 Plan, the remaining shares available for grant under the 2010 Plan were added to the shares authorized for grant under the 2018 Plan. Additionally, any awards previously granted under the 2010 Plan that expire unexercised or are forfeited are added to the shares authorized for grant under the 2018 Plan.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we granted stock awards under the 2018 Plan in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units. Stock options generally vest after\nthree\nto\nsix years\nof continuous service from the date of grant and have a contractual term of\n10\nyears. Once options become exercisable, the employee can purchase shares of our common stock at the market price on the date we granted the option. Restricted stock unit grants generally vest ratably over\nthree\nto\nfive years\nof continuous service from the date of grant. Each performance share unit represents the right to receive\none\nshare of our common stock based on our achievement of certain financial performance targets during applicable performance periods. We account for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition pursuant to ASC 718,\nStock Compensation\n.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were\n1.3\nmillion shares available for future grants under the 2018 Plan from the\n22.9\nmillion shares previously approved by the shareholders.\nDetermining Fair Value of Stock Compensation\nValuation and Amortization Method. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. For restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards, we estimate fair value as market value on the date of grant. We amortize the fair value of all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods, which are generally the vesting periods.\nExpected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The expected life represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options’ vesting terms, remaining contractual life and the employees’ expected exercise based on historical patterns.\nExpected Volatility. Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in more than ten years and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of\nzero\nin the Black-Scholes option valuation model.\nExpected Forfeitures. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. We record share-based compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used for options granted:\nF-32\nShare-Based Award Activity\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit and performance stock unit activity during the periods presented (shares in thousands):\nOptions granted, exercised, forfeited and expired are summarized as follows:\nWe had unvested options to purchase approximately\n267,000\nshares with a weighted average grant date exercise price of $\n346.14\nas of December 31, 2022, and unvested options to purchase approximately\n445,000\nshares with a weighted average grant date exercise price of $\n293.84\nas of December 31, 2021.\nOther information pertaining to option activity was as follows during the twelve months ended December 31:\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation expense related to share-based awards which is recorded in the consolidated statements of income:\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $\n175.6\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options and restricted stock units, net of expected forfeitures, which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average amortization period of\n2.7\nyears.\nF-33\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) participants may contribute up to\n15\n% of their annual compensation to purchase common shares of Tyler. The purchase price of the shares is equal to\n85\n% of the closing price of Tyler shares on the last day of each quarterly offering period. As of December 31, 2022, there were\n576,000\nshares available for future issuances under the ESPP from the\n2.0\nmillion shares previously approved by the stockholders.\n(13)\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table details the reconciliation of basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share:\nShare-based awards representing the right to purchase common stock of\n372,000\nshares in 2022,\n117,000\nshares in 2021, and\n132,000\nshares in 2020, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have had an antidilutive effect.\nWe have used the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 on our diluted net income per share. Under the if-converted method, the Notes are assumed to be converted at the beginning of the period and the resulting common shares are included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation for the entire period being presented and interest expense, net of tax, recorded in connection with the Convertible Senior Notes is not added back to the numerator, only in the periods in which such effect is dilutive. The approximately\n1.2\nmillion remaining resulting common shares related to the Notes are not included in the dilutive weighted-average common shares outstanding calculation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as their effect would be antidilutive given none of the conversion features have been triggered. See Note 6, “Debt,”\nfor discussion on the conversion features related to the Convertible Senior Notes.\n(14)\nLEASES\nWe lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation and other equipment. Most of our leases are non-cancelable operating lease agreements with original maturities between\none\nto\n12\nyears. Some of these leases include options to extend for up to\nsix years\n. We have no finance leases and no related party lease agreements as of December 31, 2022. Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities for our operating leases are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. During 2022, we incurred lease restructuring costs, resulting in an additional $\n1.7\nmillion of operating lease costs.\nThe components of operating lease expense were as follows:\nF-34\nSupplemental information related to leases is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2022, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nRental Income from third parties\nWe own office buildings in Bangor, Falmouth and Yarmouth, Maine; Lubbock and Plano, Texas; Troy, Michigan; Latham, New York; and Moraine, Ohio. We lease space in some of these buildings to third-party tenants. The property we lease to others under operating leases consists primarily of specific facilities where one tenant obtains substantially all of the economic benefit from the asset and has the right to direct the use of the asset. These non-cancelable leases expire between 2023 and 2027, and some have options to extend the lease for up to\n10\nyears. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. None of our leases allow the lessee to purchase the leased asset.\nRental income from third-party tenants was $\n1.7\nmillion in 2022, $\n1.2\nmillion in 2021, and $\n1.1\nmillion in 2020. Rental income is included in hardware and other revenue on the consolidated statements of income.\nFuture minimum operating rental income based on contractual agreements is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had no additional significant operating or finance leases that had not yet commenced.\nF-35\n(15)\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nWe provide a defined contribution plan for the majority of our employees meeting minimum service requirements. Eligible employees can contribute up to\n30\n% of their current compensation to the plan subject to certain statutory limitations. We contribute up to a maximum of\n3\n% of an employee’s compensation to the plan. We made contributions to the plan and charged operating results $\n17.5\nmillion in 2022, $\n15.6\nmillion in 2021, and $\n12.7\nmillion in 2020.\n(16)\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nDuring the first quarter 2022, the Company received a notice of termination for convenience for professional services under a contractual arrangement with a state client. Upon receipt of the termination notice, we ceased performing services under the contractual arrangement and sought payment of contractually owed fees of approximately $\n15\nmillion in connection with the termination for convenience. As of December 31, the total exposure in our financial statements included the remaining balance of net billed accounts receivable for licenses and services rendered under the contract of approximately $\n12\nmillion.\nThe client was unresponsive to company outreach for several months. On August 23, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit to enforce our rights and remedies under the applicable contractual arrangement. The client has not filed responsive pleadings and no other significant activity has occurred in the lawsuit. Although we believe our products and services were delivered in accordance with the terms of our contract and that we are entitled to payment in connection with the termination for convenience, at this time the matter remains unresolved. We are unable to estimate the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome with respect to the dispute or estimate the amount of potential loss, if any, related to this matter. We can provide no assurances that we will not incur additional costs as we pursue our rights and remedies under the contract.\nPurchase Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations for third-party technology used in our solutions and for other services we purchase as part of our normal operations. In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining aggregate minimum purchase commitment under these arrangements was approximately $\n264\nmillion through 2028.\nFuture minimum payments related to purchase commitments based on contractual agreements is as follows:\n(17)\nSEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION\nWe provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector.\nWe provide our software systems and related professional services and appraisal services through\nseven\nbusiness units, which focus on the following products:\n•\nfinancial management, education and planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;\n•\nfinancial management, municipal courts, planning, regulatory, and maintenance software solutions;\n•\ncourts and justice and public safety software solutions;\n•\ndata and insights solutions;\n•\nappraisal and tax software solutions, land and vital records management software solutions, and property appraisal services;\n•\ndevelopment platform solutions including case management and business process management; and\n•\ndigital government and payments solutions.\nF-36\nIn accordance with ASC 280-10,\nSegment Reporting\n, we report our results in\ntwo\nreportable segments. The Enterprise Software (\"ES\") reportable segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical “back-office” functions such as: financial management and education; planning, regulatory and maintenance; courts and justice; public safety; data and insights; appraisal and tax software solutions; land and vital records management software solutions; and property appraisal services. The Platform Technologies (\"PT\") reportable segment provides public sector entities with software solutions to perform transaction processing, streamline data processing, and improve operations and workflows such as digital government and payments solutions and development platform solutions.\nWe evaluate performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment operating income. We define segment operating income for our business units as income before non-cash amortization of intangible assets associated with their acquisitions, interest expense, and income taxes. Segment operating income includes intercompany transactions. The majority of intercompany transactions relate to contracts involving more than one unit and are valued based on the contractual arrangement. Corporate segment operating loss primarily consists of compensation costs for the executive management team, certain shared services staff, and share-based compensation expense for the entire company. Corporate segment operating income also includes revenues and expenses related to a company-wide user conference. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the appraisal and tax software solutions, land and vital records management software solutions, and property appraisal service business unit, which was previously reported in the Appraisal & Tax (\"A&T\") reportable segment, was moved to the ES reportable segment. The digital government and payments solutions, which was previously reported in the NIC reportable segment, and development platform solutions moved to the PT reportable segment to reflect changes in the way in which management makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. As a result of the changes in our reportable segments, the former A&T and NIC reportable segments are no longer considered separate segments. Prior periods amounts for the ES and PT reportable segments have been adjusted to reflect the segment change.\nSegment assets primarily consist of net accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets and net property and equipment, and software development costs. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and investments, prepaid insurance, intangibles associated with acquisitions, deferred income taxes and net property and equipment mainly related to unallocated information and technology assets.\nThe ES segment capital expenditures included $\n3.6\nmillion in 2022 and $\n12.8\nmillion in 2021 for the expansion of existing buildings and purchases of buildings. The PT segment had $\n863,000\ncapital expenditures in 2022 and had\nno\ncapital expenditures in 2021 for the expansion of existing buildings.\nF-37\nF-38\n(18)\nDISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\nThe tables below show disaggregation of revenue into categories that reflect how economic factors affect the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows.\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nTiming of revenue recognition by revenue category during the period is as follows:\nF-39\nRecurring Revenues\nThe majority of our revenue is comprised of revenues from subscriptions and maintenance, which we consider to be recurring revenues. Subscriptions revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from our SaaS arrangements and transaction-based fees, which relate to digital government services, e-filing transactions, and payment processing. Total subscriptions revenue derived from transaction-based fees included in total recurring revenues was $\n600.8\nmillion, $\n454.8\nmillion, and $\n91.0\nmillion, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The contract terms for subscription arrangements range from\none\nto\n10\nyears but are typically contracted for initial periods of\nthree\nto\nfive years\n. Virtually all of our on-premises software clients contract with us for maintenance and support, which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenues. That maintenance and support is generally provided under annual, or in some cases, multi-year contracts. We consider all other revenue categories to be non-recurring revenues.\nRecurring revenues and non-recurring revenues recognized during the period are as follows:\n(19)\nDEFERRED REVENUE AND PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nTotal deferred revenue, including long-term, by segment is as follows:\nChanges in total deferred revenue, including long-term, were as follows:\nF-40\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized (“backlog”), which includes deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Backlog as of December 31, 2022 was $\n1.89\nbillion, of which we expect to recognize approximately\n47\n% as revenue over the next\n12\nmonths and the remainder thereafter.\n(20)\nDEFERRED COMMISSIONS\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized commensurate with the recognition of associated revenue over a period of benefit that we have determined to be generally\nthree\nto\nseven years\n. Deferred commissions were $\n43.8\nmillion and $\n38.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense was $\n15.4\nmillion, $\n13.4\nmillion, and $\n11.9\nmillion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. There were\nno\nindicators of impairment in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented. Deferred commissions have been included with prepaid expenses for the current portion and non-current other assets for the long-term portion in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense related to deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n(21)\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThere have been no material events or transactions that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2022.\nF-41"
