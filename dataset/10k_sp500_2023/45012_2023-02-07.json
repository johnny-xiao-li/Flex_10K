Our services and products are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services and products include: price; service delivery; health, safety, and environmental standards and practices; service quality; global talent retention; understanding the geological characteristics of the reservoir; product quality; warranty; and technical proficiency.\nWe conduct business worldwide in more than 70 countries. The business operations of our divisions are organized around four primary geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and Middle East/Asia. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 45%, 40%, and 38%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during these periods. See \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about our geographic operations. Because the markets for our services and products are vast and cross numerous geographic lines, it is not practicable to provide a meaningful estimate of the total number of our competitors. The industries we serve are highly competitive, and we have many substantial competitors. Most of our services and products are marketed through our service and sales organizations.\nThe following charts depict our revenue split between our four primary geographic regions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 3\nOur operations in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, health or similar issues, sanctions, expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange restrictions and highly inflationary currencies, as well as other geopolitical factors. We believe the geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the risk that an interruption of operations in any one country, other than the United States, would be materially adverse to our business, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated financial condition.\nInformation regarding our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, risk concentration, and financial instruments used to minimize risk is included in \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Instrument Market Risk” and in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCustomers\nOur revenue during the past three years was derived from the sale of services and products to the energy industry. No single customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in any period presented.\nRaw materials\nRaw materials essential to our business are normally readily available. However, market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials, such as proppants (primarily sand), chemicals, metals, and gels. We are always striving to ensure the availability of resources and manage raw material costs. Our procurement department uses our relationships and buying power to enhance our access to key materials at competitive prices.\nPatents\nWe own a large number of patents and have pending a substantial number of patent applications covering various products and processes. We are also licensed to utilize technology covered by patents owned by others, and we license others to utilize technology covered by our patents. We do not consider any particular patent to be material to our business operations.\nSeasonality\nWeather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services, but the widespread geographical locations of our operations mitigate those effects. Examples of how weather can impact our business include:\n-    the severity and duration of the winter in North America can have a significant impact on drilling activity and on natural gas storage levels;\n-    the timing and duration of the spring thaw in Canada directly affects activity levels due to road restrictions;\n-    typhoons and hurricanes can disrupt coastal and offshore operations; and\n-    severe weather during the winter normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea.\nAdditionally, customer spending patterns for completion tools typically result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of the year. We recognize revenue on customer software contract sales predominantly in the first and fourth quarters of the year.\nOur workforce\nOur workforce is our top asset in enabling us to accomplish innovative, high-quality work for our customers and to address the world’s energy challenges. To attract and retain talent, we strive to provide a safe and inclusive working environment along with competitive benefits. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 45,000 people worldwide representing 130 nationalities, operated in more than 70 countries, and approximately 21% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Based upon the geographic diversification of our employees, we do not believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions are material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole.\nRecruiting and Turnover\nGiven the size and geographic scope of our workforce, we have a robust world-wide recruiting apparatus, which includes personnel devoted to recruiting and retention, online job postings, and recruiting programs we have established at academic institutions for internships and entry-level roles. In order to increase the number of diverse employees, we have developed relationships with diversity-focused student organizations, provide professional development sessions to students, engage our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to participate in select university events, and participate in outreach efforts through programs supported by our Educational Advisory Board.\nIn 2022, we hired about 10,500 new employees and were able to rehire more than 3,000 former employees despite a tight labor market. We have found that hiring former employees allows us to add needed personnel who are able to apply their prior experience at the Company to quickly re-acclimate and add value to their teams.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 4\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\nWith our large employee base and global breadth, we are one of the world’s most diverse companies. Our Code of Business Conduct describes our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, which is supported by our recruitment and employment practices. It is a priority to continue to increase the diversity of our workforce, both in general and in leadership positions. Furthermore, we strive to increase the percentage of local nationals that we employ in each region of operations to better communicate with local customers and other contractors, share knowledge of the culture and values of the local population, improve local economies, and make our workforce more representative of the populations where we provide our services. In 2022, 92% of our workforce and 85% of management were localized, full-time employees not classified as expatriates or commuters. In 2022, 13% of our workforce and 13% of our managers, which includes employees with job levels of supervisor, coordinator and above, were female.\nLeadership\nThe ongoing identification and development of leadership talent ensures business continuity and strengthens our competitive advantage, both of which are critical for our short and long-term success. In 2022, we saw a 31% increase in female candidates on replacement charts since 2020. One of our most significant investments in developing future leaders is our executive education programs. In 2022, approximately 25% of the participants in these programs were female and 59 different nationalities were represented.\nAs part of our commitment to employee engagement, we solicit feedback from employees on their workplace challenges, and empower them to share their perspectives and ideas to improve the overall employee experience, including performance, development, and work-life balance. Notably, according to a survey we conducted in 2022, 96% of our employees feel the work they do everyday matters.\nBenefits and well-being\nWe provide our employees around the world with benefits that address the diverse needs of our workforce and their families. We evaluate our benefits package to identify opportunities for improvement and to remain competitive. In 2022, we enhanced healthcare benefits and expenditure planning for United States employees with refreshed medical plans, enhancements to surrogacy allowance, legal plans, pharmacy advocacy programs, and a global business travel accident program. In 2022, we continued to expand our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and now all Halliburton employees and their families around the globe have access to EAP and best-in-class mental health support services in their local markets.\nSafety\nSafety is a Halliburton core value. We have many safety programs in place, including our Journey to ZERO initiative, to maintain our strong performance and improve proactive identification and management of safety risks. In 2022, we focused on risk management, refreshed primary scorecard metrics, and continued the evolution of our incident investigation program. As a result of our focus on safety, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our total recordable incident rates were 0.29 and 0.25 (incidents per 200,000 hours worked), non-productive times were 0.27% and 0.30% (percentage of total operating hours), lost-time incident rates were 0.08 and 0.09 (incidents per 200,000 hours worked), and preventable recordable vehicle incident rates were 0.10 and 0.16 (incidents per million miles traveled), respectively.\nGovernment regulation\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related to our operations worldwide. For further information related to environmental matters and regulation, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and \"Item 1(a). Risk Factors.”\nHydraulic fracturing\nHydraulic fracturing is a process that creates fractures extending from the well bore into the rock formation to enable natural gas or oil to move more easily from the rock pores to a production conduit. A significant portion of our Completion and Production segment provides hydraulic fracturing services to customers developing shale natural gas and shale oil. From time to time, questions arise about the scope of our operations in the shale natural gas and shale oil sectors, and the extent to which these operations may affect human health and the environment.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 5\nAt the direction of our customer, we design and generally implement a hydraulic fracturing operation to stimulate the well's production after the well has been drilled, cased, and cemented. Our customer is generally responsible for providing the base fluid (usually water) used in the hydraulic fracturing of a well. We frequently supply the proppant (primarily sand) and at least a portion of the additives used in the overall fracturing fluid mixture. In addition, we mix the additives and proppant with the base fluid and pump the mixture down the wellbore to create the desired fractures in the target formation. The customer is responsible for disposing or recycling for further use any materials that are subsequently produced or pumped out of the well, including flowback fluids and produced water.\nAs part of the process of constructing the well, the customer will take a number of steps designed to protect aquifers. In particular, the casing and cementing of the well are designed to provide 'zonal isolation' so that the fluids pumped down the wellbore and the oil and natural gas and other materials that are subsequently pumped out of the well will not come into contact with shallow aquifers or other shallow formations through which those materials could potentially migrate to freshwater aquifers or the surface.\nThe potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing have been studied by numerous government entities and others. In 2004, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted an extensive study of hydraulic fracturing practices, focusing on coalbed methane wells, and their potential effect on underground sources of drinking water. The EPA’s study concluded that hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells poses little or no threat to underground sources of drinking water. In December 2016, the EPA released a final report, “\nHydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States\n” representing the culmination of a six-year study requested by Congress. While the EPA report noted a potential for some impact to drinking water sources caused by hydraulic fracturing, the agency confirmed the overall incidence of impacts is low. Moreover, a number of the areas of potential impact identified in the report involve activities for which we are not generally responsible, such as potential impacts associated with withdrawals of surface water for use as a base fluid and management of wastewater.\nWe have proactively developed processes to provide our customers with the chemical constituents of our hydraulic fracturing fluids to enable our customers to comply with state laws as well as voluntary standards established by the Chemical Disclosure Registry,\nwww.fracfocus.org\n. We have invested considerable resources in developing hydraulic fracturing technologies, in both the equipment and chemistry portions of our business, which offer our customers a variety of environment-friendly options related to the use of hydraulic fracturing fluid additives and other aspects of our hydraulic fracturing operations. We created a hydraulic fracturing fluid system comprised of materials sourced entirely from the food industry. In addition, we have engineered a process that uses ultraviolet light to control the growth of bacteria in hydraulic fracturing fluids, allowing customers to minimize the use of chemical biocides. We are committed to the continued development of innovative chemical and mechanical technologies that allow for more economical and environment-friendly development of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves, and that reduce noise while complying with Tier 4 lower emission legislation.\nIn evaluating any environmental risks that may be associated with our hydraulic fracturing services, it is helpful to understand the role that we play in the development of shale natural gas and shale oil. Our principal task generally is to manage the process of injecting fracturing fluids into the borehole to stimulate the well. Thus, based on the provisions in our contracts and applicable law, the primary environmental risks we face are potential pre-injection spills or releases of stored fracturing fluids and potential spills or releases of fuel or other fluids associated with pumps, blenders, conveyors, or other above-ground equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing process.\nAlthough possible concerns have been raised about hydraulic fracturing, the circumstances described above have helped to mitigate those concerns. To date, we have not been obligated to compensate any indemnified party for any environmental liability arising directly from hydraulic fracturing, although there can be no assurance that such obligations or liabilities will not arise in the future. For further information on risks related to hydraulic fracturing, see \"Item 1(a). Risk Factors.”\nWorking capital\nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flow generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 6\nWeb site access - www.halliburton.com\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available at\nwww.halliburton.com\nsoon thereafter.

    "text": "Item 1(a). Risk Factors.\nWhen considering an investment in Halliburton Company, all of the risk factors described below and other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report should be carefully considered. Any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIndustry Environment Related\nTrends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nDemand for our services and products is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of exploration, development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects, even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies can cause them to reduce or defer major expenditures. Any prolonged reductions of commodity prices or expectations of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include:\n-    the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n-    the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the expanded alliance collectively known as OPEC+ to set and maintain oil production levels;\n-    the level of oil production in the U.S. and by other non-OPEC+ countries;\n-    oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n-    the cost of, and constraints associated with, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n-    governmental regulations and other actions, including economic sanctions and policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n-    weather conditions, natural disasters, and health or similar issues, such as COVID-19 and other pandemics or epidemics;\n-    worldwide political and military actions, and economic conditions, including potential recessions; and\n-    increased demand for alternative energy and use of electric vehicles and increased emphasis on decarbonization, including government initiatives, such as the variety of tax credits contained in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, to promote the use of renewable energy sources and public sentiment around alternatives to oil and gas.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 10\nOur business is dependent on capital spending by our customers, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur business is directly affected by changes in capital expenditures by our customers, and reductions in their capital spending could reduce demand for our services and products and have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Some of the items that may impact our customer's capital spending include:\n-    oil and natural gas prices, which are impacted by the factors described in the preceding risk factor;\n-    the inability of our customers to access capital on economically advantageous terms, which may be impacted by, among other things, a decrease of investors' interest in hydrocarbon producers because of environmental and sustainability initiatives;\n-    changes in customers' capital allocation, including an increased allocation to the production of renewable energy or other sustainability efforts, leading to less focus on oil and natural gas production growth;\n-    restrictions on our customers' ability to get their produced oil and natural gas to market due to infrastructure limitations;\n-    consolidation of our customers;\n-    customer personnel changes; and\n-    adverse developments in the business or operations of our customers, including write-downs of oil and natural gas reserves and borrowing base reductions under customers' credit facilities.\nLiabilities arising out of our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nEvents can occur at sites where our products and equipment are produced, stored, transported, or installed, or where we conduct our operations or provide our services, or at chemical blending or manufacturing facilities, including well blowouts and equipment or materials failures, which could result in explosions, fires, personal injuries, property damage (including surface and subsurface damage), pollution, and potential legal responsibility. Generally, we rely on liability insurance coverage and on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations of liability with our customers to protect us from potential liability related to such occurrences. However, we do not have these contractual provisions in all contracts, and even where we do, it is possible that the respective customer or insurer could seek to avoid or be financially unable to meet its obligations, or a court may decline to enforce such provisions. Damages that are not indemnified or released could greatly exceed available insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by severe or unseasonable weather where we have operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather, particularly in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, and the North Sea. Many experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions. Repercussions of severe or unseasonable weather conditions may include:\n-    evacuation of personnel and inoperability of equipment resulting in curtailment of services;\n-    weather-related damage to offshore drilling rigs resulting in suspension of operations;\n-    weather-related damage to our facilities and project work sites;\n-    inability to deliver materials to job sites in accordance with contract schedules;\n-    fluctuations in demand for oil and natural gas, including possible decreases during unseasonably warm winters; and\n-    loss of productivity.\nOur failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Courts could find that others infringe our patent or other intellectual property rights or that our products and services may infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect us.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 11\nIf we are not able to design, develop and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, developments associated with climate change concerns and energy mix transition, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced.\nThe market for our services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If we are not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, customer requirements, competitive pressures, developments associated with climate change concerns and energy mix transition, and technology trends, our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and the value of our intellectual property may be reduced. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe sometimes provide integrated project management services in the form of long-term, fixed price contracts that may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost over-runs, operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, supplier and contractor pricing and performance, and potential claims for liquidated damages.\nWe sometimes provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business in the form of long-term, fixed price contracts. Some of these contracts are required by our customers, primarily national oil companies. These services include acting as project managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost over-runs. These customers may provide us with inaccurate information in relation to their reserves, which is a subjective process that involves location and volume estimation, that may result in cost over-runs, delays, and project losses. In addition, our customers often operate in countries with unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest, or other types of community issues. These issues may also result in cost over-runs, delays, and project losses.\nProviding services on an integrated basis may also require us to assume additional risks associated with operating cost inflation, labor availability and productivity, supplier pricing and performance, and potential claims for liquidated damages. We rely on third-party subcontractors and equipment providers to assist us with the completion of these types of contracts. To the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials in a timely manner and on reasonable terms, our ability to complete a project in accordance with stated deadlines or at a profit may be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed-price work, we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts. These delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to compensate our customers for these delays. This may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project.\nConstraints in the supply of, prices for, and availability of transportation of raw materials can have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nRaw materials essential to our operations and manufacturing, such as proppants (primarily sand), chemicals, metals, and gels, are normally readily available. Shortage of raw materials as a result of high levels of demand or loss of suppliers during market challenges can trigger constraints in the supply chain of those raw materials, particularly where we have a relationship with a single supplier for a particular resource. Many of the raw materials essential to our business require the use of rail, storage, and trucking services to transport the materials to our job sites. These services, particularly during times of high demand, may cause delays in the arrival of or otherwise constrain our supply of raw materials. These constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, price increases imposed by our vendors for raw materials and transportation providers used in our business, and the inability to pass these increases through to our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nOur ability to operate and our growth potential could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot attract, employ, and retain technical personnel at a competitive cost.\nMany of the services that we provide and the products that we sell are complex and highly engineered and often must perform or be performed in harsh conditions. We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, employ, and retain technical personnel with the ability to design, utilize, and enhance these services and products. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our cost structure could increase, our margins could decrease, and any growth potential could be impaired.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 12\nLaws and Regulations Related\nOur operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations. For example, our operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits United States companies and their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. Our activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, agents, or joint venture partners that could be in violation of anti-corruption laws, even though some of these parties are not subject to our control. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs for our employees and agents with respect to the FCPA. However, we cannot assure that our policies, procedures, and programs will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. We are also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners, and agents outside of the United States may fail to comply with other applicable laws. Allegations of violations of applicable anti-corruption laws have resulted and may in the future result in internal, independent, or government investigations. Violations of anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nIn addition, the shipment of goods, services, and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the export, re-export, and in-country transfer of certain goods, services, and technology and impose related export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons, and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons, and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. The imposition of such sanctions on Russia in connection with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to our decision to dispose of our Russian operations during the third quarter of 2022.\nThe laws and regulations concerning import activity, export recordkeeping and reporting, export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations can cause delays in shipments and unscheduled operational downtime. Moreover, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory trading obligations could result in government investigations of our activities, as well as criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from governmental contracts, seizure of shipments, and loss of import and export privileges.\nOur activities outside of the United States expose us to various legal, social, economic, and political issues which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nChanges in, compliance with, or our failure to comply with laws in the countries in which we conduct business may negatively impact our ability to provide services in, make sales of equipment to, and transfer personnel or equipment among some of those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nIn the countries in which we conduct business, we are subject to multiple and, at times, inconsistent regulatory regimes, including those that govern our use of radioactive materials, explosives, and chemicals in the course of our operations. Various national and international regulatory regimes govern the shipment of these items. Many countries, but not all, impose special controls upon the export and import of radioactive materials, explosives, and chemicals. Our ability to do business is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these multiple regulatory requirements applicable to these special products. In addition, the various laws governing import and export of both products and technology apply to a wide range of services and products we offer. In turn, this can affect our employment practices of hiring people of different nationalities because these laws may prohibit or limit access to some products or technology by employees of various nationalities. Changes in, compliance with, or our failure to comply with these laws may negatively impact our ability to provide services in, make sales of equipment to, and transfer personnel or equipment among some of the countries in which we operate and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 13\nThe adoption of any future federal, state, or local laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nVarious federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives, as well as actions in other countries, have been or could be undertaken that could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, the United States may seek to adopt federal regulations or enact federal laws that would impose additional regulatory requirements on or even prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some areas. Legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in many U.S. states that require additional disclosure regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that generally include protections for proprietary information. Legislation, regulations, and/or policies have also been adopted at the state level that impose other types of requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations (such as limits on operations in the event of certain levels of seismic activity). Additional legislation and/or regulations have been adopted or are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory requirements (such as prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations. Four states (New York, Maryland, Vermont, and Washington) have banned the use of high volume hydraulic fracturing, Oregon has adopted a five-year moratorium, and Colorado has enacted legislation providing local governments with regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing operations. Local jurisdictions in some states have adopted ordinances that restrict or in certain cases prohibit the use of hydraulic fracturing, although many of these ordinances have been challenged and some have been overturned. In addition, governmental authorities in various foreign countries where we have provided or may provide hydraulic fracturing services have imposed or are considering imposing various restrictions or conditions that may affect hydraulic fracturing operations. The adoption of any future federal, state, local, or foreign laws or regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nLiability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations in the United States and the other countries where we do business. We evaluate and address the environmental impact of our operations by assessing and remediating contaminated properties to avoid future liabilities and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. From time to time, claims have been made against us under environmental laws and regulations. In the United States, environmental laws and regulations typically impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior operators or other third parties. We are periodically notified of potential liabilities at federal and state superfund sites. These potential liabilities may arise from both historical Halliburton operations and the historical operations of companies that we have acquired. Our exposure at these sites may be materially impacted by unforeseen adverse developments both in the final remediation costs and with respect to the final allocation among the various parties involved at the sites. The relevant regulatory agency may bring suit against us for amounts in excess of what we have accrued and what we believe is our proportionate share of remediation costs at any superfund site. We also could be subject to third-party claims, including punitive damages, with respect to environmental matters for which we have been named as a potentially responsible party. Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental laws or related third-party claims could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 14\nFailure on our part to comply with, and the costs of compliance with, applicable health, safety, and environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nIn addition to the numerous environmental laws and regulations that apply to our operations, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to health and safety. Among those laws and regulations are those covering hazardous materials and requiring emission performance standards for facilities. For example, our well service operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous substances. We also store, transport, and use radioactive and explosive materials in certain of our operations. Applicable regulatory requirements include those concerning:\n-    the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste, and other waste materials;\n-    the production, storage, transportation and use of explosive materials;\n-    the importation and use of radioactive materials;\n-    the use of underground storage tanks;\n-    the use of underground injection wells; and\n-    the protection of worker safety both onshore and offshore.\nThese and other requirements generally are becoming increasingly strict. The failure to comply with the requirements, many of which may be applied retroactively, may result in:\n-    administrative, civil, and criminal penalties;\n-    revocation of permits to conduct business; and\n-    corrective action orders, including orders to investigate and/or clean up contamination.\nFailure on our part to comply with applicable health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations or costs arising from regulatory compliance, including compliance with changes in or expansion of applicable regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nExisting or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases, climate change, or alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nChanges in or the adoption or enactment of laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to greenhouse gases, climate change, or alternative energy sources, including changes that may make it more expensive to explore for and produce oil and natural gas, may negatively impact demand for our services and products. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. State, national, and international governments and agencies in areas in which we conduct business continue to evaluate, and in some instances adopt, climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases.\nThe President of the United States has issued Executive Orders seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and to suspend, revise, or rescind prior agency actions that the administration identified as conflicting with its climate policies. These include Executive Orders requiring a review of current U.S. federal lands leasing and permitting practices, as well as a temporary halt of new leasing of U.S. federal lands and offshore waters available for oil and gas exploration. The Executive Orders halting the leasing of U.S. federal lands were challenged in court and, in August 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana issued a permanent injunction against the temporary halt to the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas drilling. As a result of the review of leasing and permitting practices, the U.S. Department of the Interior recommended increasing the royalty rate payable to the U.S. government by operators, as well as bonding requirements and emissions requirements for operators. The Biden Administration resumed selling leases to drill for oil and gas on federal lands in April 2022, but with an 80% reduction in the number of acres offered and an increase in the royalties companies must pay to drill. All of these changes could have a negative effect on exploration and production of oil and natural gas and, consequently, negatively impact the demand for our products and services.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 15\nIn February 2021, the United States formally re-joined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gases emission reduction goals, every five years. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed strict new methane emission regulations for certain oil and gas facilities. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 establishes a charge on methane emissions above certain limits from the same facilities. Though we are closely following developments in this area and changes in the regulatory landscape in the United States, we cannot predict how or when those changes may ultimately impact our business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements related to greenhouse gases or climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and could have a negative impact on our business. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide. The efforts we have taken, and may undertake in the future, to respond to these evolving or new regulations and to environmental initiatives of customers, investors, and others may increase our costs. These and other environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation, tax audits, or exposure to additional tax liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous jurisdictions where we operate and our subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. In addition, our tax returns are subject to examination by the U.S. and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of the examinations. An increase in tax rates, particularly in the U.S., changes in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our tax returns could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to political and economic instability and risk of government actions that\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries in which we operate. Our operations are subject to various risks unique to each country that could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. With respect to any particular country, these risks may include:\n-    political and economic instability, including:\n•\ncivil unrest, acts of terrorism, war, and other armed conflict;\n•\ninflation; and\n•\ncurrency fluctuations, devaluations, and conversion restrictions; and\n-    governmental actions that may:\n•\nresult in expropriation and nationalization of our assets in that country;\n•\nresult in confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies;\n•\nlimit or disrupt markets or our customers and our operations, restrict payments, or limit the movement of funds;\n•\nimpose sanctions on our ability to conduct business with certain customers or persons;\n•\nresult in the deprivation of contract rights; and\n•\nresult in the inability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.\nFor example, due to the unsettled political conditions in many oil-producing countries, our operations, revenue, and profits are subject to the adverse consequences of war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes, currency controls, and governmental actions. These, and other risks described above, could result in the loss of our personnel or assets, cause us to evacuate our personnel from certain countries, cause us to increase spending on security worldwide, cause us to cease operating in certain countries, disrupt financial and commercial markets, including the supply of and pricing for oil and natural gas, and generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographic areas in which we operate. Areas where we operate that have significant risk include, but are not limited to: the Middle East, North Africa, Angola, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Mozambique, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, and Ukraine. In addition, any possible reprisals as a consequence of military or other action, such as acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 16\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur operations are subject to cyberattacks that\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe are increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business. We use these technologies for internal and operational purposes, including data storage, processing, and transmissions, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers. Examples of these digital technologies include analytics, automation, and cloud services. Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. We routinely monitor our systems for cyber threats and have processes in place to detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, we have experienced occasional cyberattacks and attempted breaches over the past year, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and malware infections. We responded to and mitigated the impact of these incidents. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on our business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack. No known leakage of material financial, technical, or customer data occurred as a result of cyberattacks against us and none of the incidents mentioned above had a material adverse effect on our business, operations, reputation, or consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition.\nIf our systems, or our business associates' systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things: loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; interruption of our business operations; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our business associates, customers, employees, and other third parties, and may result in claims against us. In addition, laws and regulations governing cybersecurity, data privacy, and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential or protected information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties and legal liability. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations and we may be unable to meet our capital return framework goal of returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which could decrease expected returns on an investment in our stock.\nOur capital return framework includes a goal of returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sales of property, plant, and equipment) to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Dividends and share repurchases are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors at its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including our financial results, cash requirements, and future prospects, as well as such other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We can provide no assurance that we will pay dividends or make share repurchases in accordance with our capital return framework goal or at all. Any elimination of, or downward revision in, our dividend payout or share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nMeeting our capital return framework goal requires us to generate consistent free cash flow and have available capital in the years ahead in an amount sufficient to enable us to continue investing in organic and inorganic growth as well as to return a significant portion of the cash generated to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Also, our cash flow fluctuates over the course of the year, so, although our goal is to return at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, that is an average over a year and the dividends paid, the number of shares repurchased, and the amount of free cash flow returned in any quarter during the year will vary and may be more or less than 50%. We may not meet this goal if we use our available cash to satisfy other priorities, if we have insufficient funds available to pay dividends and to repurchase shares, or if our Board of Directors determines to change or discontinue dividend payments or share repurchases.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 17\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risks and limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries or to repatriate assets from some countries.\nA sizable portion of our consolidated revenue and consolidated operating expenses is in foreign currencies. As a result, we are subject to significant risks, including:\n-    foreign currency exchange risks resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the implementation of exchange controls; and\n-    limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries.\nAs an example, we conduct business in countries that have restricted or limited trading markets for their local currencies and restrict or limit cash repatriation. We may accumulate cash in those geographies, but we may be limited in our ability to convert our profits into United States dollars or to repatriate the profits from those countries.\nIf we lose one or more of our significant customers or if our customers delay paying or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe have a number of significant customers. While no single customer represented more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any period presented, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated results of operations.\nIn most cases, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. We may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets, particularly in weak economic or commodity price environments. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nOur acquisitions, dispositions and investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments, or joint venture interests. These transactions are intended to (but may not) result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the offering of new products or services, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk. Acquisition transactions may use cash on hand or be financed by additional borrowings or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions may also affect our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nThese transactions also involve risks, and we cannot ensure that:\n-    any acquisitions we attempt will be completed on the terms announced, or at all;\n-    any acquisitions would result in an increase in income or provide an adequate return of capital or other anticipated benefits;\n-    any acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n-    the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, including under the FCPA, or that we will appropriately quantify the exposure from known risks;\n-    any disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash flow;\n-    use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses; or\n-    any dispositions, investments, or acquisitions, including integration efforts, would not divert management resources.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 18\nActions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.\nWe conduct some operations through joint ventures in which unaffiliated third parties may control the operations of the joint venture or we may share control. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference, or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any violation of law, nonperformance, or default by, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.\nThe loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 19"

    "text": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" contained herein.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nMarket conditions\nSince early 2020, world-wide oil and gas supply and demand imbalances and related volatility of oil and natural gas prices (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) have resulted in dramatic fluctuations in oil and gas markets. The volatility continued in 2022 as markets were impacted by inflationary pressures, changes to OPEC+ production levels, supply chain shortages, demand uncertainty, and geopolitical conflicts including Russia's invasion of and continued war with Ukraine. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price averaged approximately $88 per barrel during the fourth quarter of 2022 and $96 per barrel for the full year of 2022. The U.S. land average rig count continues to be below pre-pandemic levels, but showed\ni\nmprovement in each quarter of 2022\n. The Brent crude oil price averaged $89 per barrel during the\nfourth\nquarter of 2022 and $101 per barrel for the full year of 2022. The international average rig count showed improvement in the second half of 2022\n.\nGlobally, we are being impacted by supply chain shortages and increased lead times as the post-pandemic recovery stressed both the supply of raw materials and transportation logistics. We monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale in global procurement, technology modifications, and efficient sourcing practices. Also, while we have been impacted by inflationary cost increases, primarily related to frac sand, chemicals, cement, and logistics costs, we generally try to pass much of those increases on to our customers and we believe we have effective solutions that work to minimize the operational impact.\nAs a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, governments in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other countries enacted new sanctions against Russia and Russian interests. In order to comply with these sanctions, we ceased pursuing future business in Russia and began to wind down our remaining operations in Russia in March of 2022. During the second quarter of 2022, we made the decision to sell our Russian operations and completed the sale in the third quarter of 2022. We wrote down the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $344 million during the second quarter of 2022. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFinancial results\nThe following graph illustrates our revenue and operating margins for each operating segment over the past three years.\nDuring 2022, we generated total company revenue of $20.3 billion, a 33% increase from the $15.3 billion of revenue generated in 2021, with our Completion and Production (C&P) segment revenue increasing by 38% and our Drilling and Evaluation (D&E) segment revenue increasing by 27%. We reported total company operating income of approximately $2.7 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $1.8 billion in 2021. These increases were driven primarily by increased demand for our products and services in North America land tied to a substantial improvement in the North America average rig count during 2022. Both of our segments were negatively impacted by our exit from Russia in the third quarter of 2022.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 23\nOur North America revenue increased 51% in 2022 compared to 2021, resulting from higher activity and pricing in North America land primarily associated with increased stimulation and well construction services. North America average rig count increased 47% for 2022 as compared to the average rig count for 2021.\nInternationally, revenue improved 20% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher activity for drilling and completions related services in Latin America and the Eastern Hemisphere, which were partly offset by our exit from Russia and lower activity in the North Sea. The international average rig count increased 13% for 2022 as compared to the average rig count for 2021.\nOur operating performance and liquidity are described in more detail in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Business Environment and Results of Operations.”\nSustainability and Energy Mix Transition\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we announced our target to achieve 40% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. During 2022, we continued to execute on priorities we set to help us progress toward our 2035 emissions reduction target. As our customers have begun to invest more in reducing emissions and developing projects focused on sustainable energy, we have developed or are developing solutions intended to reduce our own carbon footprint while advancing our customers’ decarbonization efforts. As the energy mix transition unfolds, we will continue to seek to apply our expertise and products and services across different developing parts of the energy mix transition. We have also applied our experience and resources in sectors adjacent to our traditional oilfield services sectors, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and geothermal. Finally, we will continue to focus on accelerating the success of clean tech start-ups via Halliburton Labs. As of December 31, 2022, Halliburton Labs had 21 participating companies and alumni. Halliburton Labs allows us to participate in the energy mix transition at relatively low risk by investing our expertise, resources, and team without a significant outlay of capital.\nOur sustainability efforts have been recognized as we were named to the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), which recognizes the top 10% most sustainable companies per industry. The DJSI uses ESG criteria to measure and rank the performance of best-in-class companies selected for its list. When compared to our peers, we ranked in the 98th percentile and received high marks in the Human Capital Development, Risk & Crisis Management, and Business Ethics categories.\nAdditionally, we published our 2021 Annual and Sustainability Report (ASR) in March of 2022, which details our strategy and progress on sustainability issues, as well as our efforts on increased environmental reporting transparency, including conducting a climate scenario analysis. Information on our website, including the ASR report, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 24\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents, compared to $3.0 billion of cash and equivalents at December 31, 2021.\nSignificant sources and uses of cash in 2022\nSources of cash:\n•\nCash flows from operating activities were $2.2 billion. This included a negative\nimpact from the primary components of our working capital (receivables, inventories, and accounts payable) of a net\n$941 million,\nprimarily associated with increased receivables and inventory.\nUses of cash:\n•\nDebt repayments were $1.2 billion. In February of 2022, we paid $641 million to redeem $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.8% senior notes due November 2025. The payment also included the make-whole premium and accrued interest. In September of 2022, we paid $603 million to redeem $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.5% senior notes due August 2023 at par. The payment also included accrued interest.\n•\nCapital expenditures were $1.0 billion.\n•\nWe paid $435 million of dividends to our shareholders.\n•\nWe repurchased 6.8 million shares for $250 million.\nFuture sources and uses of cash\nWe manufacture most of our own equipment, which provides us with some flexibility to increase or decrease our capital expenditures based on market conditions. Capital spending for 2023 is currently expected to be within our target of approximately 5-6% of revenue. We believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic areas. However, we will continue to maintain capital discipline and monitor the rapidly changing market dynamics, and we may adjust our capital spend accordingly.\nIn 2023, we expect to pay approximately $897 million for contractual purchase obligations (with another $292 million due through 2025), $416 million of interest on debt, and approximately $333 million under our leasing arrangements. Payments for interest on our debt arrangements are expected to remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. See Note 6 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on expected future payments under our leasing arrangements and debt maturities.\nWe are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, in part because we are unable to predict the timing of potential tax settlements with applicable taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2022, we had $311 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding penalties and interest, of which we estimate $259 million may require us to make a cash payment. We estimate that approximately $232 million of the cash payment will not be settled within the next 12 months.\nWhile we maintain our focus on liquidity and debt reduction, we are also focused on increasing cash returns to our shareholders. Our Board approved a capital return framework with a goal of returning at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nIn January of 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.16 per common share for the first quarter of 2023, or approximately $145 million. During 2022, our quarterly dividend rate was $0.12 per common share, or approximately $109 million per quarter.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. Approximately $4.9 billion remained authorized for repurchases as of December 31, 2022 and may be used for open market and other share purchases.\nWe do not intend to incur additional debt in 2023, as we believe our cash on hand and earnings from operations are sufficient to cover our obligations for the year.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 25\nOther factors affecting liquidity\nFinancial position in current market.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of available committed bank credit under a revolving credit facility executed on April 27, 2022 with an expiration date of April 27, 2027. We believe we have a manageable debt maturity profile, with approximately $500 million coming due beginning in 2025 through 2027. Furthermore, we have no financial covenants or material adverse change provisions in our bank agreements, and our debt maturities extend over a long period of time. We believe our cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations, and our available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to address\nthe challenges and opportunities of the current market and\nour global cash needs, including capital expenditures, working capital investments, dividends, if any, debt repayment, and contingent liabilities.\nGuarantee agreements.\nIn the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $2.1 billion letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization, however, none of these triggering events have occurred. As of December 31, 2022, we had no material off-balance sheet liabilities and were not required to make any material cash distributions to our unconsolidated subsidiaries.\nCredit ratings.\nOur credit ratings with Standard & Poor’s (S&P) remain BBB+ for our long-term debt and A-2 for our short-term debt, with a stable outlook. Our credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service (Moody's) remain Baa1 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our short-term debt, with a stable outlook.\nCustomer receivables\n. In line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers’ cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets, as well as unsettled political conditions.\nReceivables from our primary customer in Mexico accounted for approximately 9% of our total receivables as of December 31, 2022. While we have experienced payment delays in Mexico, these amounts are not in dispute and we have not historically had, and we do not expect to have, any material write-offs due to collectability of receivables from this customer.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 26\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe operate in more than 70 countries throughout the world to provide a comprehensive range of services and products to the energy industry. Our revenue is generated from the sale of services and products to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide. The industry we serve is highly competitive with many substantial competitors in each segment of our business. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 45%, 40%, and 38%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.\nActivity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development, and production programs by our customers. Also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas consumption.\nSome of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices and our customers' expectations about future prices, global oil supply and demand, completions intensity, the world economy, the availability of capital, government regulation, and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling and completions activity.\nAdditionally, during 2023, we generally expect that many of our customers in North America will continue their strategy of operating within their cash flows and generating returns rather than prioritizing production growth.\nLower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets and lower rig count, while the opposite is usually true for higher oil and natural gas prices. Our financial performance is therefore significantly affected by oil and natural gas prices and worldwide rig activity, which are summarized in the tables below.\nThe table below shows the average prices for WTI crude oil, United Kingdom Brent crude oil, and Henry Hub natural gas.\nThe historical average rig counts based on the weekly Baker Hughes rig count data were as follows:\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 27\nBusiness outlook\nAccording to the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) January 2023 \"Short Term Energy Outlook,\" the EIA expects Brent crude oil spot prices to average $83 per barrel for the full year of 2023, a decrease of approximately 18% over the full year of 2022 average price per barrel. The EIA anticipates a further decline in prices to $78 per barrel for the full year of 2024 as they believe global oil inventories will build, applying downward pressure on crude oil prices. The EIA expects the WTI crude oil spot prices to average $77 per barrel for the full year of 2023, a decrease of approximately 19% over the full year of 2022 average price per barrel.\nThe EIA's report projects Henry Hub natural gas prices to average $4.90 per MMBtu for the full year of 2023, an approximate 24% decrease over 2022 full year averages.\nThe EIA reported crude oil production in the United States averaged 11.9 million barrels per day in 2022 and expects production to average 12.4 million barrels per day in 2023, an approximate 4% increase. In addition, the EIA expects crude oil production in the United States to rise to 12.8 million barrels per day in 2024.\nThe International Energy Agency's January 2023 \"Oil Market Report\" forecasts 2023 global oil demand to reach 101.7 million barrels per day, an increase of approximately 2% from 2022.\nWe continue to expect that oil and gas demand will grow over the next several years, despite the actions taken by central banks in an attempt to control inflation by increasing interest rates and the resulting concern about a potential economic slowdown. We believe the demand will be driven by economic expansion, energy security concerns, relaxed COVID restrictions in China, and population growth. In addition, we think supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to investor return requirements, publicly stated environmental, social, and governance commitments, and regulatory pressure, all of which resulted in low inventory levels (compared to historical levels) and production below expectations. We believe many years of increased investment in existing and new sources of production is the only solution to increase supply and that production will be needed from conventional and unconventional, deep-water and shallow-water, and short and long-cycle projects.\nInternationally, we expect activity to grow at least 14-16% during 2023 with most new activity coming from the Middle East and Latin America, both in onshore and offshore markets. In North America, we expect strong activity and anticipate customer spending to increase by at least 15% during 2023 as compared to 2022.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 28\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2022 COMPARED TO 2021\nOperating Segments\nCompletion and Production\nCompletion and Production revenue was $11.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $3.2 billion, or 38%, compared to 2021. Operating income was $2.0 billion in 2022, a 65% increase from $1.2 billion in 2021. These results were primarily driven by higher utilization and pricing for pressure pumping services in the Western Hemisphere, additional completion tool sales in the Western Hemisphere and Saudi Arabia, increased artificial lift activity in North America land, and increased well intervention services in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased activity in Russia due to our exit from the country, lower completion tool sales and cementing activity in Norway, and decreased stimulation activity in Oman.\nDrilling and Evaluation\nDrilling and Evaluation revenue was $8.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 27%, from 2021. Operating income was $1.3 billion in 2022, an increase of $491 million, or 61%, compared to 2021. These results were primarily related to increased drilling-related services in the Western Hemisphere, Middle East/Asia, West Africa, Egypt, and Eastern Mediterranean, along with higher wireline activity and testing services globally. Project management activity increased in Latin America, India, and Saudi Arabia. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced activity in Russia due to our exit from the country and decreased drilling-related services in Norway.\nGeographic Regions\nNorth America\nNorth America revenue was $9.6 billion in 2022, a 51% increase compared to 2021, resulting from higher activity and pricing across the region, primarily associated with pressure pumping activity, drilling-related services, and completion tool sales. Higher artificial lift activity in North America land, along with additional wireline activity and well intervention services in North America land and the Gulf of Mexico, also contributed to this increase.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 29\nLatin America\nLatin America revenue was $3.2 billion in 2022, a 35% increase compared to 2021, resulting primarily from improvements across multiple product service lines in Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, increased project management activity and well construction services in Ecuador, higher completion tool sales in Brazil and the Caribbean, additional pressure pumping activity in Brazil, and improved project management activity in Suriname. Partly offsetting these increases were lower well intervention and drilling-related services in Brazil.\nEurope/Africa/CIS\nEurope/Africa/CIS revenue was $2.7 billion in 2022, a 1% decrease compared to 2021. The decrease was mostly driven by lower activity in Russia due to our exit from the country and reduced activity in Norway. This decline was partially offset by increases in multiple product service lines in Egypt, Angola, and Eastern Mediterranean, combined with higher drilling-related services in West Africa and increased well intervention services across the region.\nMiddle East/Asia\nMiddle East/Asia revenue was $4.8 billion in 2022, a 25% increase compared to 2021. The increase was primarily from improvements across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, India, and United Arab Emirates, higher well construction services in Oman, Indonesia, and Iraq, and additional completion tool sales and cementing activity in Qatar. Partially offsetting these increases were lower stimulation and well intervention services in Oman.\nOther Operating Items\nImpairments and other charges.\nDuring 2022, we recognized $366 million of charges, primarily related to a $344 million write down of all our net assets in Russia as a result of our decision to sell our Russia operations due to the sanctions enacted against Russia arising from the conflict in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2022, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $22 million to write down all of our assets in Ukraine, including $16 million in receivables, due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. During 2021, we recognized $12 million of net charges. These charges included $36 million of depreciation catch-up expense on our Pipeline and Process Services business assets previously classified as held for sale, $15 million of severance costs, and $35 million of other items, partially offset by a $74 million gain related to the closing of a structured transaction for our North America real estate assets. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these charges.\nNonoperating Items\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a $42 million loss on the early redemption of $600 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.8% senior notes due November 2025, which included premiums and unamortized expenses. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a total income tax provision of $515 million on pre-tax income of $2.1 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.4%. The effective tax rate for 2022 was primarily impacted by our geographic mix of earnings, tax adjustments related to the reassessment of prior year tax accruals, and changes of valuation allowance on some of our deferred tax assets. During 2021, we recorded a total income tax benefit of $216 million on pre-tax income of $1.3 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of -17.2%. We recorded a tax benefit of approximately $500 million during 2021, primarily due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. This release was based on improved market conditions and reflects our expectation to utilize these deferred tax assets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for significant drivers of these tax (provisions) benefits.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 30\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2021 COMPARED TO 2020\nInformation related to the comparison of our operating results between the years 2021 and 2020 is included in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our\nfiled with the SEC and is incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 31\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. Our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimates and how they can impact our financial statements. A critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. We identified our most critical accounting estimates to be:\n-    forecasting our income tax (provision) benefit, including our future ability to utilize foreign tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards), and providing for uncertain tax positions;\n-    legal and investigation matters;\n-    valuations of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill; and\n-    allowance for credit losses.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nIncome tax accounting\nWe recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes:\n-    a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year;\n-    a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;\n-    the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered; and\n-    the value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.\nWe determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. That determination includes the following procedures:\n-    identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences;\n-    measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate;\n-    measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate;\n-    measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward; and\n-    reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nOur methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment and the use of assumptions and estimates. Additionally, we use forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies. Given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results that could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to continuing operations.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 32\nWe have operations in more than 70 countries. Consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. The income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. Our tax filings are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. The final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved, the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. The final determination of tax audits or changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year and have an adverse effect on our financial statements.\nTax filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates and related entities are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. These examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. Predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. Factors such as the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate, and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome. We review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest, and penalties, as needed based on this outcome. We provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The standards also provide guidance for derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.\nLegal and investigation matters\nAs discussed in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to various legal and investigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2022, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for the resolution of some of our legal and investigation matters, which is not material to our consolidated financial statements. For other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any amounts. Attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against us and review all pending investigations. Generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. Our estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. The accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. We attempt to resolve these matters through settlements, mediation, and arbitration proceedings when possible. If the actual settlement costs, final judgments, or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, there may be a material adverse effect on our future financial results. We have in the past recorded significant adjustments to our initial estimates of these types of contingencies.\nValue of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill\nWe carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other intangibles. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, and any impairment charge that we record reduces our operating income. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We conduct impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the third quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. We conduct impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nWhen conducting an impairment test on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. This requires some judgment. We then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group’s carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis is based on estimates such as management’s short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. An impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairments and other charges.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 33\nWe perform our goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, the Completion and Production division and the Drilling and Evaluation division, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures, and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.\nThe impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for our services, and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. If market conditions deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies related to long-lived assets.\nAllowance for credit losses\nWe evaluate our global accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing our portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the receivables involve retainages. We also consider the economic environment of our customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for an allowance. Based on our review of these factors, we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. This process involves judgment and estimation, and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. Accordingly, our results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.\nAt December 31, 2022, our allowance for credit losses totaled $\n731\nmillion, or 14.7% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. At December 31, 2021, our allowance for credit losses totaled $\n754\nmillion, or 17.8% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. The allowance for credit losses in both years is primarily comprised of accounts receivable from our primary customer in Venezuela. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in our estimate of the collectability of our notes and accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022 would have resulted in a $50 million adjustment to 2022 total operating costs and expenses. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options, and interest rate swaps. The objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. The counterparties to our forward contracts, options, and interest rate swaps are global commercial and investment banks.\nWe use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of potential adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. With respect to foreign exchange sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our forward foreign exchange contracts and options, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of all our foreign currency positions relative to the United States dollar as of December 31, 2022 would result in a $90 million, pre-tax loss for our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than United States dollars. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding and our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates.\nThere are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates and interest rates change instantaneously in an equally adverse fashion. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the various scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts.\nFor further information regarding foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 34\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements related to our operations worldwide.

Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based upon criteria set forth in the\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. The effectiveness of Halliburton’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.\nHALLIBURTON COMPANY\nby\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 38\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nHalliburton Company:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Halliburton Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 7, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets         and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized, which is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $3.7 billion and a related valuation allowance of $0.8 billion.\nWe identified the evaluation of the realizability of domestic deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of the realizability of domestic deferred tax assets, specifically related to foreign tax credits, required subjective auditor judgment to assess the forecasts of future taxable income over the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Changes in assumptions regarding forecasted taxable income, specifically revenue growth rates, could have an impact on the Company’s evaluation of the realizability of the domestic deferred tax assets.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 39\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the development of forecasts of future taxable income. We evaluated the assumptions used in the development of forecasts of future taxable income, specifically revenue growth rates, by comparing to historical actuals while considering current and anticipated future commodity prices or market events. We also evaluated the Company’s history of realizing domestic deferred tax assets by evaluating the expiration of foreign tax credits.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 7, 2023\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 40\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nHalliburton Company:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Halliburton Company and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n-\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n-\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 7, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 7, 2023\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 41\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 42\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 43\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 44\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 45\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 46\nHALLIBURTON COMPANY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1.\nDescription of Company and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Company\nHalliburton Company is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. Its predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1924. We help our customers maximize asset value throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production throughout the life of the asset. We serve major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world and operate under\ntwo\ndivisions, which form the basis for the\ntwo\noperating segments we report, the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and Evaluation segment.\nUse of estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles, requiring us to make estimates and assumptions that affect:\n-    the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and\n-    the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nWe believe the most significant estimates and assumptions are associated with the forecasting of our income tax (provision) benefit and the valuation of deferred taxes, legal reserves, long-lived asset valuations, and allowance for credit losses. Ultimate results could differ from our estimates.\nBasis of presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all of our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in companies in which we do not have a controlling interest, but over which we do exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, unless we elect the fair value option. If we do not have significant influence and the investment has no readily determinable fair value, we elect the measurement alternative. In addition, certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to the current period presentation.\nRevenue recognition\nOur services and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with our customers that include fixed or determinable prices but do not include right of return provisions or other significant post-delivery obligations. The vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. We recognize revenue based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. We also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with, and the financial condition of our customers. Rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man-hour, or similar basis.\nSee Note 4 for further information on revenue recognition.\nResearch and development\nWe maintain an active research and development program. The program improves products, processes, and engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs of our customers. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and were $\n345\nmillion in 2022, $\n321\nmillion in 2021, and $\n309\nmillion in 2020.\nCash equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of\nthree months\nor less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost represents invoice or production cost for new items and original cost. Production cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Our inventory is recorded on the weighted average cost method. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, estimated product demand, and technological developments.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 47\nAllowance for credit losses\nWe establish an allowance for credit losses through a review of several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and current financial condition of our customers. Losses are charged against the allowance when the customer accounts are determined to be uncollectible.\nProperty, plant, and equipment\nOther than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to impairment, property, plant, and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Accelerated depreciation methods are often used for tax purposes, when permitted. Upon sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. Planned major maintenance costs are generally expensed as incurred. Expenditures for additions, modifications, and conversions are capitalized when they increase the value or extend the useful life of the asset.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nWe record as goodwill the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition.\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill are detailed below by reportable segment.\nThe reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, during the third quarter, and more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. As a result of our goodwill impairment assessments performed in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net book value and, therefore,\nno\ngoodwill impairments were deemed necessary.\nWe amortize other identifiable intangible assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis over the period which the asset is expected to contribute to our future cash flows, ranging from\none year\nto\ntwenty-eight years\n. The components of these other intangible assets generally consist of patents, license agreements, non-compete agreements, trademarks, and customer lists and contracts.\nEvaluating impairment of long-lived assets\nWhen events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. For assets classified as held for use, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. We then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. If the asset group's undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis and recognize any resulting impairment. When an asset is classified as held for sale, the asset’s book value is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. In addition, depreciation and amortization is ceased while it is classified as held for sale.\nSee Note 2\nfor further information on impairments and other charges.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 48\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative instruments\nAt times, we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value and reflected through the results of operations. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against:\n-    the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings; or\n-    recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nThe ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value is recognized in earnings. Recognized gains or losses on derivatives entered into to manage foreign currency exchange risk are included in “Other, net” on the consolidated statements of operations. Gains or losses on interest rate derivatives are included in “Interest expense, net.”\nForeign currency translation\nForeign entities whose functional currency is the United States dollar translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary items are translated at historical rates. Revenue and expense transactions are translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for those expenses associated with nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical rates. Gains or losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities due to changes in exchange rates are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in “Other, net” in the year of occurrence.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee’s service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. Additionally, compensation cost is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest, therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures.\nSee Note 13 for additional information related to stock-based compensation.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 49\nNote 2.\nImpairments and Other Charges\nThe following table presents various pre-tax charges we recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 which are reflected within \"Impairments and other charges\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resulting sanctions imposed on Russia, we made the decision to sell our Russian operations and completed the sale in the third quarter of 2022. We wrote down the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $\n344\nmillion. Of this pre-tax charge, approximately $\n131\nmillion was attributable to our Completion and Production segment, approximately $\n178\nmillion was attributable to our Drilling and Evaluation segment, and $\n35\nmillion was selling costs and was attributable to Corporate and other. We no longer conduct operations in Russia. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n22\nmillion primarily related to the write down of all our assets in Ukraine. Included in this charge is a $\n16\nmillion allowance for credit loss as we do not expect to collect our receivables in Ukraine. Long-lived asset impairments include impairments of property, plant, and equipment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n12\nmillion of impairments and other charges was recorded due to the decision to discontinue the proposed sale of our Pipeline and Process Services business and as a result we recorded a $\n36\nmillion charge for accumulated unrecognized depreciation and amortization expense during the period the associated assets were classified as held for sale. Additionally, we finalized a structured transaction relating to most of our owned United States real estate. As a result of the transaction, we derecognized $\n358\nmillion of assets previously held for sale included in Other current assets and recognized an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary of $\n349\nmillion included in Other Assets, which resulted in a gain of $\n74\nmillion, due to specific assets with a carrying amount less than the fair value.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the $\n2.6\nbillion of long-lived asset impairments consisted of the following: $\n1.0\nbillion attributable to hydraulic fracturing equipment, the majority of which was located in North America; $\n297\nmillion related to drilling-related services equipment; $\n191\nmillion related to right-of-use assets, primarily operating leases; $\n131\nmillion related to intangible assets; and $\n394\nmillion associated with other fixed asset impairments. Also included in \"Long-lived asset impairments\" was $\n616\nmillion for a fair value adjustment on real estate properties held for sale, primarily related to a contemplated structured transaction for our North America real estate assets due to specific assets with a fair value less than the carrying amount. Inventory costs and write-downs for 2020 in the table above primarily represent disposal of excess inventory, including drilling fluids and other chemicals, and write-downs in which some of our inventory cost exceeded its market value.\nNote 3.\nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\nWe operate under\ntwo\ndivisions, which form the basis for the\ntwo\noperating segments we report: the Completion and Production segment and the Drilling and Evaluation segment. Our equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within cost of services and cost of sales on our statements of operations, which is part of operating income of the applicable segment.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 50\nOperations by business segment\nThe following tables present financial information on our business segments.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 51\nOperations by geographic region\nThe following tables present information by geographic area. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, based on the location of services provided and products sold,\n45\n%,\n40\n%, and\n38\n%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the United States. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue or property, plant, and equipment during the periods presented. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,\n54\n% and\n50\n%, respectively, of our property, plant, and equipment was located in the United States.\nNote 4.\nRevenue\nRevenue is recognized based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. Most of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. In recognizing revenue for our services and products, we determine the transaction price of purchase orders or contracts with our customers, which may consist of fixed and variable consideration. We also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with, and the financial condition of our customers. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within\n20\nto\n60\ndays. Other judgments involved in recognizing revenue include an assessment of progress towards completion of performance obligations for certain long-term contracts, which involve estimating total costs to determine our progress towards contract completion, and calculating the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nWe disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into types of services or products, consistent with our\ntwo\nreportable segments, in addition to geographical area. Based on the location of services provided and products sold,\n45\n%,\n40\n%, and\n38\n% of our consolidated revenue was from the United States for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 52\nThe following table presents information on our disaggregated revenue.\nContract balances\nWe perform our obligations under contracts with our customers by transferring services and products in exchange for consideration. The timing of our performance often differs from the timing of our customer’s payment, which results in the recognition of receivables and deferred revenue. Deferred revenue represents advance consideration received from customers for contracts where revenue is recognized on future performance of service. Deferred revenue, as well as revenue recognized during the period relating to amounts included as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period, was not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nTransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent firm contracts for which work has not been performed and future revenue recognition is expected. We have elected the practical expedient permitting the exclusion of disclosing remaining performance obligations for contracts that have an original expected duration of\none year\nor less. We have some long-term contracts related to software and integrated project management services such as lump sum turnkey contracts. For software contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time throughout the license period when the software is considered to be a right to access our intellectual property. For lump sum turnkey projects, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, which requires us to exercise judgment. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for these long-term contracts is not material.\nNote 5.\nReceivables\nAs of December 31, 2022,\n38\n% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the United States and\n11\n% were from customers in Mexico. As of December 31, 2021,\n34\n% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the United States and\n11\n% were from customers in Mexico. Receivables from our primary customer in Mexico accounted for approximately\n9\n% and\n10\n% of our total receivables as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. While we have experienced payment delays in Mexico, these amounts are not in dispute and we have not historically had, and we do not expect, any material write-offs due to collectability from this customer.\nNo\nother country or single customer accounted for more than\n10\n% of our receivables at those dates.\nAlthough the market environment has been improving, we continue to have risk of delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues. We routinely monitor the financial stability of our customers and employ an extensive process to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables. This process, which involves judgment and estimates, includes analysis of our customers’ historical time to pay, financial condition and various financial metrics, debt structure, credit ratings, and production profile, as well as political and economic factors in countries of operations and other customer-specific factors.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 53\nThe table below presents a rollforward of our allowance for credit losses for 2020, 2021 and 2022.\nNote 6.\nLeases\nFor operating leases, lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and accretion of the lease liability, while finance leases include both an operating expense and an interest expense component. For all leases with a term of 12 months or less, we recognize lease expense for these short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe are a lessee for numerous operating leases, primarily related to real estate, transportation, and equipment. The vast majority of our operating leases have remaining lease terms of\n10\nyears or less, some of which include options to extend the leases, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. We generally do not include renewal or termination options in our assessment of the leases unless extension or termination for certain assets is deemed to be reasonably certain. The accounting for some of our leases may require judgment, which includes determining whether a contract contains a lease, determining the incremental borrowing rates to utilize in our net present value calculation of lease payments for lease agreements which do not provide an implicit rate, and assessing the likelihood of renewal or termination options. We also have some lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. For certain equipment leases, such as offshore vessels and drilling rigs, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately.\nThe following tables illustrate the financial impact of our leases as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, along with other supplemental information about our existing leases:\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 54\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed a structured transaction relating to most of our owned United States real estate, which resulted in an increase of our operating right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $\n276\nmillion. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the structured transaction.\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of our operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2022:\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 55\nNote 7.\nInventories\nInventories consisted of the following:\nAll amounts in the table above are reported net of obsolescence reserves of $\n104\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and $\n114\nmillion at December 31, 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $\n70\nmillion of impairment charges related to inventory. These charges were primarily attributable to our exit from Russia. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairments and other charges.\nNote 8.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment were composed of the following:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $\n100\nmillion of impairment charges on property, plant, and equipment primarily related to our exit from Russia. During the year ended December 31, 2021,\nno\nimpairment charges were recorded on property, plant, and equipment. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairments and other charges.\nClasses of assets are depreciated over the following useful lives:\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 56\nNote 9. Debt\nOur total debt, including short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, consisted of the following:\nSenior debt\nWe may redeem all of our senior notes from time to time or all of the notes of each series at any time at the applicable redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOur\n6.75\n% notes due February 2027 and\n7.6\n% senior debentures due August 2096\nmay not be redeemed prior to maturity\n.\n3.8% senior notes due November 2025 redemption\nIn February of 2022, we redeemed $\n600\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n3.8\n% senior notes due in November 2025. The early redemption of the notes resulted in a loss of $\n42\nmillion, consisting of premiums and unamortized expenses. The loss is included in \"Loss on early extinguishment of debt\" in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. We used cash on hand to fund the aggregate redemption price of the notes in the amount of $\n641\nmillion, which included the principal amount, the make-whole premium, and accrued interest. The remaining $\n400\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n3.8\n% senior notes remains outstanding.\n3.5% senior notes due August 2023 redemption\nIn September of 2022, we redeemed the entire $\n600\nmillion outstanding principal amount of our\n3.5\n% senior notes due  August 2023 at par. We used cash on hand to fund the redemption amount of $\n603\nmillion, which included the principal amount and accrued interest.\nRevolving credit facilities\nOn April 27, 2022, we entered into a $\n3.5\nbillion five-year revolving credit facility which replaced our $\n3.5\nbillion revolving credit facility established in March of 2019. The revolving credit facility is for general working capital purposes and expires on April 27, 2027. The full amount of the revolving credit facility was available as of December 31, 2022.\nDebt maturities\nOur long-term debt matures as follows:\nno\namounts in 2023 or 2024, $\n400\nmillion in 2025,\nno\namounts in 2026, $\n104\nmillion in 2027, and the remainder thereafter.\nNote 10.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal or governmental proceedings, claims or investigations, including personal injury, property damage, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, tax, and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business, the resolution of which, in the opinion of management, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position. There is inherent risk in any legal or governmental proceeding, claim or investigation, and no assurance can be given as to the outcome of these proceedings.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 57\nGuarantee arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we have in place agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $\n2.1\nbillion of letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization. None of these off balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 11.\nIncome Taxes\nThe components of the (provision) benefit for income taxes on continuing operations were:\nThe United States and foreign components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows:\nReconciliations between the actual (provision) benefit for income taxes on continuing operations and that computed by applying the United States statutory rate to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a total income tax provision of $\n515\nmillion on pre-tax income of $\n2.1\nbillion, resulting in an effective tax rate of\n24.4\n%. The effective tax rate for 2022 was primarily impacted by our geographic mix of earnings, tax adjustments related to the reassessment of prior year tax accruals, and changes of valuation allowance on some of our deferred tax assets.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 58\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a total income tax benefit of $\n216\nmillion on pre-tax income of $\n1.3\nbillion, resulting in an effective tax rate of -\n17.2\n%. The effective tax rate for 2021 was primarily impacted by our geographic mix of earnings, tax adjustments related to the reassessment of prior year tax accruals, and valuation allowances on some of our deferred tax assets. The decrease in our valuation allowances results from increased future years’ forecasted taxable income before the expiration of foreign tax credits and net operating losses as a direct result of improved energy market conditions that led to the release of approximately $\n519\nmillion valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\nThe primary components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we decreased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $\n64\nmillion attributable to a $\n221\nmillion decrease associated with foreign deferred tax assets and a $\n157\nmillion increase primarily associated with foreign tax credits.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $\n730\nmillion of domestic and foreign tax-effected net operating loss carryforwards, with approximately $\n36\nmillion estimated to be utilized against our unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, we had approximately $\n1\nbillion of foreign tax credits carryforwards, the majority of which will begin expiring in tax years after 2024. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.\nOur deferred tax assets from net operating losses, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits will expire as follows:\nWe have not provided incremental United States income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign subsidiaries' earnings after December 31, 2017. We generally do not provide for taxes related to undistributed earnings because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 59\nThe following table presents a rollforward of our unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties.\nOur tax returns are subject to review by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we file tax returns. In most cases we are no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for years before 2010. The only significant operating jurisdiction that has tax filings under review or subject to examination by the tax authorities is the United States. The United States federal income tax filings for tax years 2016 through 2021 are currently under review or remain open for review by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\nNote 12.\nShareholders’ Equity\nShares of common stock\nThe following table summarizes total shares of common stock outstanding:\nOur Board of Directors has authorized a program to repurchase a specified dollar amount of our common stock from time to time. The program does not require a specific number of shares to be purchased and the program may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program may be terminated or suspended at any time. We purchased\n6.8\nmillion shares of our common stock under the program during the year ended December 31, 2022. There were\nno\nrepurchases made under the program during the year ended December 31, 2021. Approximately $\n4.9\nbillion remained authorized for repurchases as of December 31, 2022. From the inception of this program in February 2006 through December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately\n231\nmillion shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $\n9.3\nbillion.\nPaid-in Capital in Excess of Par Value\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we issued common stock from treasury shares under our employee stock purchase plan awards and for restricted stock grants. As a result, additional paid in capital would have resulted in a balance below zero. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we reduced retained earnings by $\n275\nmillion and $\n277\nmillion, respectively. Additional issuances from treasury shares could similarly impact additional paid in capital and retained earnings.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 60\nPreferred stock\nOur preferred stock consists of\nfive million\ntotal authorized shares at December 31, 2022, of which\nnone\nare issued.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following:\nNote 13.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation costs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n.\nOur Stock and Incentive Plan, as amended (Stock Plan), provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of stock-based awards:\n-    stock options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options;\n-    restricted stock awards;\n-    restricted stock unit awards;\n-    stock appreciation rights; and\n-    stock value equivalent awards.\nThere are currently no stock appreciation rights, stock value equivalent awards, or incentive stock options outstanding. Under the terms of the Stock Plan, approximately\n264\nmillion shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to employees and non-employee directors. At December 31, 2022, approximately\n20\nmillion shares were available for future grants under the Stock Plan. The stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an award under the Stock Plan may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.\nIn addition to the provisions of the Stock Plan, we also have stock-based compensation provisions under the Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).\nEach of the active stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed below.\nStock options\nThere were no stock options granted during 2022 and there are no plans to grant stock options in 2023. All stock options under the Stock Plan were granted at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date. Employee stock options generally vest ratably over a period of\nthree years\nand expire\n10\nyears from the grant date. Compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the entire vesting period.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 61\nThe following table represents our stock options activity during 2022.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $\n43\nmillion in 2022, $\n315,000\nin 2021, and $\n7,000\nin 2020. As of December 31, 2022, there was\nno\nunrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock options.\nCash received from issuance of common stock was $\n229\nmillion of which $\n148\nmillion related to proceeds from exercises of stock options during 2022. Cash received from issuance of common stock was $\n79\nmillion during 2021 and $\n87\nmillion during 2020, of which $\n4\nmillion related to proceeds from exercises of stock options in 2021. All other cash received from issuance of common stock during 2022, 2021 and 2020 relates to cash proceeds from the issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan.\nThe fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility of options granted was a blended rate based upon implied volatility calculated on actively traded options on our common stock and upon the historical volatility of our common stock. The expected term of options granted was based upon historical observation of actual time elapsed between date of grant and exercise of options for all employees.\nThe assumptions and resulting fair values of options granted were as follows:\nRestricted stock\nRestricted shares issued under the Stock Plan are restricted as to sale or disposition. These restrictions generally lapse periodically over a period of\nfive years\n. Restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other conditions in accordance with our established policies. Upon termination of employment, shares on which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to us, resulting in restricted stock forfeitures. The fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is amortized and charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.\nIn 2022, we also granted performance based restricted stock units, with the actual number of shares earned to be determined at the end of a three year performance period based on our achievement of certain predefined targets.\nThese targets are based upon our average return on capital employed as compared to certain competitors and a modifier based upon stock performance compared to the Oilfield Services Index (OSX). A Monte Carlo simulation that uses a probabilistic approach was performed by an actuary to measure grant date fair value. The fair value of these performance based restricted stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the three year performance cycle.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 62\nThe following table represents our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted, vested, and forfeited during 2022.\n.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of shares granted was $\n31.40\nduring 2022, $\n20.94\nduring 2021, and $\n16.53\nduring 2020. The total fair value of shares vested was $\n248\nmillion during 2022, $\n117\nmillion during 2021, and $\n79\nmillion during 2020. As of December 31, 2022, there was $\n351\nmillion of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\nthree years\n.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the ESPP, eligible employees may have up to\n10\n% of their earnings withheld, subject to some limitations, to be used to purchase shares of our common stock. The ESPP contains\nfour\nthree-month offering periods commencing on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year. The price at which common stock may be purchased under the ESPP in 2020, 2021, and 2022 is equal to\n90\n% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date or last trading day of each offering period. Under the ESPP,\n104\nmillion shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance, of which\n73\nmillion shares have been sold through the ESPP since the inception of the plan through December 31, 2022 and\n31\nmillion shares are available for future issuance. The stock to be offered may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.\nThe fair value of ESPP shares was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility was a one-year historical volatility of our common stock.\nThe assumptions and resulting fair values were as follows:\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 63\nNote 14.\nIncome per Share\nBasic income or loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share includes additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Antidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted income or loss per share as their impact was antidilutive.\nA reconciliation of the number of shares used for the basic and diluted income per share computations is as follows:\nNote 15.\nFinancial Instruments and Risk Management\nThe carrying amount of cash and equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nThe carrying amount and fair value of our total debt, including short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, is as follows:\nThe total fair value of our debt decreased during 2022 as a result of the early redemption of senior notes and higher debt yields. The carrying value of our debt decreased as a result of the early redemption of senior notes. See Note 9 for further information.\nOur debt categorized within level 1 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities with transactions occurring on the last\ntwo days\nof period-end. Our debt categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using significant observable inputs for similar liabilities where estimated values are determined from observable data points on our other bonds and on other similarly rated corporate debt or from observable data points of transactions occurring prior to\ntwo days\nfrom period-end and adjusting for changes in market conditions. Differences between the periods presented in our level 1 and level 2 classification of our long-term debt relate to the timing of when third party market transactions on our debt are executed. We have\nno\ndebt categorized within level 3 on the fair value hierarchy.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps. The objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. The fair value of our forward contracts, options, and interest rate swaps was not material as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. The counterparties to our derivatives are primarily global commercial and investment banks.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 64\nForeign currency exchange risk\nWe have operations in many international locations and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, our functional currency, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Techniques in managing foreign currency exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign currency borrowing and investing, and the use of currency exchange instruments. We attempt to selectively manage significant exposures to potential foreign currency exchange losses based on current market conditions, future operating activities, and the associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of loss. The purpose of our foreign currency risk management activities is to minimize the risk that our cash flows from the purchase and sale of products and services in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\nWe use forward contracts and options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the currencies of certain countries in which we do business internationally. These instruments are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes, generally have an expiration date of\none year\nor less, and are not exchange traded. While these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being managed. The use of some of these instruments may limit our ability to benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nDerivatives are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies due primarily to the lack of available markets, cost considerations, or immaterial exposures (non-hedged currencies). We attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure in non-hedged currencies and recognize that pricing for the services and products offered in these countries should account for the cost of exchange rate devaluations.\nThe notional amounts of open foreign exchange derivatives were $\n650\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and $\n637\nmillion at December 31, 2021. The notional amounts of these instruments do not generally represent amounts exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of our exposure or of the cash requirements related to these contracts. The fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is included in both “Other current assets” and in \"Other current liabilities\" in our consolidated balance sheets and was immaterial. The fair value of these instruments is categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach with certain inputs, such as notional amounts hedged, exchange rates, and other terms of the contracts that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our debt and investment portfolios. We had fixed rate long-term debt totaling $\n7.9\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and $\n9.1\nbillion at December 31, 2021. We maintain an interest rate management strategy that is intended to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates.\nCredit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash equivalents and net trade receivables. It is our practice to place our cash equivalents in high quality investments with various institutions. Our net trade receivables are from a broad and diverse group of customers and are generally not collateralized. As of December 31, 2022,\n38\n% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the United States and\n11\n% were from customers in Mexico. As of December 31, 2021,\n34\n% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the United States and\n11\n% were from customers in Mexico. We maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial condition of our customers. See Note 5 for further information.\nWe do not have any significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty to our derivative contracts. We select counterparties to those contracts based on our belief that each counterparty’s profitability, balance sheet, and capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is unlikely to be materially adversely affected by foreseeable events.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 65\nNote 16.\nRetirement Plans\nOur company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number of our employees. These plans include defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans, and other postretirement plans:\n-    our defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return for services rendered. These plans provide an individual account for each participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the participant’s account are to be determined rather than the amount of pension benefits the participant is to receive. Contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of pre-tax income, after-tax income, or discretionary amounts determined on an annual basis. Our expense for the defined contribution plans totaled $\n160\nmillion in 2022, $\n136\nmillion in 2021, and $\n100\nmillion in 2020. The increase in expense from 2021 to 2022 was due to headcount increase for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n-    our defined benefit plans, which include both overfunded and underfunded pension plans, define an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of age, years of service and/or compensation. The underfunded obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our United States defined benefit plans were not material for the periods presented; and\n-    our postretirement plans other than pensions are offered to specific eligible employees. The accumulated benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for these plans were not material for the periods presented.\nFunded status\nFor our international pension plans, at December 31, 2022, the projected benefit obligation was $\n669\nmillion and the fair value of plan assets was $\n665\nmillion, which resulted in an underfunded obligation of $\n4\nmillion. At December 31, 2021, the projected benefit obligation was $\n1.1\nbillion and the fair value of plan assets was $\n1.2\nbillion, which resulted in an overfunded obligation of $\n80\nmillion. The accumulated benefit obligation for our international plans was $\n601\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and $\n1.0\nbillion at December 31, 2021. The decrease in projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation from 2021 to 2022 was due to assumptions change, mainly an increase in discount rate.\nThe following table presents additional information about our international pension plans.\nFair value measurements of plan assets\nThe fair value of our plan assets categorized within level 1 on the fair value hierarchy is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of our plan assets categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy is based on significant observable inputs for similar assets. The fair value of our plan assets categorized within level 3 on the fair value hierarchy is based on significant unobservable inputs.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 66\nThe following table sets forth the fair values of assets held by our international pension plans by level within the fair value hierarchy.\nRisk management practices for these plans include diversification by issuer, industry, and geography, as well as the use of multiple asset classes and investment managers within each asset class. Our investment strategy for our United Kingdom pension plan, which constituted\n74\n% of our international pension plans’ projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2022 and is no longer accruing service benefits, aims to achieve full funding of the benefit obligation, with the plan's assets increasingly composed of investments whose cash flows match the projected liabilities of the plan.\nNet periodic benefit cost\nNet periodic benefit cost for our international pension plans was $\n14\nmillion in 2022, $\n25\nmillion in 2021, and $\n30\nmillion in 2020.\nActuarial assumptions\nCertain weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations of our international pension plans at December 31 were as follows:\nCertain weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost of our international pension plans for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 67\nAssumed long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates for estimating benefit obligations, and rates of compensation increases vary by plan according to local economic conditions. Where possible, discount rates were determined based on the prevailing market rates of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were determined based upon an evaluation of our plan assets and historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions.\nOther information\nContributions.\nFunding requirements for each plan are determined based on the local laws of the country where such plan resides. In certain countries the funding requirements are mandatory, while in other countries they are discretionary. We currently expect to contribute $\n18\nmillion to our international pension plans in 2023.\nBenefit payments.\nExpected benefit payments over the next\n10\nyears for our international pension plans are as follows: $\n43\nmillion in 2023, $\n41\nmillion in 2024, $\n44\nmillion in 2025, $\n46\nmillion in 2026, $\n49\nmillion in 2027, and an aggregate $\n275\nmillion in years 2028 through 2032.\nNote 17. New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2022-04, \"Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\", which is intended to enhance the transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. Supplier finance programs may also be referred to as reverse factoring, payables finance, or structured payables arrangements. The amendments require a buyer that uses supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program’s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period, and associated rollforward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. We expect to adopt the new disclosures, other than the rollforward disclosure, as required at the beginning of fiscal 2023. The rollforward disclosures will be adopted as required at the beginning of 2024. The adoption of this guidance will result in additional disclosures relating to our supplier financing programs and related obligations.\nHAL 2022 FORM 10-K | 68"
