    "text": "Overview\nRepublic is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue. We operate across the United States and Canada through 353 collection operations, 233 transfer stations, 71 recycling centers, 206 active landfills, 3 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 20 treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF), 6 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells. We are engaged in 73 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 128 closed landfills.\nWe believe the total addressable North American environmental services market in which we operate generates approximately $107 billion of annual revenue, which includes the $78 billion United States and Canada recycling and solid waste industry and $29 billion of the broader environmental solutions industry. Within our recycling and solid waste business, we prioritize investments in market verticals with above average growth rates and higher return profiles. Environmental solutions remains fragmented which provides consolidation opportunities to drive scale. We believe we will be able to further expand our addressable market into other segments of the environmental services industry over time by leveraging our differentiated capabilities, including (1) customer zeal, (2) digital and (3) sustainability.\nWe operate throughout North America, but the physical collection and recycling or disposal of material is very much a local business and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each of the markets we serve. By combining local operating management with standardized business practices, we drive greater overall operating efficiency across the Company while maintaining day-to-day operating decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.\nOur purpose-driven vision is to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world. We believe that our products and services are valuable to our customers and essential for long-term sustainability.\nWe further believe our focus and commitment to sustainability allows us to attract and retain the best talent, win more customers, increase customer loyalty and, ultimately, drive higher revenue and profits.\nFoundational Elements\nOur strategy is designed to generate profitable growth by sustainably managing our customers’ needs, and it is underpinned by three foundational elements – (1) our market position, (2) our operating model and (3) our people and talent agenda.\nMarket Position\nOur goal is to develop the best vertically integrated market position to enable us to build density and improve returns. We strive to have leading market position in each of the markets we serve, or have a clear path toward how we will achieve a leading market position over time. In situations where we cannot establish a leading market position, or where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets.\nWe have a robust market planning process to identify opportunities to grow internally through capital investments and infrastructure development and externally through acquisitions and public-private partnerships. Additionally, our market planning process allows us to analyze market conditions and proactively adjust to trends as they emerge, including the effects of legislation, demographic shifts and changes in the market and the competitive landscape.\nInternal Growth\n•\nVolume Growth\n-\nWe believe volumes are driven by population growth, household formation and new business formation. Volume growth through increases in our customer base and service offerings is the most capital efficient method to grow our business. We seek to obtain long-term contracts for collecting recyclable, solid waste and industrial waste material under residential collection contracts with municipalities, exclusive franchise agreements, small-container and large-container contracts and environmental solutions service contracts. We also look to enter into long-term disposal and recycling contracts with municipalities and other third parties. By obtaining such long-term agreements, we can grow our contracted revenue base at a rate consistent with the underlying economic growth in these markets. In addition, by securing long-term agreements, we are better able to help ensure we earn an appropriate return on the capital deployed.\n2\n•\nPrice Increases\n-\nWe seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs, improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in vehicles, equipment, landfills, transfer stations, recycling centers and other post-collection infrastructure.\n•\nExpansion of Recycling Capabilities\n-\nBased on the most recent United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, approximately 32% of municipal solid waste is recycled and/or composted. We expect that percentage to increase over the long-term as communities enhance and expand their recycling programs for their residents. As a key player in the circular economy, we are strategically focused on expanding recycling volume through innovative material handling processes and programs to help our customers achieve their goals related to sustainability and environmentally sound waste practices while also generating an appropriate return. In 2022, we announced the development of our first Polymer Center, a vertical integration that will advance circularity for plastics and help us manage the plastics stream from curbside collection to delivery of recycled content for consumer packaging. The Polymer Center will enable us to produce food-grade drop-in substitutes for virgin plastics, while allowing us to expand recycling of plastics across North America. We will continue to look for opportunities to expand or enhance our recycling capabilities in markets where customers are demanding these services, demonstrating a willingness to pay and where we can earn an appropriate return on our investment.\n•\nInfrastructure Development - We seek to identify opportunities to further our position as a vertically integrated service provider in markets where we are not fully integrated. Our goal is to create market-specific, vertically integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations, transfer stations, landfills and recycling centers. Where appropriate, we seek to obtain permits to build transfer stations, recycling centers and landfills that would vertically integrate our waste services or expand the service areas for our existing disposal sites. Additionally, we seek opportunities to expand and permit new airspace at our existing landfills in order to replace airspace consumed. Development projects, while generally less capital intensive than acquisitions, typically require extensive permitting efforts that can take years to complete with no assurance of success. We undertake development projects when we believe there is a reasonable probability of success and where reasonably priced acquisition opportunities are not available. Through landfill and fleet innovation, recycling and circularity of key materials and renewable energy production, we are committed to environmentally responsible operations that increase our efficiency as well as our ability to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.\nExternal Growth\n•\nAcquisitions and Public-Private Partnerships\n-\nOur acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and solid waste companies and environmental solutions businesses that complement our existing business platform. We believe our ability to successfully complete these acquisitions is enhanced by the challenges facing many privately-held companies, including increasing competition in the environmental services industry, increasing capital requirements due to changes in regulatory requirements and technology and the limited number of exit strategies for privately-held companies. We also evaluate stand-alone opportunities to acquire businesses and/or facilities that are being divested by other publicly-owned companies.\nWe continue to invest in value-enhancing acquisitions in existing markets. Given our free cash flow, availability under our credit facilities and our ability to access the public capital markets, we have the financial flexibility to make additional acquisitions that will complement our existing business platform, including larger acquisitions if the right opportunities present themselves. For instance, during the second quarter of 2022, we acquired US Ecology, Inc. (US Ecology), a leading provider of environmental solutions, offering treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous and specialty waste.\nWe also focus on growth through public-private partnerships, which include the recycling and waste operations and facilities of municipal and other local governments. We believe over time we have an opportunity to acquire operations and facilities from municipalities and other local governments as they seek to raise capital and/or reduce risk.\nWe realize synergies from consolidating businesses into our existing operations, whether through acquisitions or public-private partnerships, which allows us to reduce capital expenditures and expenses associated with truck routing, personnel, fleet maintenance, inventories and back-office administration.\nOperating Model\nOur operating model allows us to deliver a consistent, high-quality service to all our customers through the Republic Way:\nOne Way. Everywhere. Every Day\n. This approach of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls and tracking allows us to leverage our scale and deliver durable operational excellence. The Republic Way is the key to harnessing the best of what we do as operators and translating that across all facets of our business. Key elements of our operating model are our\n3\norganizational structure, safety, fleet automation, compressed natural gas vehicles, fleet electrification and standardized maintenance.\nOrganizational Structure\nA key enabler of the Republic Way operating model is our organizational structure that fosters a high performance culture by maintaining 360-degree accountability and full profit and loss responsibility with local management, supported by a functional structure to provide subject matter expertise. This structure allows us to take advantage of our scale by coordinating functionally across all of our markets, while empowering local management to respond to unique market dynamics.\nThrough this operating model, we have rolled out several productivity and cost control initiatives designed to deliver the best service possible to our customers in an efficient and environmentally sound way.\nOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through three field groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States and the eastern seaboard of the United States. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating in geographic areas located across the United States and Canada. These groups each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal.\nSafety\nRepublic is dedicated to the safety of our employees, customers and the communities we serve. We have a dedicated team of safety professionals at our corporate headquarters and in our field operations, led by our Vice President of Safety who reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. Due to the nature of our industry, we make safety a top priority and we recognize and reward employees for outstanding safety records. Over the past 10 years, our safety performance (based on OSHA recordable rates) has been 35% better than the industry average. Our\nThink, Choose, Live\nslogan encapsulates our everyday safety messaging to our employees to:\nThink\nabout what you are doing,\nChoose\nthe safe answer and\nLive\nto go home to your family. With the phrase printed on numerous items, including hard hats and the equipment our employees use, there are constant reminders for employees to go home in the same condition in which they came to work. Our goal is to ensure every one of our employees returns home safely each night.\nThrough our Safety Amplified program, we are providing more tools and driving greater awareness to help our teams better execute our safety standards. Regular training, multifaceted programs and strategic partnerships are key components to this program. It is simple by design and comprised of actions and activities that ensure safety is embedded in all we do. The program includes six initiatives to help us achieve our goal to have zero employee fatalities and reduce our OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate.\n•\nFocus Together: This effort is the very core of our safety program and is designed to help frontline employees eliminate the six most common types of serious incidents.\n•\nLead Together: We provide best-in-class communication channels and advanced training techniques for all frontline supervisors and managers to help them guide their teams.\n•\nPartner Together: Staying safe requires involvement by employees at all levels. We’ve increased leadership visits with frontline employees and supervisors to support each divisions’ safety goals.\n•\nCelebrate Together: We take pride in recognizing employees who demonstrate a relentless commitment to safety. Employees with the best driving records are eligible for the industry’s most prestigious award, the National Waste & Recycling Association’s Driver of the Year. Republic drivers have won 72% of the Driver of the Year awards issued for the large truck category since 2009. In addition, our best drivers are recognized and rewarded with competing in our National Road-EO competition.\n•\nAnalyze Together: We analyze real-time data to make short- and long-term decisions and identify opportunities for improvement. Examples include analysis of roadway awareness training, data mapping and other employee protection and preparedness insights.\n•\nInnovate Together: We employ the latest technologies in our fleet, including automation, rear cameras, in-cab backup alarms and event recording systems, and we take a data-driven approach to support our employees. We’re also working with equipment manufacturers to incorporate safety elements such as seat belt alarms, blind spot awareness, lane departure alarms and other potentially lifesaving equipment in our fleet.\n4\nWe believe our Safety Amplified program will provide additional benefits for our Company and stakeholders including:\n•\nfurther strengthening relationships within the communities we service;\n•\nenhancing customer trust;\n•\nstreamlining operational processes and increasing productivity;\n•\ndelivering a reputational advantage, including positioning our Company as an employer-of-choice;\n•\nbuilding and sustaining a safety culture in all areas of our business; and\n•\ncontributing to employee engagement.\nFor more information regarding our safety performance, refer to our Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) report, which can be found at republicservices.com/sustainability. The information contained on our website shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other filing we make under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).\nFleet Automation\nApproximately 76% of our residential routes have been converted to automated single-driver trucks. By converting our residential routes to automated service, we reduce labor costs, improve driver productivity, decrease emissions and create a safer work environment for our employees. Additionally, communities using automated vehicles generally have higher participation rates in recycling programs, thereby complementing our initiative to expand our recycling capabilities.\nCompressed Natural Gas (CNG) Vehicles\nApproximately 20% of our recycling and solid waste collection fleet operates on CNG and approximately 17% of our replacement recycling and solid waste vehicle purchases during 2022 were CNG vehicles. We believe using CNG vehicles provides us with a competitive advantage in communities with strict clean emission initiatives that focus on protecting the environment. Although upfront capital costs are higher, using CNG vehicles reduces our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 45 CNG fueling stations.\nFleet Electrification\nWe believe we are taking a leadership position in electric technology innovation for our recycling and solid waste collection fleet. This is a critical step toward reducing our environmental impact through lower fleet emissions. We believe it will also improve our total cost of ownership while providing a competitive advantage in certain communities. We are partnering with multiple manufacturers to pilot electric-powered recycling and solid waste trucks. As electric vehicle technology continues to develop, we expect to further deploy electrification to our fleet.\nStandardized Maintenance\nBased on an industry trade publication, we operate the fifth largest vocational fleet in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, our average fleet age in years, by line of business, was as follows:\nOneFleet, our standardized vehicle maintenance program, enables us to use best practices for fleet management, truck care and maintenance. Through standardization of core functions, we believe we can minimize variability in our maintenance processes, resulting in higher vehicle quality and a lower environmental footprint while extending the average service life of our fleet. Additionally, our focus on preventative maintenance is improving the reliability of our fleet and enabling us to provide superior service to our customers, differentiating us from our competition.\nPeople and Talent Agenda\nBeing human-centered is at the core of our robust people and talent agenda. We strive to maintain an environment that attracts and retains the best talent. Our approximately 40,000 full-time employees are a critical component in successfully executing our strategy and running our operations. We work hard to remain a company where the best people, with exceptional talents and diverse backgrounds, can thrive and foster a culture of caring where people feel respected, supported and encouraged to bring their best selves to work every day.\n5\nWe are dedicated to driving our people and talent agenda, which includes (1) representing the diversity of the communities we serve and sustaining a safe and inclusive culture, (2) maintaining a highly engaged workforce, (3) developing our talent through learning and development experiences and (4) offering rewards that attract and retain the best workforce. We review key progress metrics such as representation, engagement and turnover and regularly report on these metrics to our Board of Directors. This level of reporting holds all of our leaders accountable for the continued growth and development of our people.\nInclusion and Diversity\nWe believe the composite strength of our employees’ ideas, built on their unique experiences and backgrounds, is essential to our ability to meet and anticipate our customers’ needs.\nWe are proud of the diversity of our front-line workforce, as it closely represents the demographics of the communities we serve. We are relentless in our focus to improve representation of diverse groups across all levels of the Company. Our commitment to inclusion and diversity starts at the top of our organization, as outlined in our Mission of Supporting an Inclusive Culture (MOSAIC), established in 2013 and supported by the MOSAIC Council. The MOSAIC Council consists of leaders from across the Company who serve as ambassadors and thought partners for inclusion and diversity. This enables us to continue to develop new strategies and activities that are tied to the needs of our employees, customers and business with the goal of creating an even more inclusive work environment and diverse workforce.\nWe support inclusion and connectivity for our diverse populations through our Business Resource Groups (BRG) and focus on the involvement of our field locations in all of our BRGs, including Women of Republic, VALOR (Veterans, Advocacy, Learning, Outreach and Recruiting), UNIDOS and the Black Employee Network (BEN). In January 2023, we also launched a new LGBTQ+ BRG.\nIn 2022, we continued our focus on providing programs and virtual events to advance awareness, education and connectivity across our workforce. Our well-attended “Let’s Talk” series aimed at furthering our employees' understanding and empathy related to the topic of inclusion and diversity. In conjunction with this series, we have held multiple \"Let's Connect\" sessions, providing an opportunity for employees across an array of intersectionalities to share their unique experiences and perspectives directly with our CEO. We will continue to offer opportunities to help our employees conduct courageous and authentic conversations with one another. We are committed to maintaining a work environment where people of all backgrounds feel valued and safe to share their perspectives.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe believe an engaged workforce is a key element of our success as engaged employees deliver better customer service and are more productive. We measure employee engagement through a third-party survey, assessing employee sentiment on a variety of topics such as pride for the Company, job satisfaction and intention to stay. Our data reinforces that business units with a highly engaged workforce experience less turnover. We also found that employees whose leaders are highly inclusive are more likely to speak up and share their perspective. Regularly hearing from our employees allows us to understand how to support and strengthen an exceptional employee experience. Our goal is to achieve and maintain employee engagement scores at or above 88 by 2030. Our employee engagement score was 85 in 2022, which is above national benchmarks by five points. Approximately 97% of our employees participated in the engagement survey process in April and October 2022, which represented an all-time high participation rate and is more than 20% higher than the national benchmark. Employee engagement is a core part of our business strategy, which is why we compensate our General Managers, in part, on their employee engagement scores. This reinforces our commitment for leaders to listen and take action on employee feedback and helps to ensure that our leaders are held accountable and rewarded for their efforts to drive a more engaged workforce.\nTalent Development\nWe are committed to providing our employees with opportunities to develop throughout their careers. Our programs, including new hire onboarding and new leader assimilation, reinforce our Company values, expectations and business approach. We relaunched our successful Leadership Fundamentals program in 2022, targeting field leaders. With a goal of reaching all leaders through this program, approximately 650 leaders completed this training in 2022, with approximately 2,150 more slated in 2023. Targeted development experiences support the growth of people in key roles, including Driver Training, Technician Training, Supervisor Training, Sales Acceleration and General Manager Onboarding, among others. We believe these programs provide the fundamental skills necessary to be successful across roles. Additionally, to meet the specific needs of the business, we opened a comprehensive Technical Training Institute in April 2021 where we train and develop our technicians. We have had 98 participants in the course so far.\nOur leadership programs are a critical part of growing our people. We remain focused on attracting, hiring and developing early career leaders. Our rotational training and development programs, including our General Manager Acceleration Program (GMAP) and Leadership Trainee Program, help us attract, develop and advance a diverse and talented pool of individuals from across our organization. Our Executive Leadership team sponsors these programs, providing visibility and support for the career advancement of our high-potential talent across the organization. Since the beginning of these programs in 2017, 78 leaders have graduated into leadership positions. Additionally, our MBA intern program, with 24 participants since 2019, introduces\n6\nstrong talent to the organization and is a path of opportunity into the GMAP program. We have found that these programs and experiences help ensure that the next generation of leaders build the necessary skills and experiences to be successful in their roles today and in the future.\nWe continue to leverage innovative training methods using mixed mediums to deliver trainings and instruction to our employees across the country. We remain committed to expanding employee participation in learning programs that are relevant to our business strategy and contribute to career advancement for our employees.\nAs we continue to grow as a Company, we are investing in new technology and tools so employees can do their jobs safely and effectively, while providing day-to-day stability and professional development.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer compensation and benefits that help improve our employees' overall financial, physical and emotional wellbeing, as well as recognize hard work with opportunities to grow. Our commitment to paying market competitive wages enables us to attract and hire talent all across the country, including an expansion of many opportunities to work remotely. Our approach to paying for performance supports our focus on pay equity. Our compensation packages are designed to provide employees with a stable and livable wage and growth potential. Our focus on wellness also provides our employees with access to preventative care, advice on financial planning and support for mental health, contributing to our efforts to provide a total rewards package that improves and enhances the lives of our employees\nDifferentiating Capabilities\nTo effectively execute our strategic plan, we prioritize the development and investment in capabilities that will differentiate us in the marketplace. These capabilities include – (1) customer zeal, (2) digital and (3) sustainability.\nCustomer Zeal\nThe goal of customer zeal is to drive customer loyalty by offering differentiated products and services specifically designed to meet our customers’ needs. We believe this increases customer satisfaction and willingness to pay for a higher value service. Customer Zeal is a cultural commitment to enable and empower our employees to own their role in the customer experience.\nTo help our sales team identify specific customer needs and configure the right offering, we use a Priority Based Selling (PBS) technique and our Capture pricing tool nationwide.\n•\nPBS enables us to identify and segment customers’ buying priorities and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings.\n•\nCapture is a cloud-based pricing tool that creates a more professional sales experience, helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale and provides enhanced controls over the price quoting process.\nWe continue to expand our offering of products and services to meet customer demand for a single provider for their environmental service needs. We have made progress on this front, primarily through acquisitions, including the acquisition of US Ecology in May 2022. US Ecology is a leading provider of environmental solutions, offering treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous and specialty waste. For services that we don’t provide, we fulfill demand through our alliance partnerships while maintaining the customer facing relationship.\nTo help ensure a consistent customer experience, we invested in our customer service capabilities and our centralized Customer Experience function. This modern technology provides our customer services employees with the tools and capabilities they need to provide better levels of service through a variety of communication channels. The standardized approach enhances the customer experience and provides us a platform to reduce the cost to service our customers.\nTo help ensure our efforts are making an impact and building customer loyalty, we solicit feedback from our customers, including Net Promoter Score℠, so that every General Manager receives recent, relevant feedback that allows him or her the ability to reach out to customers directly and address issues immediately.\nDigital\nThe goal of our digital priority is to allow us to provide a consistent experience across our business while enabling our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information.\nBy increasing the ease of use and functionality of our web-based market presence, we believe we enhance customer satisfaction, interaction and connectivity while lowering our costs. These tools reinforce to our customers that they can rely on us to handle their recycling and waste service needs in a way that is easy and convenient for them.\n•\nOur website and mobile app are online account management tools, allowing customers access to their accounts and our services.\n7\n•\nOur e-commerce sales channel allows customers to secure services on a real-time basis, provides capabilities to meet our customers' evolving buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel.\nWe are also leveraging technology to digitally connect our customers, drivers, dispatchers, supervisors and trucks via our \"RISE\" dispatch platform and in-cab technology. We are utilizing an agile iterative approach to the development and multi-year roll-out of this technology to ensure durable adoption and an appropriate return on our investment. With the roll-out of this technology we are improving productivity through more real-time routing information and data visualization tools, increasing customer connectivity and enabling automated service verification communications and enhancing the employee experience by providing better tools and technology designed around employee interaction. The rollout of the \"RISE\" in-cab technology enhancements across our collection fleet will continue through 2023.\nSustainability\nThe goal of our differentiating sustainability capabilities is to provide our customers with sustainable solutions that support a cleaner, safer and healthier world. We have long been a leader in environmental services and sustainability. We introduced our Elements of Sustainability, the foundation of our sustainability platform, in 2014. Our elements, Safety, Talent, Climate Leadership and Communities, are deeply integrated into our business and anchor our ambitious 2030 sustainability goals.\nOur Board of Directors’ Sustainability & Corporate Responsibility Committee has oversight responsibility with respect to our sustainability performance, our corporate responsibilities, our role as a socially responsible organization and our enterprise risks, including environmental, climate related risks and opportunities and reputational risks. The Committee meets at least quarterly to be updated on progress and conducts a formal comprehensive review of the Company’s performance in these areas on an annual basis.\nOur 2030 Sustainability Goals\nAs we grow, so does our opportunity to make a meaningful, positive impact on the environment and society. Our ambitious 2030 goals are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n(1)\nand our greenhouse gas reduction goal is aligned with The Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change adopted in 2015. Each goal is aligned with one of the Company's elements of sustainability. Together they are designed to significantly benefit the environment and society, while enhancing the foundation and profitability of our business for the long-term.\n•\nSafety Amplified:\nAchieve zero annual employee fatalities\n•\nIncident Reduction:\nReduce OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) to 2.0 or less by 2030\n•\nEngaged Workforce:\nAchieve and maintain employee engagement scores at or above 88 by 2030\n•\nScience Based Target:\nReduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2030\n(2)\n, approved by SBTi\n(3)\n, with an interim goal of achieving a 10% reduction by 2025\n•\nCircular Economy:\nIncrease recovery of key materials by 40% on a combined basis by 2030\n(2)\n•\nRenewable Energy:\nIncrease beneficial reuse of biogas by 50% by 2030\n(2)\n•\nCharitable Giving:\nCreate sustainable neighborhoods through strong community partnerships for 45 million people by 2030\n(2)\nWe believe that reducing our impact on the planet and improving the quality of life for its inhabitants are the right things to do, and they are also necessary actions to ensure a vibrant future for our organization.\nRefer to our Sustainability Report for our progress toward our 2030 sustainability goals, and refer to our full suite of climate-related sustainability reporting for updates regarding our progress toward our climate goals, including Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), SASB, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and CDP Climate Change, all of which can be found at investor.republicservices.com/sustainability. The information contained on our website shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other filing we make under the Exchange Act.\n(1) We have aligned our 2030 goals with the following UN Sustainable Development Goals: (8) Decent Work and Economic Growth, (11) Sustainable Cities and Communities, (12) Responsible Consumption and Production and (13) Climate Action.\n(2) Data points used 2017 as the baseline year.\n(3) SBTi, or Science Based Targets initiative, is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).\n8\nCash Utilization Strategy\nWe take a consistent and balanced approach to capital allocation to drive long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders. The predictability of our free cash flows allows us to efficiently execute our capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in acquisitions and returning free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are committed to an efficient capital structure and maintaining our investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt, which was rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, BBB+ by Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. Such ratings have allowed us, and should continue to allow us, to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.\nWe manage our free cash flow by ensuring that capital expenditures and operating asset levels are appropriate in light of our existing business and growth opportunities and by closely managing our working capital.\nDividends\nIn July 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.495 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 8% over the prior year. Over the last five years, our dividends have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.7%. We expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends and may consider additional dividend increases if we believe they will enhance shareholder value.\nShare Repurchases\nIn October 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization effective starting January 1, 2021 and extending through December 31, 2023. Share repurchases under the current program may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. While the Board of Directors has approved the program, the timing of any purchases, the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management, at its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. On a quarterly basis, our Board of Directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock and the parameters around which we repurchase our shares. Refer to\nItem 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nfor repurchase authority remaining as of December 31, 2022.\nShareholder Value\nWe are committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth while continually improving returns on invested capital. Our incentive compensation programs are aligned with these objectives at all levels of management. We have an active shareholder outreach program and routinely interact with shareholders on a number of matters, including environmental, social, governance, talent and executive compensation.\nManagement Team\nWe believe that building and blending a diverse team of strong industry veterans, along with talented people from other industries who bring unique skill sets, will contribute to what we call our Composite Strength. Composite Strength combines the vast, varied experience and capability of both strong environmental services industry veterans and talented people from other industries. Additionally, Composite Strength helps ensure the continuity of leadership and preservation of institutional knowledge, while also bringing in skills and new ideas from other companies outside of our industry - many of them from leading companies.\nJon Vander Ark\nwas named Chief Executive Officer in 2021.

Before joining Dell, Ms. Hodges worked as a consultant for McKinsey & Company.\nKatrina Liddell\nwas named Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer in June 2021. In this role, she is responsible for leading the Company’s Sales organization, which includes Field Sales, National Accounts, Manufacturing and Environmental Services and Municipal Services. She also oversees the Customer Resource Centers. Prior to joining the Company, Ms. Liddell held the role of President, Global Forwarding and Expedite for XPO Logistics Inc., a global transportation and contract logistics company. Before joining XPO, Ms. Liddell spent 14 years with Johnson Controls International, where she held senior leadership roles in enterprise account management, vertical market development, operations, product development and customer relations. Ms. Liddell serves on the Board of Directors of The Kristine Pettoni Foundation.\nTim Stuart\nwas named Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer in May 2019. Prior to his current role, Mr. Stuart served as Executive Vice President, Operations from January 2016 to May 2019, where he was responsible for maximizing field performance, executing the operating plan and achieving financial and operational results across the Company. Mr. Stuart has over 20 years of experience in the waste industry. He previously served as the Company’s East Region President from September 2013 to January 2016. He joined Republic in April 2006 as Director of Operations and has held a variety of roles with the Company, including Area President, Vice President of Customer Experience and Region Vice President.\nOur local and area management teams have extensive industry experience in growing, operating and managing environmental services companies and have substantial experience in their local geographic markets. This allows us to quickly respond to and meet our customers’ needs and stay in touch with local businesses and municipalities. We believe our strong area management teams allow us to effectively and efficiently drive our initiatives and help ensure consistency throughout the organization. Our area management teams and area presidents have extensive authority and responsibility over operations within their respective geographic markets. As a result of retaining experienced managers with extensive knowledge of and involvement in their local communities, we are proactive in anticipating customers’ needs and adjusting to changes in our markets. We also seek to implement the best practices of our various business units throughout our operations to continue improving our operations and our operating margins.\nComprehensive Environmental Services\nWe serve customers with a strong, vertically-integrated operating platform and offer a complete set of products and services, including the collection and processing of recyclable, solid waste and industrial waste materials; transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste streams; and other environmental solutions. We offer a wide array of products and services with a proven track record in safety, compliance and environmental stewardship.\nRecycling & Solid Waste Services\nWe have a strong, national, vertically-integrated operating platform that allows us to compete more effectively and efficiently in the local markets in which we operate. Where appropriate, we seek to achieve a high rate of internalization by controlling material streams from the point of collection through recycling processing or disposal. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 68% of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfills we own or operate (internalization). Our fully integrated markets generally have a lower cost of operations and more favorable cash flows than our markets that are not fully integrated. Through acquisitions, landfill operating agreements and other market development activities, we create market-specific, vertically-integrated operations typically consisting of one or more collection operations, transfer stations and landfills. We also operate recycling centers in markets where diversion of waste is a priority, customers are willing to pay for the service and we can earn an appropriate return on our investment.\n10\nCollection Services\nWe provide residential, small-container and large-container collection services through 353 collection operations. In 2022, approximately 69% of our total revenue was derived from our collection business, of which approximately 20% of our total revenue related to residential services, approximately 29% related to small-container services and approximately 20% related to large-container services.\nOur residential collection business involves the curbside collection of material for transport to transfer stations, or directly to landfills, recycling centers, or organics processing facilities. We typically perform residential collection services under contracts with municipalities, which we generally secure through competitive bids, which give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the municipalities. These contracts usually range in duration from one to five years, although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods. We also perform residential services on a subscription basis, in which individual households contract directly with us. The fees received for subscription residential collection are based primarily on the market, collection frequency, type of service, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal. In general, subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly in advance by the customers receiving the service.\nIn our small-container business, we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes. We typically perform small-container collection services under one- to three-year service agreements, and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market, collection frequency, type of equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the material collected, transportation costs and the cost of processing or disposal. Our small-container services are typically offered to small business complexes, multi-family housing and strip malls and include industries such as restaurants, retail, real-estate and professional and other services.\nOur large-container collection business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships. For the recurring portion, we supply our customers with recycling and waste containers of varying sizes and rent compactors to large generators of material. We typically perform the collection services under one- to three-year service agreements, and fees are determined based on a number of factors including the market, collection frequency, type of equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the material collected, transportation costs and the cost of disposal. Our recurring large-container services are typically offered to larger facilities, hotels and office buildings and include industries such as manufacturing, retail, hospitality, professional and other services.\nFor the temporary portion of our large-container collection business, the majority of the material relates to construction and demolition activities and is typically event-driven. We provide temporary collection services on a contractual basis with terms ranging from a single pickup to one-year or longer.\nTransfer Services\nWe own or operate 233 transfer stations. Revenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees, which accounted for approximately 5% of our revenue during 2022. Our collection operations deposit material at these transfer stations, as do other private and municipal haulers, for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or recycling centers. Transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost-effective means to consolidate material and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfills with an additional mechanism to extend their geographic reach.\nWhen our own collection operations use our transfer stations, this improves internalization by allowing us to retain fees we would otherwise pay to third-party disposal sites. It also allows us to manage costs associated with material disposal because: (1) transfer trucks have larger capacities than collection trucks, allowing us to deliver more material to the landfill or processing center in each trip; (2) material is accumulated and compacted at strategically located transfer stations to increase efficiency; and (3) we can retain volume by managing the material to one of our own landfills or processing centers rather than to a competitor’s.\nRecycling Processing Services\nWe own or operate 71 recycling centers. These centers generate revenue through the and sale of old corrugated containers (OCC), old newsprint (ONP), aluminum, glass and other materials, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenue during 2022. Approximately 81% of our total recycling center volume is fiber based and includes OCC, ONP and other mixed paper. During 2022, we processed and sold 2.0 million tons, excluding glass and organics, from our recycling centers. An additional 2.0 million tons were collected by us and delivered to third parties. We are investing in innovative recycling technology and have expanded our organics operations to help customers meet their diversion goals. We processed 1.0 million and sold 0.3 million tons of organic materials, respectively, from our recycling centers in 2022.\nChanging market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities would change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately $10 million.\n11\nIn certain instances, we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or large-container customers, which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities, a fixed contractual rate or other measures. We also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at third-party processing facilities.\nAs consumer demand for recycling services has increased, we have met that demand by integrating recycling components across our collection service offerings. Our goal is to provide a complete material stream management solution to our customers in a vertically integrated, environmentally sustainable way.\nWe continue to invest in proven technologies to control costs and to simplify and streamline recycling for our customers. For example, robotics and advanced sorting equipment, such as disk screens, magnets and optical sorters, identifies and separates different kinds of paper, metals, plastics and other materials to increase efficiency and maximize our recycling efforts.\nLandfill Services\nWe own or operate 206 active landfills. Our landfill tipping fees charged to third parties accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue during 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had estimated permitted acres of 40,400 and estimated total available disposal capacity of 5.0 billion in-place cubic yards. The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept non-hazardous special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and contaminated soils.\nMost of our active landfill sites have the potential for expanded disposal capacity beyond the currently permitted acreage. We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal demand, we are seeking to expand permitted capacity at certain landfills; however, all proposed or future expansions may not be permitted.\nRepublic is committed to harnessing landfill gas, the natural byproduct of decomposing waste, and converting it to energy. The use of landfill gas provides economic and environmental benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the capture and use of methane. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 73 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. The majority of these projects were developed and are owned by a third party.\nWe also have responsibility for 128 closed landfills, for which we have associated closure and post-closure obligations.\nEnvironmental Solutions\nWe have the capabilities to address the complex sustainability needs of our customers. Our environmental solutions offerings include collection, treatment, consolidation, disposal and recycling of hazardous and non-hazardous waste; field and industrial services; equipment rental; emergency response and standby services; and in-plant services. Environmental solutions volume is generated by the daily operations of industrial, petrochemical and refining facilities and oil and natural gas exploration and production sites, including maintenance, plant turnarounds and capital projects. Volume also is generated by private and government funded projects including site remediation, redevelopment or emergency spill response. In 2022, approximately 9% of our revenue was derived from environmental solutions.\nWaste Treatment & Disposal\nWe own or operate 6 active hazardous waste landfills, 9 active energy waste landfills, 3 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 20 treatment, storage and disposal facilities, 6 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells. We recycle, treat and dispose of hazardous and non-hazardous industrial wastes. The waste handled include substances which are classified as “hazardous” because of their corrosive, ignitable, reactive or toxic properties and other wastes subject to federal, state and provincial environmental regulation. The waste we handle comes in solid, liquid and sludge form and can be received in a variety of containerized and bulk forms and transported to our facilities by truck and rail.\nWe also operate thermal desorption units that recover oil and metal bearing catalyst from refinery and other organic and oil-based waste. The recycled oil and recycled catalyst are sold to third parties.\nField Services\nOur field services include a wide range of specialty and total waste management services provided to refineries, chemical plants, manufacturing plants and other government, commercial and industrial facilities either on-site or at our network of facilities. These services include industrial cleaning and maintenance, retail services, lab pack, site remediation, equipment cleaning and maintenance services, specialty equipment rental, transportation and emergency response.\n12\nAs an integral part of our services, we employ highly trained staff and operate a network of service centers that characterize, package and collect hazardous and non-hazardous wastes from customers and transport such wastes to and between our facilities for treatment or bulking for shipment to final disposal locations.\nOther Services\nOther revenue consists primarily of National Accounts revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a competitive industry. Competition in the environmental services industry comes from a few other large, national publicly-owned companies, several regional publicly- and privately-owned companies and thousands of small privately-owned companies. In any given market, competitors may have larger operations and greater resources. In addition, we compete with municipalities that maintain material collection or disposal operations. These municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing.\nWe compete for collection accounts primarily based on our product offering, quality of service and price. From time-to-time, our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract. Our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies. This may have an effect on our future revenue and profitability.\nSeasonality and Severe Weather\nOur operating revenues tend to be somewhat higher in the summer months, primarily due to higher volumes of construction and demolition waste. The volumes of large-container and residential recycling and waste in certain regions of the country also tend to increase during the summer months. Our second and third quarter revenues and results of operations typically reflect this seasonality.\nWe provide essential recycling and solid waste collection and disposal services in the communities we serve and our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather and natural disasters, which could increase the volume of material collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of material, reduce the volume of material delivered to our disposal sites or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities and may increase with the physical impacts of climate change. The impacts from adverse weather and natural disasters have the potential to last several months and to affect several facilities. We have business continuity plans in place for severe weather, natural disasters and other emergencies—hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, winter storms, earthquakes and wildfires, among others—to help limit disruptions in our operations and\nhelp\nensure the continuity of our services. Our operations can also be favorably affected by severe weather and natural disasters, which could increase the volume of material in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services. Refer to our TCFD Report for more information on climate impacts and our risk management strategies, available at investor.republicservices.com/sustainability. The information contained on our website shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other filing we make under the Exchange Act.\nRegulation\nOur facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, recycling centers, certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other equipment and facilities that we own or operate. These permits are subject to denial, revocation, modification and renewal in certain circumstances. Any revocation, modification or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on us. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement, which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew any of our operating permits, obtain injunctions, or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations, including criminal penalties. The United States EPA and various other federal, state, provincial and local authorities administer these regulations. Regulations with respect to hazardous waste are particularly relevant for our Group 3 reportable segment that provides treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous waste.\nIn order to comply with these regulations, we must incur substantial capital expenditures relating to our vehicles, landfills, transfer stations, recycling centers and in connection with our capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation activities. Compliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, including changes relating to per- and\n13\npolyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as PFAS) and other chemicals of emerging concern, and limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste, could increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures.\nA decrease in regulation may lower barriers to entry for our competitors. Further, we compete with counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities, have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing.\nWe strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, from time to time we have been issued citations or notices from governmental authorities that have resulted in the need to expend funds for remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities or in the need to expend funds for fines, penalties or settlements. Citations and notices may be issued in the future, notwithstanding our strong regulatory compliance efforts. We have established final capping, closure, post-closure and remediation reserves that we believe, based on currently available information, will be adequate to cover our current estimates of regulatory costs; however, actual costs may exceed our reserves.\nFederal Regulation\nThe following summarizes the primary federal, environmental and occupational health and safety-related statutes that affect our facilities and operations:\n•\nThe Solid Waste Disposal Act, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n(RCRA). RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste, and requires states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste in sanitary landfills.\nSubtitle C of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of hazardous waste, and Subtitle D of RCRA establishes a framework for regulating the disposal of municipal solid waste. Regulations under Subtitle C set requirements for hazardous waste generators, transporters and treatment, storage and disposal facilities. Regulations under Subtitle D currently include minimum comprehensive solid waste management criteria and guidelines, including location restrictions, facility design and operating criteria, final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, financial assurance standards, groundwater monitoring requirements and corrective action standards. The EPA may authorize states to implement certain hazardous waste requirements of Subtitle C, and if a state program does not exist, the EPA directly implements the hazardous waste requirements. Nearly all of the states in which we operate have implemented permit programs pursuant to RCRA and Subtitles C and D. These state permit programs may include landfill requirements that are more stringent than those of Subtitles C and D. Our failure to comply with any of these environmental requirements at any of our locations may lead to temporary or permanent loss of an operating permit, which would result in costs in connection with securing new permits, reduced revenue from lost operational time and increased third party disposal costs.\nAll of our planned landfill expansions and new landfill development projects have been engineered to meet or exceed Subtitles C and D requirements, as applicable. Operating and design criteria for existing operations have been modified to comply with these regulations. Compliance with Subtitles C and D regulations has resulted in increased capital expenditures and operating costs and may in the future require substantial additional expenditures in addition to other costs normally associated with our waste management activities.\n•\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980\n(CERCLA). CERCLA, among other things, provides for the cleanup of sites from which there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. CERCLA may impose strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleanup and for damages to natural resources upon current owners and operators of a site, parties who were owners or operators of a site at the time the hazardous substances were disposed of, parties who transported the hazardous substances to a site and parties who arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site. Under the authority of CERCLA and its implementing regulations, detailed requirements apply to the manner and degree of investigation and remediation of facilities and sites where hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment. Liability under CERCLA is not dependent on the existence or disposal of only hazardous wastes, but also can be based upon the existence of small quantities of more than 700 substances currently characterized by the EPA as hazardous, many of which are found in common household waste. The EPA may also designate additional substances as hazardous; in 2022, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would designate certain PFAS as hazardous substances. Among other things, CERCLA authorizes the federal government to investigate and remediate sites at which hazardous substances have been or are threatened to be released into the environment, or to order persons potentially liable for the cleanup of the hazardous substances to do so themselves. In addition, the EPA has established a National Priorities List of sites at which hazardous substances have been, or are threatened to be, released and which require investigation or cleanup.\n14\nCERCLA liability is strict liability. It can be founded upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of unintentional, non-negligent or lawful action, of hazardous substances, including very small quantities of such substances. Thus, even if we have never knowingly transported or received hazardous substances, it is possible that hazardous substances have been deposited or released at landfills or other facilities that we presently or historically have owned or operated, or at properties owned by third parties to which we have transported waste. Therefore, we could be liable under CERCLA for the cost of cleaning up, or protecting against the release of, such hazardous substances at such sites and for damages to natural resources, even if those substances were deposited at our facilities before we acquired or operated them. The costs of a CERCLA cleanup can be very expensive and can include the costs of disposing of hazardous substances at appropriately-licensed facilities. Given the difficulty of obtaining insurance for environmental impairment liability, any such liability could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n•\nThe Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972\n(the Clean Water Act). This act regulates the discharge of pollutants from a variety of sources, including solid waste disposal sites, into streams, rivers and other waters of the United States. Runoff from our landfills and transfer stations that is discharged into surface waters through discrete conveyances must be covered by discharge permits that generally require us to conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, to reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. Storm water discharge regulations under the Clean Water Act require a permit for certain construction activities and for runoff from industrial operations and facilities, which may affect our operations. If a landfill or transfer station discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by that treatment works. In addition, states may adopt groundwater protection programs under the Clean Water Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act that could affect the manner in which our landfills monitor and control their waste management activities. Furthermore, if development at any of our facilities alters or affects wetlands, we may be required to secure permits before such development starts. In these situations, permitting agencies may require mitigation of wetland impacts.\n•\nThe Clean Air Act.\nThe Clean Air Act imposes limitations on emissions from various sources, including landfills. In 1996, the EPA promulgated regulations that require large municipal solid waste landfills to install landfill gas monitoring systems along with landfill gas control systems unless emissions are below established thresholds. These regulations apply to landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification on or after May 30, 1991, and, principally, to landfills that can accommodate 2.5 million cubic meters or more of municipal solid waste. The regulations apply whether the landfills are active or closed. The date by which each affected landfill must have a gas collection and control system installed and made operational varies depending on calculated emission rates at the landfill. In July 2016, the EPA issued final amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or after July 17, 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain non-methane gases, which are recognized as greenhouse gases. In a separate rule finalized at the same time, the EPA issued updates to its 1996 Emission Guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills. Both actions were part of the Obama Administration's Climate Action Plan - Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. As part of the Biden Administration's focus on climate change, the EPA has taken further steps to implement these regulations. These and other efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems, with resulting capital or operating costs. Many state regulatory agencies also currently require monitoring systems for the collection and control of certain landfill gas. Certain of these state agencies are also implementing greenhouse gas control regulations that would also apply to landfill gas emissions. See Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n–\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other governmental regulations could impose costs on our operations, the magnitude of which is difficult to estimate\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, our vehicle fleet also may become subject to higher efficiency standards or other carbon-emission restrictions. Over the past decade, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have adopted regulations mandating the reduction of vehicle tail pipe emissions as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The regulations take the form of fuel economy standards. The EPA and the NHTSA have developed fuel economy standards in two vehicle categories: (1) passenger automobiles and light-duty trucks (collectively, light-duty vehicles); and (2) heavy-duty trucks, including solid waste collection vehicles and tractor trailers. We own and operate vehicles in both categories. For light-duty vehicles, in May 2010 the EPA and the NHTSA finalized fuel economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016. In October 2011, the EPA and the NHTSA initiated a second round of rulemaking for light-duty vehicles for model years 2017 through 2025. In 2018, the EPA and the NHTSA proposed to revise the light-duty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent; final action on the proposal occurred in 2020 but has been challenged in court. In 2021, the EPA issued a rule further setting the standards for model years 2023 to 2026, making them more stringent; that rule has also been challenged in court. In August 2011, the EPA and the NHTSA finalized standards for heavy-duty trucks, including solid waste collection\n15\nvehicles and tractor trailers, for model years 2014 through 2018. In August 2016, the EPA and the NHTSA jointly issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavy-duty vehicles through model-year 2027. In August 2021, the EPA announced its intent to move forward with a Clean Trucks Plan, which would involve setting emissions standards for model years 2027 and beyond and the EPA released a proposed rule on March 28, 2022.\n•\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970\n(OSHA). This act authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor to promulgate occupational safety and health standards. A number of these standards, including standards for notices of hazardous chemicals and the handling of asbestos, apply to our facilities and operations.\nState and Local Regulation\nEach state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States also have adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. In addition, our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example, several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs, the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally, laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills, including yard waste, food waste, newspapers, beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries, electronic wastes and household appliances, have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others. Some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting “extended producer responsibility” regulations, which are designed to obligate producers to fund the post-use life cycle of their products by providing recycling programs for their products. State and municipal governments also have enacted or may enact “organic diversion” regulations that require food waste to be managed separately from the other waste streams, similar to the rules recently enacted in California. Several states have also enacted or are considering “minimum recycled content” regulations mandating certain minimum post-consumer recycled content in certain types of packaging, including California. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction and recycling also have been considered, or are under consideration by, the United States Congress and the EPA. These regulations may present new opportunities to offer sustainable environmental services to our customers but may require investment of time, effort and money to be able to offer these new solutions and expose us to additional regulatory requirements and competition from others offering these services.\nTo construct, operate and expand a landfill, we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and land use approvals. These permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with, are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ groups, may be subject to periodic renewal, and are subject to denial, modification, non-renewal and revocation by the issuing agency. Significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes. In connection with our acquisition of existing landfills, we may be required to spend considerable time, effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity.\nCanadian Hazardous Waste Regulation\nCertain of our Group 3 operations and facilities are subject to, among other regulations, Canadian hazardous waste regulations. The Canadian federal government regulates issues within federal jurisdiction, including activities that cross provincial boundaries or affect Canada’s relations with other nations. The Canadian provinces also have jurisdiction over environmental matters within their respective boundaries, including primary responsibility for regulation and management of hazardous waste.\nThe main federal laws governing hazardous waste management are the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) and the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is the federal agency with responsibility for environmental matters. CEPA charges ECCC and Health Canada with the protection of human health and the environment and seeks to control the production, importation and use of substances in Canada and their impact on the environment. The Cross-border Movement of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations under CEPA control the transboundary movement of hazardous waste and hazardous recyclable materials. These regulations require that anyone proposing to export or import hazardous waste or hazardous recyclable materials or transport them through Canada notify ECCC and obtain a permit to do so.\nCertain of our facilities are subject to the Québec Environment Quality Act, the Ontario Environmental Protection Act or the Alberta Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and their respective regulations. These statutes and regulations regulate the generation, collection, characterization, transport, storage, treatment, recovery and disposal of hazardous wastes, establish the requirements for waste management facilities and govern actual or potential releases of contaminants in the environment, such as air emissions and soil, groundwater and surface water contamination issues.\n16\nHazardous waste transporters are required to hold a permit to operate under the provincial regulations and are also subject to the safety and reporting requirements of the Canadian Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992.\nMaritime Regulations\nOur Group 3 operations own and use 37 vessels registered under the United States flag. Accordingly, we are subject to various United States federal, state and local statutes and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of our vessels. Our United States-flag vessels are subject to the direct jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard, the United States Customs and Border Protection and the United States Maritime Administration as well as other federal and state agencies. We are also subject to international laws and conventions and the local laws of foreign jurisdictions where we operate.\nA portion of the operations of our standby services business within Group 3 is conducted in the United States coastwise trade. This is a protected market that is subject to United States cabotage laws that impose certain restrictions on the ownership and operation of vessels in the United States coastwise trade. These laws are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. Chapters 121, 505 and 551 and the related regulations, which are commonly referred to collectively as the “Jones Act.” The Jones Act restricts transportation of merchandise by water or by land and water, either directly or via a foreign port, between points in the United States and certain of its island territories. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in United States coastwise trade be owned and operated by United States citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act, be built in and registered under the laws of the United States and manned by predominantly United States Citizen crews. We have systems in place designed to assist with monitoring and maintaining compliance with the ownership requirements of the Jones Act.\nAll of our offshore vessels are subject to either United States or international safety and classification standards and sometimes both. United States-flag vessels, barges and crew boats are required to undergo periodic inspections pursuant to United States Coast Guard regulations.\nWe are also subject to the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPFS Code), an amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as implemented in the Maritime Transportation and Security Act of 2002 to align United States regulations with those of SOLAS and the ISPS Code. The ISPS Code provides that owners or operators of certain vessels and facilities must provide security and security plans for their vessels and facilities and obtain appropriate certification of compliance. Under the ISPS Code, we perform worldwide security assessments, risk analyses and develop vessel and required port facility security plans to enhance safe and secure vessel and facility operations. Additionally, we have developed security annexes for those United States-flag vessels that transit or work in waters designated as high risk by the United States Coast Guard pursuant to the latest revision of Marsec Directive 104-6.\nOther Regulations\nSome of our facilities and operations are subject to the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA) and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA). TSCA regulates the treatment, storage and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and asbestos. The AEA assigns the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) regulatory authority over receipt, possession, use and transfer of certain radioactive materials, including disposal. The USNRC has adopted regulations for licensing commercial low-level radioactive waste regulated under the AEA for disposal and has delegated regulatory authority to certain states, including states where one or more of our facilities are located. The USNRC and United States Department of Transportation regulate the transport of radioactive materials. Shippers must comply with both the general requirements for hazardous materials transportation and specific requirements for transporting radioactive materials.\nMany of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleum-based products. These tanks can be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing, upgrading, closure and removal. In the event of leaks or releases from these tanks, these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated. If underground storage tanks we own or operate leak, we could be liable for response costs and, if the leakage migrates onto the property of others, we could be liable for damages to third parties. We are unaware of facts indicating that issues of compliance with regulations related to underground storage tanks will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWith regard to our solid waste transportation operations, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board and are regulated by the Federal Highway Administration, Office of Motor Carriers and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters. Various state and local government authorities have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county, or other jurisdictional lines. In 1978, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out-of-state solid waste is unconstitutional; however, states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation, imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional. In 2007, however, the United States Supreme Court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly-owned and publicly-\n17\noperated waste facility. A number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries. Other governments may enact similar regulations in the future. These regulations may cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal, thereby adversely affecting our operations and our financial results.\nWe are engaged in 73 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects. The production of renewable fuel through certain of these projects is incentivized by the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, which was authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and expanded through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Oil refiners and importers are required through the RFS program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits, known as renewable identification numbers (RINs), from renewable fuel producers. The amount of RIN credits generated by each gallon of renewable fuel depends on the process and feedstock used to create the specific renewable fuel. There is a market for RINs and, as we and/or our partners produce RFS-compliant renewable fuel, RINs are generated and sold to parties purchasing such RINs to achieve compliance with the RFS program.\nClimate and Sustainability Trends\nJurisdictions have been updating climate policies toward the goal of reporting and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a broad range of sustainability initiatives. We believe reducing our impact on the planet and improving the quality of life of its inhabitants are the right things to do, and have continually committed to heightened emissions reduction goals. Taking into account the challenges associated with quantifying environmental services emissions precisely, we evaluate and offer strategic opportunities to provide our customers with sustainable solutions to reduce their GHG emissions as new regulatory and business developments related to concerns about climate change arise. As a provider of a highly regulated public service, we recognize the importance of broad stakeholder engagement in these endeavors, and we actively seek opportunities for discussion on more sustainable materials management practices. In addition, we cooperate with and support initiatives at the federal and state level in support of legislation that encourages sustainable practices including the production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels and electricity and the processing of recyclables and organics.\nWe have long been a leader in sustainability as it relates to environmental services and expect to maintain this reputation. Our sustainability commitments, as well as our progress toward our current goals, are published in our Sustainability Report and accompanying reports and can be found at investor.republicservices.com/sustainability. The information contained on our website shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other filing we make under the Exchange Act.\nLiabilities Established for Landfill and Environmental Costs\nWe have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs, which include landfill site final capping, closure and post-closure costs. We periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of Subtitles C and D of RCRA, and we adjust our amortization rates used to expense final capping, closure and post-closure costs accordingly. Based on current information and regulatory requirements, we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate; however, environmental laws may change, and our recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations, future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us. Refer to the\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Intended Uses of Cash\nsection of our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and to Note 2,\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nLiability Insurance and Bonding\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the possible risk of liabilities arising out of our operations, including damages to the environment, property, employees or the general public, or those resulting from cyber incidents. We focus on operating safely and prudently, but occasionally we receive claims, alleging damages, negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work, which resulted in harm to the environment, property, employees or the general public. These liabilities can be significant. We also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements. We maintain various policies of insurance that, subject to limitations, exclusions, or deductibles, provide coverage for these types of claims. While we believe the amount of insurance is appropriate for our type of business, such insurance may not be adequate, in scope or amount, in the event of a major loss, and we may be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may choose not to continue to maintain the insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage cost prohibitive.\n18\nAccruals for deductibles are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. Due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance. As we assume more risk through higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense.\nIn the normal course of business, we also purchase surety bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit, or marketable securities deposits in connection with, among other things, municipal residential collection contracts, financial assurance for closure and post-closure of landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance.\nAvailability of Reports and Other Information\nOur corporate website is\nrepublicservices.com\n.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements are:\n•\ngeneral economic and market conditions, including inflation and changes in fuel, interest rates, labor, risk, health insurance and other variable costs that generally are not within our control, and our exposure to credit and counterparty risk;\n•\nfluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers;\n•\nour ability to integrate the operations of US Ecology into our operations and to realize the intended benefits of such acquisition\n•\nwhether our estimates and assumptions concerning critical accounting issues are correct or appropriate, including estimates and assumptions concerning selected balance sheet accounts, income tax accounts, final capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, available airspace, projected costs and expenses related to our landfills and property and equipment, fair values of acquired assets and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions and labor, fuel rates and economic and inflationary trends;\n•\ncompetition and demand for services in the environmental services industry;\n•\nprice increases to our customers, which may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs, including labor, third-party disposal and fuel and may cause us to lose volume;\n•\nour ability to manage growth and execute our growth strategy;\n19\n•\nour compliance with, and future changes in, environmental and flow control regulations and our ability to obtain approvals from regulatory agencies in connection with operating and expanding our landfills;\n•\nthe impact on us of our substantial indebtedness, including on our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to finance our operations and growth strategy and to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements;\n•\nour ability to retain our investment grade ratings for our debt;\n•\nour dependence on key personnel;\n•\nour dependence on large, long-term collection, transfer and disposal contracts;\n•\nthe capital intensive nature of our business, which may consume cash in excess of cash flow from operations;\n•\nexposure to liabilities or losses, to the extent not adequately covered by insurance, which could result in substantial expenses;\n•\nrisks associated with undisclosed liabilities of acquired businesses;\n•\nrisks associated with pending and future legal proceedings, including litigation, audits or investigations brought by or before any governmental body;\n•\nsevere weather conditions, including those brought about by climate change, which could impair our financial results by causing increased costs, loss of revenue, reduced operational efficiency or disruptions to our operations;\n•\ncompliance with existing and future legal and regulatory requirements, including changes relating to PFAS and other chemicals of emerging concern and limitations or bans on disposal of certain types of wastes or on the transportation of waste, which could limit our ability to conduct or grow our business, increase our costs to operate or require additional capital expenditures;\n•\nour ability to achieve reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions and our other sustainability goals;\n•\nsafety and operational risks, including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties;\n•\npotential increases in our costs if we are required to provide additional funding to any multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute or if a withdrawal event (including our voluntary withdrawal, which we consider from time to time, or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer pension plan) occurs with respect to any such plan;\n•\nthe negative impact on our operations of union organizing campaigns, work stoppages or labor shortages;\n•\nthe negative effect that trends toward requiring recycling, waste reduction at the source and prohibiting the disposal of certain types of wastes could have on volumes of waste going to landfills;\n•\nchanges by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other accounting regulatory bodies to generally accepted accounting principles or policies;\n•\nthe impact of United States and international tax laws and regulations on our business;\n•\nrisks related to interruptions and breaches of our information technology systems that could adversely affect, or temporarily disable, all or a portion of our operations or have a negative effect on our infrastructure;\n•\nthe negative impact that a cyber-security incident could have on our business and our relationships with customers and employees; and\n•\nacts of war, riots or terrorism, including the continuing war on terrorism, as well as actions taken or to be taken by the United States or other governments as a result of further acts or threats of terrorism and the impact of these acts on economic, financial and social conditions in the United States.\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Refer to the Risk Factors in this Item 1A for further discussion regarding our exposure to risks. You should be aware that any forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which we make it. Additionally, new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, or to assess the impact such risk factors might have on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference, as the case may be, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n20\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nThe environmental services industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources, flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively.\nWe principally compete with large national waste management companies, numerous municipalities and numerous regional and local companies. Competition for collection accounts is typically based on the quality of services, ease of doing business and/or price. Competition for disposal business is primarily based on geographic location, quality of operations and price. One of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do. Further, many counties and municipalities that operate their own collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue and greater opportunities for tax-exempt financing. Our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste. In certain markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill, our collection operations may have difficulty competing effectively. If we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues, it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals increase our operating expenses, and we may not be able to recover such cost increases from our customers.\nWe depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection, transfer, disposal and other environmental services. Fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control, including geopolitical developments, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, changes in refinery operations, supply and demand for oil and gas, war, terrorism and unrest in oil-producing countries, adverse weather and regional production patterns. Due to contractual or market factors, we may not be able to offset increased fuel costs resulting from such volatility through fuel recovery fees. Our fuel costs were $631.1 million in 2022, or 4.7% of revenue, compared to $383.0 million in 2021, or 3.4% of revenue.\nAt current consumption levels, a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately $27 million on an annual basis. Offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers. At current participation rates, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately $31 million. A substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could materially affect our revenue and cost of operations.\nOver the last decade, regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles. The renewable fuel standards that the EPA sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses. It is difficult to predict the quantity of renewable fuel volumes that the EPA will mandate for future years. These regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use.\nPart of our fleet of vehicles is powered by CNG and we also operate CNG fueling stations. We have invested higher upfront capital costs in order to purchase and support our CNG vehicles and fueling stations in order to reduce our overall fleet operating costs through lower fuel expenses and to create a competitive advantage in communities that focus on protecting the environment. CNG is not yet widely adopted in North America. As the CNG industry develops, new regulations, the availability of alternative fuel technologies, fluctuations in the price or availability of CNG or reductions in tax incentives for the use of CNG vehicles could substantially affect our revenue and costs of operations and reduce the benefits sought by investing in CNG vehicles and fueling stations.\nOur operations also require the use of products (such as liners at our landfills) whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals. An increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products, which would increase our operating and capital costs. Petrochemical prices, and hence our operating and capital costs, may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals. We are also susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors.\nFluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard, plastics, aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties. Our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials. The resale and purchase prices of, and market demand for, recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control. For instance, in 2017 the Chinese government imposed strict limits on the import of recyclable materials, including by restricting the amount of contaminants allowed in imported recycled paper. These limitations significantly decreased the global demand for recyclable materials and resulted in lower commodity prices. Significant price fluctuations or increased operating costs may affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations\n21\nand cash flows. In 2022, approximately 81% of our recycling center volume was fiber based and included OCC, ONP and other mixed paper.\nAt current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately $10 million. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could materially affect our revenue and operating income. Although we have entered into hedging agreements to help offset volatility in recycled commodity prices in the past, we may not enter into these agreements in the future.\nAcute and chronic weather events, including those brought about by climate change, may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection, transfer, disposal and other environmental services we provide.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by extreme weather events, changing weather patterns and rising mean temperature and sea levels, some of which we are already experiencing. For example, we have operations in multiple states that are affected by hurricanes and we have seen the impact of storms and associated flooding in our day-to-day operations and our infrastructure. Changing weather patterns and rising temperatures are expected to result in more severe heat waves, fires, storms and other extreme weather events. Any of these factors could increase the volume of material collected or processed under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), impede our employees' and equipment's ability to operate, disrupt our supply chain, delay the development of landfill capacity, or reduce the volume of material generated by our customers. In addition, adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations, which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods.\nThe environmental services industry is a capital-intensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations, which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business.\nOur ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital. If our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the effect of inflation and business growth, it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend. Additionally, if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations, the amount we spend on capital, capping, closure, post-closure, environmental remediation and other items will increase. Our cash needs also will increase if the expenditures for capping, closure, post-closure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates, which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal, state, provincial, or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control. Increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our facilities, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits required for our operations because permits to operate new landfills, transfer stations and other facilities, or to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills, increase acceptable volume at transfer stations or otherwise increase the capabilities of our facilities, have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain. Permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning, environmental and other regulations. These permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures. Local communities and citizen groups, adjacent landowners, governmental agencies and others may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need, allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject, or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage. Such actions could also create risks related to our reputation, which may limit our ability to do business. Responding to these challenges has, at times, increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills, transfer stations and other facilities and expanding existing facilities. In addition, failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills, transfer stations and other facilities, or expanding existing facilities. Our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills, transfer stations and other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills, either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs.\nIf we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nA landfill must be closed and capped, and post-closure maintenance commenced, once the landfill's permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized. Further, we undertake remediation activities at some of our solid waste facilities. We have significant financial obligations relating to capping, closure, post-closure and remediation costs at our existing owned or operated landfills, and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills. We establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping, closure, post-closure and remediation\n22\nobligations. We could underestimate such costs and our financial obligations for capping, closure, post-closure or remediation costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose. Additionally, if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason, the accruals for capping, closure, post-closure and remediation could be required to be accelerated. If our capping, closure, post-closure or remediation costs exceed the amounts accrued, or if such accruals are required to be accelerated, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline.\nMost of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs. Some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes, such as yard waste, at landfills. Further, many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal, such as recycling and composting, while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate. Many of the largest companies in the United States are setting zero-waste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills and some jurisdictions have enacted or are considering waste reduction regulations such as extended producer responsibility, organic diversion and minimum recycled content regulations. Although such actions help to protect our environment and reduce the impact of waste on climate change, they have reduced, and will in the future reduce, the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal. Accordingly, we may not be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to possible decreases in demand for such services. If we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely, this could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business, disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe could incur charges to income, which could be material, if landfill and transfer station site development projects or expansion projects are not completed, or certain other events occur.\nIn accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development, expansion and other projects. If a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired, or a development, expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired, we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale, transfer or otherwise. We also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets, which we must assess for impairment annually, and more frequently in the case of certain triggering events. We may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy, or other events may cause impairments. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe business and assets we operate expose us to safety, operational and other risks, including the risk of personal injury to our employees or third parties.\nThe provision of environmental services, including the operation of our facilities, a substantial fleet of trucks and other waste-related assets, involves risks. These risks include, among others, the risk of truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, improper use of dangerous equipment, the release of hazardous substances, fire and explosion, any of which could result in environmental liability, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption or property damage or destruction. While we carry insurance to cover many contingencies, and seek to minimize our exposure to these risks through maintenance, training and compliance programs, any substantial losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages and other workforce effects, which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 23% of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements. If our union-represented employees engage in strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have experienced interrupted service when our union-represented employees have engaged in strikes and work stoppages in the past, and we would expect the same to occur as a result of any future strikes or work stoppages. Additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future which could result in increased operating costs. If a greater percentage of our workforce becomes union-represented, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs.\n23\nWe may not be able to achieve reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions and our other sustainability goals.\nClimate change and other sustainability matters are embedded in our core value and vision. As part of our strategic long-term plans to address sustainability, we are committed to reducing our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2030 among other sustainability goals. The execution of our plans and achievement of our goals are subject to risks and uncertainties, including our ability to develop, obtain, license or scale the innovations, technologies and modeling and measurement tools that may be necessary to achieve our plans and the availability, cost and benefits of materials and infrastructure associated with our sustainability projects, such as our CNG vehicles, fleet electrification, recycling, circularity of key materials, landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects.\nIn addition, increasing governmental and societal attention to sustainability matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, waste production, water usage, human capital, management and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, create challenges for us. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, and meet the sustainability values, standards and metrics that we set for ourselves, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to costly environmental regulations and flow-control regulations that may affect our operating margins, restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability.\nComplying with laws and regulations governing the collection, treatment, storage, transfer and disposal of material, air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases, water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly. Laws and regulations often require us to, among other things, enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill. We may not be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations. In addition, environmental regulatory changes, including those relating to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (commonly referred to as PFAS) and other chemicals of emerging concern, could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping, closure, post-closure and environmental and remediation activities at our waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes, which could have a negative effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the EPA has indicated it is considering listing certain PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, which if finalized could trigger additional obligations or liabilities under CERCLA or other laws and regulations.\nOur Group 3 operations and facilities also are subject to Canadian environmental laws and regulations, including federal and provincial regulations governing the management of hazardous waste, as well as various treaties, laws and regulations governing the ownership, operation and maintenance of maritime vessels used in the business.\nOur Group 3 operations are also subject to federal statutes regulating the treatment, storage and disposal of certain radioactive materials.\nOur business is and will continue to be affected by state, county, provincial, or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county, provincial, or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities. Such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations, resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other governmental regulations could impose costs on our operations, the magnitude of which is difficult to estimate.\nEfforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress. Our landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane, identified as a greenhouse gas, and our vehicle fleet emits, among other things, carbon dioxide, which also is a greenhouse gas. While passage of comprehensive, federal climate change legislation appears unlikely in the near term, we expect any such legislation, if enacted, to impose costs on our operations, which could be material.\nAbsent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA has taken certain actions administratively under its existing Clean Air Act authority. The EPA is compelled to issue rules by the United States Supreme Court's April 2007\nMassachusetts v. EPA\nruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants for purposes of the Clean Air Act and the EPA's December 2009 finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare. With respect to our light- and heavy-duty vehicle fleet, the EPA has finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards. The EPA and the NHTSA have finalized such regulations applicable to light-duty vehicles through model year 2025. In 2018, the EPA and the NHTSA proposed to revise the light-duty vehicle standards for model years 2021 through 2024 to make them less stringent; final action on the proposal took place in 2020 but has been challenged in court. On August 16, 2016, the EPA and the NHTSA issued additional regulations that would impose more stringent standards for heavy-duty vehicles through model-year 2027. These standards and further federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to\n24\nincrease the fuel efficiency of light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith regard to greenhouse gas emissions from our landfills, on July 14, 2016, the EPA issued amendments to its regulations that require large landfills that commenced construction, reconstruction or modification on or after July 17, 2014 to capture additional landfill gas to reduce emissions of methane and certain non-methane gases, which are recognized as greenhouse gases. In a separate action finalized that same day, the EPA issued updates to its 1996 Emission Guidelines to reduce emissions of landfill gas from existing active landfills. As part of the Biden Administration focus on climate change, the EPA has taken further steps to implement these regulations. These regulations, or an amended version of them that eventually goes into effect, may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls and monitoring systems, with resulting capital or operating costs. The application of these or other greenhouse gas regulations to our landfills could have a material adverse effect on our landfill operations and on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot predict what other actions or regulations the current administration may undertake that would affect our industry.\nWe may incur losses from liabilities that are not covered by our insurance. Changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results.\nWe may incur liabilities or suffer losses arising from our operations or properties that resulted in harm to the environment, property, employees or the general public. We maintain insurance for these liabilities and losses, including high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage. If we were to incur substantial liability or loss in connection with these contingencies, our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability or loss. This could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlso, due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, increased insurance retention levels and increased premiums or unavailability of insurance. As we assume more risk for insurance through higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in our insurance reserves and expense.\nDespite our efforts, we may incur additional liability under environmental laws in excess of amounts presently known and accrued.\nWe are a potentially responsible party at many sites under CERCLA, which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict, joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance. CERCLA liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility (e.g., generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site). Hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under CERCLA and their presence, even in minute amounts, can result in substantial liability.\nNotwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable environmental laws, we may have additional liability under environmental laws in excess of our current reserves because, among other things, hazardous substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills (or in waste collected, transported or disposed of in the past by businesses we have acquired), environmental laws or regulations may change, or there may be adverse environmental conditions that develop or were otherwise previously unknown to us. Environmental liabilities in excess of our current reserves could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\nWe are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings. Many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain. Further, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments, fines or settlements, any of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor example, we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations, or who assert claims alleging nuisance, environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. As a result, we may be required to pay fines or judgments or implement corrective measures, or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked. A significant judgment against us, the loss of a significant permit or license, or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with lawsuits, regulatory, governmental and other legal proceedings. We could underestimate such accruals. Such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income.\n25\nChanges\nto federal renewable fuel policies could affect our financial performance in that sector as a renewable fuel producer and impact our projected future investments.\nWe are engaged in 73 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects. The production of renewable fuel through certain of these projects is incentivized by the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Oil refiners and importers are required through the RFS program to blend specified volumes of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy RINs from renewable fuel producers. RIN prices generally respond to administrative actions, decisions and/or regulations from the EPA, including the issuance of an annual renewable volumetric obligation, as well as fluctuations in supply and demand. Changes in the RFS market, the structure of the RFS program or RIN prices and demand may impact the financial performance of the projects developed to capture and treat gas and could impact or alter our projected future investments.\nRisks Related to Financial Strategy and Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which may limit our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $12 billion in principal value of debt and finance leases outstanding. This amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business, to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases, to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments. Further, our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control. If we do not comply with these covenants, we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital.\nWe may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy.\nOur ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt. The credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future. If we were unable to do so, our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected.\nOur financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, acquire other environmental services businesses, pay dividends, repurchase stock and take other actions to enhance shareholder value. We may not succeed in executing our broad-based pricing initiatives, and we may not generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy, pay cash dividends at our present rate, or increase them, or be able to continue our share repurchase program.\nWeakness in the United States economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental entities, large national accounts, industrial customers and others.\nWeakness in the United States economy, including contractions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, reduces the amount of taxes collected by various governmental entities. We provide services to a number of these entities, including numerous municipalities. These governmental entities may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. In addition, weakness in the economy may cause other customers, including our large national accounts, or industrial or environmental services clients, to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us. This could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nThe liabilities we record based on such estimates and assumptions may not be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include amounts based on management's estimates. Actual results may differ from these amounts. Significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs, accruals for final capping, closure and post-closure costs, valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments and liabilities for environmental remediation, multiemployer pension plans, employee benefit plans, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions, insurance and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition. The liabilities recorded for items such as these may not be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face.\n26\nOur obligation to fund multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute, or our withdrawal from such plans, may have an adverse effect on us.\nWe participate in multiemployer pension plans that generally provide retirement benefits to participants of contributing employers. We do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006 (the PPA) requires under-funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios. Based on the information available to us, we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the PPA. We cannot presently determine the amount of additional funding, if any, we may be required to make to these plans. However, plan assessments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period.\nFurther, under current law, upon the termination of a multiemployer pension plan, or in the event of a withdrawal by us (which we consider from time to time) or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers (each, a Withdrawal Event), we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liabilities. We cannot assure you that there will not be a Withdrawal Event with respect to any of the multiemployer pension plans to which we contribute or that, in the event of such a Withdrawal Event, the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor additional discussion and detail regarding multiemployer pension plans see Note 12,\nEmployee Benefit Plans,\nof the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe costs of providing for pension benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe sponsor a defined benefit pension plan that is funded with trustee assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities. Our costs for providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of plan assets. Our pension expenses and related funding requirements are also subject to various actuarial calculations and assumptions, which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, interest rates and other factors. A significant increase in our pension obligations and funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nWe may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nOur growth strategy places significant demands on our financial, operational and management resources. To continue our growth, we may need to add administrative, managerial and other personnel, and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems. We may not be able to find and train qualified personnel, or do so on a timely basis, or to expand or otherwise modify our operations and systems to the extent, and in the time, required.\nWe may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy.\nOur ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business. The integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management. In addition, competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates. Thus, we cannot assure you that:\n•\ndesirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified;\n•\nwe will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified;\n•\nwe will effectively integrate and manage companies we acquire; or\n•\nany acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings.\nIf any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy, our growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nBusinesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities.\nOur due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities. If we acquire a company with undisclosed liabilities such as environmental, remediation or contractual liabilities, as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities. We try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities by conducting due diligence, by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies, by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification, by obtaining representations and warranties insurance and by acquiring only specified\n27\nassets. However, we may not be able to obtain indemnification or insurance coverage, and such indemnification or insurance coverage obtained may not be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property\nOur strategy includes an increasing dependence on technology in our operations. If any of our key technology fails, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are increasingly dependent on technology. Our information technology systems are critical to our ability to drive profitable growth through differentiation, continue the implementation of standardized processes and deliver a consistent customer experience. One of our three differentiating capabilities is to enable our customers to do business with us through more channels and with better access to information and, accordingly, we have made substantial investment in our e-commerce platform. Problems with the operation of the information or communication technology systems we use could adversely affect, or temporarily disable, all or a portion of our operations. Inabilities and delays in implementing new systems can also affect our ability to realize projected or expected revenue or cost savings. Further, any systems failures could impede our ability to timely collect and report financial results in accordance with applicable laws.\nEmerging technologies, including those that are used to recycle and process waste as an alternative to disposal of waste in landfills, represent risks, as well as opportunities, to our current business model. The costs associated with developing or investing in emerging technologies could require substantial capital and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Delays in the development or implementation of such emerging technologies and difficulties in marketing new products or services based on emerging technologies could have similar negative impacts. Our financial results may suffer if we are not able to develop or license emerging technologies, or if a competitor obtains exclusive rights to an emerging technology that disrupts the current methods used in the environmental services industry.\nA cyber security incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use information technology and operational technology assets, including computer and information networks, in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cyber security risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ personal information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. We also rely on a Payment Card Industry compliant third party to protect our customers’ credit card information. In connection with our strategy to grow through acquisitions and to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cyber security risk. If we fail to assess and identify cyber security risks associated with acquisitions and new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventive measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. Also, the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. This changing regulatory landscape may cause increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase our compliance costs. Any failure to comply with these changing security and privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties, fines, legal challenges and reputational harm. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.\nOther Risks Relevant to Our Business\nPrice increases may not be adequate to offset the effect of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume.\nWe seek to secure price increases necessary to offset increased costs, improve our operating margins and earn an appropriate return on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills. From time to time, our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share. Contractual, general economic or market-specific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index. Particularly in a weak or volatile United States economy, our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the consumer price index. This may continue to be the case even when the United States economy recovers because a recovery in the environmental services industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy. As a result, we may be\n28\nunable to offset increases in costs, improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases. Price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lower-cost competitors.\nThe loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects.\nOur future success depends on the continued contributions of several key employees and officers. The loss of the services of key employees and officers, whether through resignation or other causes, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and growth prospects. In some of our markets, we compete with other similar businesses which may drive labor costs or reduce the amount of available qualified personnel.\nThe introduction of new accounting rules, laws or regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations.\nComplying with new accounting rules, laws or regulations, such as, for example, those related to our asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities, could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations or financial conditions in future periods.\nWeakened or volatile economic conditions have and may continue to harm our industry, business and results of operations.\nOur business is directly affected by changes in local, national, global and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control, including changes in governmental monetary policies, consumer confidence, slowing economic growth, inflation, pandemics, supply chain issues and interest ra\ntes. In 2022, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, the Ukraine-Russia conflict,\nUnited States\n-China relations, monetary policy changes, and the resulting increases in interest rates have negatively impacted the economy, disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. In particular, disruption of the labor market and supply chains related to vehicles, especially trucks and the mechanical and electrical components in order to service them, negatively impacts our ability to provide services. A weak or volatile economy may result in decrea\nses in volumes, which adversely affects our revenues. In addition, we have certain fixed costs (e.g., facility expense associated with long-term leases, depreciation expense and accretion expense), which may be difficult to adjust quickly to match declining volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide. Additionally, a decline in volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover, resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs. Operating in an environment of worsening economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, recovery in the environmental services industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate, or any, improvement in our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows."

    "text": "General Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements. In the normal course of our business, we become involved in legal proceedings. Some may result in fines, penalties or judgments against us, or settlements, which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty, we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs used in the immediately following paragraph, the term\nlegal proceedings\nrefers to litigation and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries, excluding: (1) ordinary course accidents, general commercial liability and workers' compensation claims, which are covered by insurance programs, subject to customary deductibles, and which, together with self-insured employee health care costs, are discussed in Note 7,\nOther Liabilities,\nto our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; and (2) environmental remediation liabilities, which totaled $487.5 million at December 31, 2022 and which are discussed in Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs,\nto our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n.\nWe accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. We have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately $9 million relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of December 31, 2022. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our legal proceedings and, where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we are able to reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur with respect to a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we had used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately $7 million higher than the amount recorded as of December 31, 2022.\nLegal Proceedings over Certain Environmental Matters Involving Governmental Authorities with Possible Sanctions of $1,000,000 or More\nItem 103 of the SEC's Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless we reasonably believe the monetary sanctions will not equal or exceed a threshold which we determine is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to our business or financial condition. We have determined such disclosure threshold to be $1,000,000. We have no matters to disclose in accordance with that requirement."

This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that anticipate results that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor further discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in our Annual Report on\n.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of US Ecology\nOn May 2, 2022, we acquired all outstanding equity of US Ecology in a transaction valued at $2.2 billion. US Ecology is a leading provider of environmental solutions offering treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous and specialty waste. This acquisition expands our existing environmental solutions footprint and expands our platform to provide customers in North America with environmental solutions from collection to disposal, including recycling, solid waste, special waste, hazardous waste, container rental and field services. We financed the transaction using the proceeds of a new $1.0 billion unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan Facility) and borrowings under our existing $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the financial results of US Ecology are included within our Group 3 reportable segment.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. In 2020, certain customers in our small- and large-container businesses began adjusting their service levels, which included a decrease in the frequency of pickups or a temporary pause in service. In addition, we experienced a decline in volumes disposed at certain of our landfills and transfer stations. As service levels decreased, we also experienced a decrease in certain costs of our operations which are variable in nature. This decline in service activity peaked in 2020 and has improved sequentially thereafter, returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2022.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are described in more detail in the Results of Operations discussion in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n2023 Financial Guidance\nIn 2023, we will focus on pricing in excess of cost inflation, driving profitable volume growth, investing in sustainability to improve the environment and drive growth, investing in value-creating acquisitions and advancing technology to improve productivity and increase customer retention. Specific guidance follows:\nRevenue\nWe expect revenue to be in the range of $14.650 billion to $14.800 billion. We expect an increase in average yield of approximately 5.5% and volume growth to be in a range of 0.5% to 1.0%. Average yield on related business revenue is expected to be 6.5%.\n33\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\nThe following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2023 compared to the actual adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP:\nWe believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial effect of certain items. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate effect on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nThe guidance set forth above constitutes forward-looking information and is not a guarantee of future performance. The\nguidance is based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and is subject to significant risk and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those shown above. See Item 1A.\nRisk Factors - Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n.\nOverview\nRepublic is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue. As of December 31, 2022, we operated across the United States and Canada through 353 collection operations, 233 transfer stations, 71 recycling centers, 206 active landfills, 3 treatment, recovery and disposal facilities, 20 treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF), 6 salt water disposal wells and 7 deep injection wells. We are engaged in 73 landfill gas-to-energy and other renewable energy projects and had post-closure responsibility for 128 closed landfills.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 19.6% to $13,511.3 million compared to $11,295.0 million in 2021. This change in revenue is due to increased volume of 2.4%, average yield of 5.2%, acquisitions, net of divestitures of 9.6%, fuel recovery fees of 2.6% and environmental solutions revenue of 0.5%, partially offset by decreased recycling processing and commodity sales of 0.6%. Additionally, revenue decreased 0.1% due to one less workday in 2022 as compared to 2021.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue, costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\n34\nOur pre-tax income was $1,831.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $1,575.1 million in 2021. Our net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. was $1,487.6 million, or $4.69 per diluted share for 2022, compared to $1,290.4 million, or $4.04 per diluted share, for 2021.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we recorded a number of charges, other expenses and benefits that impacted our pre-tax income, tax impact, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (net income – Republic) and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table (in millions, except per share data). Additionally, see our\nResults of Operations\nsection of this\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nfor a discussion of other items that impacted our earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. For comparative purposes, prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n(1) The aggregate impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share totals to less than $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(2) The income tax effect related to our adjustments includes both current and deferred income tax impact and is individually calculated based on the statutory rates applicable to each adjustment.\nWe believe that presenting adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income – Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. We have incurred comparable charges and costs in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definitions of adjusted pre-tax income, adjusted tax impact, adjusted net income – Republic, and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Further information on each of these adjustments is included below.\nRestructuring charges.\nIn 2022 and 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of\n$27.0 million\nand\n$16.6 million\n, respectively, primarily related to the redesign of our general ledger, budgeting and procurement enterprise resource planning systems. These systems were placed into production in 2022, and we do not expect to incur future costs related to the implementation of these systems. We paid $19.8 million and $17.2 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts.\nIn 2023, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $20 million, primarily related to the redesign of our customer billing and asset management software systems. Substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate entities and other segment.\n(Gain) loss on business divestitures and impairments, net.\nDuring 2022, we recorded a net gain on business divestitures and impairments of $6.3 million. During 2021, we recorded a loss of $0.5 million related to business divestitures and asset impairments. Additionally, we recognized an increase in our deferred tax provision of $5.5 million due to a change in our United States operational footprint as a result of certain acquisitions that closed during the period.\nAdjustment to withdrawal liability for multiemployer pension funds.\nDuring 2022, we recorded a net reduction of $1.6 million related to the remeasurement of withdrawal costs liabilities from multiemployer pension plans. As we obtain updated information regarding multiemployer pension funds, the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change, which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs.\nAccelerated vesting of compensation expense for CEO transition.\nIn June 2021, Donald W. Slager retired as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Republic Services, Inc. During 2021, we recognized a charge of $22.0 million primarily related to the accelerated vesting of his compensation awards that were previously scheduled to vest in 2022 and beyond.\n35\nUS Ecology, Inc. acquisition integration and deal costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $77.3 million of acquisition integration and deal costs in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology, which included certain costs to close the acquisition and integrate the business, including stock compensation expense for unvested awards at closing as well as severance and change-in-control payments. The acquisition closed on\nMay 2, 2022\n.\nIn\n2023\n, we expect to incur costs of approximately\n$35 million to integrate the US Ecology business, primarily related to the integration of certain software systems as well as rebranding the business.\nWe expect to be substantially complete with our integration activities by the end of\n2023\n.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue by providing environmental services to our customers, including the collection and processing of recyclable materials, the collection, treatment, consolidation, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and other environmental solutions. Our residential, small-container and large-container collection operations in some markets are based on long-term contracts with municipalities. Certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index. We generally provide small-container and large-container collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our transfer stations and landfills generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. Our recycling centers generate revenue from tipping fees charged to third parties and the sale of recycled commodities. Our revenue from environmental solutions primarily consists of (1) fees we charge for the collection, treatment, transfer and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, (2) field and industrial services, (3) equipment rental, (4) emergency response and standby services, (5) in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics, including at our TSDFs and (6) in-plant services such as high-pressure cleaning, tank cleaning, decontamination, remediation, transportation, spill cleanup and emergency response at refineries, chemical, steel and automotive plants and other governmental, commercial and industrial facilities. Other non-core revenue consists primarily of revenue from National Accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.\n36\nThe following table reflects our revenue by service line for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\nThe following table reflects changes in components of our revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nAverage yield is defined as revenue growth from the change in average price per unit of service, expressed as a percentage. Core price is defined as price increases to our customers and fees, excluding fuel recovery, net of price decreases to retain customers. We also measure changes in average yield and core price as a percentage of related-business revenue, defined as total revenue excluding recycled commodities, fuel recovery fees and environmental solutions revenue to determine the effectiveness of our pricing strategies.\n37\nThe following table reflects average yield and core price as a percentage of related-business revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDuring 2022, we experienced the following changes in our revenue as compared to 2021:\n•\nAverage yield increased revenue by 5.2% due to positive pricing changes in all our collection and disposal lines of business.\n•\nThe fuel recovery fee program, which mitigates our exposure to increases in fuel prices, increased revenue by 2.6%, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices compared to 2021 and an increase in the total revenue subject to the fuel recovery fees.\n•\nVolume increased revenue by 2.4% during 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to volume growth in our landfill and all our collection lines of business, partially offset by a decrease in volume in our transfer line of business. The volume increase in our landfill line of business is primarily attributable to increased special waste, construction and demolition, and solid waste volumes.\n•\nRecycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 0.6% primarily due to a decrease in overall commodity prices as compared to 2021. The average price for recycled commodities, excluding glass and organics for 2022 was $170 per ton compared to $187 per ton for 2021.\nChanging market demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 per ton change in the price of recycled commodities will change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately $10 million.\n•\nDuring 2022, environmental solutions revenue increased by 0.5% primarily due to an increase in volumes, including those driven by an increase in rig counts and drilling activity. This revenue increase excludes the impact from our acquisition of US Ecology.\n•\nAcquisitions, net of divestitures, increased revenue by 9.6%, reflecting the results of our continued growth strategy of acquiring solid waste, recycling and environmental services companies, including US Ecology, that complement and expand our existing business platform.\nCost of Operations\nCost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor costs, which include costs for independent haulers that transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators that provide waste handling services associated with our National Accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel tax credits; disposal fees and taxes, consisting of landfill taxes, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal, remediation charges and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management costs, which include insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations.\n38\nThe following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\nThese cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories presented by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by component to that of other companies and of ours for prior periods.\nOur cost of operations increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 as a result of the following:\n•\nLabor and related benefits increased in aggregate dollars due to higher hourly and salaried wages as a result of annual merit increases and an increase in service levels attributable to economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Acquisition-related growth, including the acquisition of US Ecology, also contributed to the increase in labor and related benefits in aggregate dollars.\n•\nTransfer and disposal costs increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to acquisition-related growth, including the acquisition of US Ecology. Transfer and disposal costs also increased in aggregate dollars as a result of higher collection volumes and an increase in third party disposal rates.\nDuring both 2022 and 2021, approximately 68% of the total solid waste volume we collected was disposed at landfill     sites that we own or operate (internalization).\n•\nMaintenance and repairs expense increa\nsed in aggregate dollars due to an increase in the price of replacement parts as well as\nan increase in service levels attributable to the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n•\nTransportation and subcontract costs increased in 2022\ndue to an increase in third-party transportation fees, partially driven by the higher cost of fuel passed on through higher transportation surcharges, and an increase in subcontract work attributable to a corresponding increase in non-core revenues as compared to\n2021.\nAcquisition-related growth, including the acquisition of US Ecology, also contributed to the increase in transportation and subcontract costs.\n•\nOur fuel costs increased due to an increase in the average diesel fuel cost per gallon. The national average diesel fuel cost per gallon for\n2022 was $4.99 compared to $3.29 for 2021.\nAt current consumption levels, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately $27 million per year. Offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers. At current participation rates, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately $31 million per year.\n•\nDisposal    fees and taxes increased in aggregate dollars in 2022 primarily due to increased royalties and host fees from an increase in volume at certain landfills as compared to 2021.\n•\nLandfill operating costs increased in aggregate dollars during 2022 primarily due to increased leachate treatment, transportation and disposal costs due in part to increased rainfall in select geographic regions, as well as landfill gas and other maintenance costs.\n•\nRisk management expenses increased primarily due to unfavorable actuarial development in our auto liability claims as well as higher premium costs.\n39\n•\nDuring 2022, we\nincurred $0.3 million of acquisition integration and deal costs within cost of operations in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology.\n•\nOther costs of operations increased during 2022 due to increased occupancy and facility related expenses, acquisition-related activity and higher third-party truck and equipment rental expense to support higher volumes.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment\nThe following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased primarily due to assets added through acquisitions.\nLandfill depletion and amortization expense increased due to higher landfill disposal volumes primarily driven by special waste, solid waste and construction and demolition volumes coupled with an increase in our overall average depletion rate.\nAmortization of Other Intangible Assets\nExpenses for amortization of other intangible assets were $53.9 million, or 0.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $33.3 million, or 0.3% of revenue, for 2021. Amortization expense increased due to additional assets acquired as a result of our business acquisitions.\nAmortization of Other Assets\nOur other assets primarily relate to the prepayment of fees and capitalized implementation costs associated with cloud-based hosting arrangements. Expenses for amortization of other assets were $52.1 million, or 0.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $40.5 million, or 0.4% revenue, for 2021.\nAccretion Expense\nAccretion expense was $89.6 million, or 0.7% of revenue, and $82.7 million, or 0.7% of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Accretion expense increased in aggregate dollars due to acquired asset retirement obligations.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems and clerical and administrative departments. Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, legal settlements, marketing, investor and community relations services, directors’ and officers’ insurance, general employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges. Restructuring charges are excluded from selling, general and administrative expenses and are discussed separately.\nThe following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\nThese cost categories may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to those of other companies and of ours for prior periods.\n40\nThe most significant items affecting our selling, general and administrative expenses during 2022 as compared to 2021 are summarized below:\n•\nSalaries and related benefits increased in aggregate dollars primarily due to higher wages, benefits and other payroll related items resulting from annual merit increases, offset, in part, by lower management incentive expenses. Acquisition-related growth, including the acquisition of US Ecology, also contributed to the growth in salaries and related benefits in aggregate dollars.\n•\nProvision for doubtful accounts increased primarily due to an increase in days sales outstanding and acquisition-related activity. As of\nDecember 31, 2022\n, our days sales outstanding were 43.3, or 31.8 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 39.2, or 27.5 days net of deferred revenue, as of December 31, 2021. Excluding our acquisition of US Ecology, our days sales outstanding were 39.1, or 27.3 days net of deferred revenue, as of December 31, 2022.\n•\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, largely due to an increase in advertising and travel costs and acquisition-related growth, including US Ecology.\n•\nIn June 2021,\nDonald W. Slager retired as CEO of Republic Services, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a charge of $22.0 million, related to the accelerated vesting of his compensation awards that were previously scheduled to vest in 2022 and beyond.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $77.0 million of acquisition integration and deal costs within selling, general and administration expense in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology, which included certain costs to close the acquisition and integrate the business, including stock compensation expense for unvested awards at closing as well as severance and change-in-control payments. The acquisition closed on May 2, 2022.\nAdjustment to Withdrawal Liability for Multiemployer Pension Funds\nDuring t\nhe year ended December 31, 2022\n, we recorded a net reduction of $1.6 million related to the remeasurement of withdrawal costs liabilities from multiemployer pension plans. As we obtain updated information regarding multiemployer pension funds, the factors used in deriving our estimated withdrawal liabilities will be subject to change, which may adversely impact our reserves for withdrawal costs.\n(Gain) loss on Business Divestitures and Impairments, Net\nWe strive to have a leading market position in each of the markets we serve, or have a clear path on how we will achieve a leading market position over time. Where we cannot establish a leading market position, or where operations are not generating acceptable returns, we may decide to divest certain assets and reallocate resources to other markets. Business divestitures could result in gains, losses or impairment charges that m\nay be material to our results of operations in a given period.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net gain (loss) on business divestitures and impairments of $6.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2022 and 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of\n$27.0 million\nand\n$16.6 million\n, respectively, primarily related to the redesign of our general ledger, budgeting and procurement enterprise resource planning systems. These systems were placed into production in 2022, and we do not expect to incur future costs related to the implementation of these systems. We paid $19.8 million and $17.2 million during 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts.\nIn 2023, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $20 million primarily related to the implementation of replacement billing and collection software systems. Substantially all of these restructuring charges will be recorded in our corporate entities and other segment.\n41\nInterest Expense\nThe following table provides the components of interest expense, including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and risk insurance liabilities assumed in acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars):\nTotal interest expense for 2022 increased compared to 2021 primarily due to additional outstanding debt to fund the purchase of US Ecology and higher interest rates on our floating rate debt.\nCash paid for interest, excluding net swap settlements for our fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, was $311.5 million and $249.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $3,349.1 million of floating rate debt including floating rate swap contracts. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt, annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $33 million.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes was $343.9 million and $282.8 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our effective tax rate, exclusive of non-controlling interests, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 18.8% and 18.0%, respectively. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $185 million and $300 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDuring 2022, we acquired non-controlling interests in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. We account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investment in loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statements of income. For further discussion regarding our equity method accounting, see Note 3,\nBusiness Acquisitions, Investments and Restructuring Charges\n. Our 2022 tax provision reflects a benefit of approximately $139 million due to the tax credits related to these investments.\nOur 2021 tax provision was reduced by approximately $126 million related to the tax credits from our non-controlling interest in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on financial statement income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases and extends, enhances and creates several tax incentives to promote clean energy. While we continue to evaluate the IRA, at present, outside of the potential for future energy credits, we do not believe it will have a material effect on our\naudited\nconsolidated financial statements.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated tax effect of approximately $77 million available as of December 31, 2022. These state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2023 and 2042. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states. In recognition of this risk, as of December 31, 2022, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately\n$42 million.\nFor additional discussion and detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 11,\nIncome Taxes\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n42\nReportable Segments\nOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through three field groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States and the eastern seaboard of the United States. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating primarily in geographic areas located across the United States and Canada. These groups are presented below as our reportable segments, which each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal. Prior to the third quarter of 2022, our environmental solutions operating segment, now referred to as our Group 3 reportable segment, was aggregated with Corporate entities and other.\nCorporate entities and other include legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources, closed landfills and other administrative functions. National Accounts revenue included in Corporate entities and other represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.\nSummarized financial information regarding our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the case of adjusted EBITDA margin) follows. For totals as well as further detail regarding our reportable segments and the adjustments used to calculate gross Adjusted EBITDA, net Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for each segment, see Note 15,\nSegment Reporting\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSignificant changes in the revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin of our reportable segments for 2022 compared to 2021 are discussed below.\n43\nGroup 1\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 10.4% from 2021 due to an increase in average yield and volume in all lines of business. The increase in landfill volume was attributable to an increase in special waste and construction and demolition volumes, offset in part by a decrease in solid waste volumes. Revenue also increased due to acquisition-related growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 1 increased in aggregate dollars from $1,842.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, or a 32.6% adjusted EBITDA margin, to $2,006.9 million, or a 32.2% adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by an increase in vehicle and equipment rental fees, transportation and subcontract costs\ndriven by increases\nin volume, as well as higher disposal costs due to an increase in third party disposal rates, higher maintenance costs due to inflationary pressures on parts and materials and increased transportation and subcontract costs driven by the increase in volume. The unfavorable impact was partially offset by the increase in revenue attributable to both acquisition activity and the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGroup 2\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 12.2% from 2021 due to an increase in average yield in all lines of business and volume in our landfill and small- and large-container collection lines of business. These increases were partially offset by volume declines in our residential and transfer station lines of business. The increase in landfill volume was attributable to an increase in special waste, solid waste and construction and demolition volumes. Revenue also increased due to acquisition-related growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 2 increased from $1,496.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, or a 27.6% adjusted EBITDA margin, to $1,711.3 million, or a 28.2% adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was favorably impacted by the increase in revenue attributable to the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the effective management of certain operating costs, primarily labor and related benefits, disposal costs and maintenance and repairs. The favorable impact was partially offset by an increase in vehicle and equipment rental fees and transportation and subcontract costs\ndriven by the increases\nin volume.\nGroup 3\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased primarily due to the acquisition of US Ecology, as well as an increase in rig counts and drilling activity.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Group 3 increased from $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, or a 20.0% adjusted EBITDA margin, to $211.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, or an 17.4% adjusted EBITDA margin.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased due to the acquisition of US Ecology.\nLandfill and Environmental Matters\nOur landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post-closure and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment, transportation and disposal costs, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance costs, interim cap maintenance costs and costs associated with applying daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site, including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are capitalized and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed.\nCost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in cost estimates, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information.\n44\nAvailable Airspace\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022\n, we owned or operated 206 active landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 5.0 billion in-place cubic yards. For these landfills, the following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity, as measured in cubic yards of airspace as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe following table reflects changes in capacity and remaining capacity for these landfills, as measured in cubic yards of airspace, as of December 31, 2021\n.\nTotal available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. Engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. See Note 2,\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\nand Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Also see our\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\nsection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 13 of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these 13 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 32 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 58 years. We have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for treatment as probable expansion airspace.\n45\nThe following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2022:\nFinal Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nAs of December 31, 2022, accrued final capping, closure and post-closure costs were $1,786.4 million, of which $75.2 million were current and $1,711.2 million were long-term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRemediation and Other Charges for Landfill Matters\nIt is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor a description of our significant remediation matters, see Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs,\nof the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment in Landfills\nAs of December 31, 2022, we expect to spend an estimated additional $10.7 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non-depletable land, estimated to be $15.6 billion, or $3.11 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units-of-consumption method.\nThe following table reflects our future expected investment as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\n46\nThe following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non-depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDuring 2022 and 2021, our average compaction rate was approximately 2,000 pounds per cubic yard based primarily on a three-year historical moving average.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the year ended December 31, 2022 (in millions of dollars):\n47\nThe following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the year ended December 31, 2021 (in millions of dollars):\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe following is a summary of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and marketable securities balances as of December 31:\nOur restricted cash and marketable securities include, among other things, restricted cash and marketable securities pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts and permits, and relating to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations at our landfills, and restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations and restricted cash related to proceeds from the issuance of tax-exempt bonds that will be used to fund qualifying landfill-related expenditures in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nThe following table summarizes our restricted cash and marketable securities as of December 31:\n48\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Intended Uses of Cash\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our known current- and long-term uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures and leases, (2) acquisitions, (3) dividend payments, (4) repayments to service debt and other long-term obligations, (5) payments for asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities and (6) share repurchases.\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\nWe make investments in property and equipment primarily to allow for growth of our service offerings. These investments are largely concentrated in vehicles and equipment and costs to construct our landfills. We expect to receive between $1.65 billion to $1.67 billion of property and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, in 2023.\nWe lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of business under various lease agreements. The most significant lease obligations are for real property and equipment specific to our industry, including property operated as a landfill or transfer station and operating equipment. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of total future lease payments under operating and finance leases was $335.0 million and $430.3 million, respectively. For additional detail regarding our lease obligations, see Note 10,\nLeases\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAcquisitions\nOur acquisition growth strategy focuses primarily on acquiring privately held recycling and solid waste companies and environmental solutions businesses that complement our existing business platform. We continue to invest in value-enhancing acquisitions in existing markets.\nWe expect to invest at least $500 million in acquisitions in 2023.\nDividend Payments\nIn October 2022\n, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of\n$0.495\nper share. Aggregate cash dividends declared were\n$603.4 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we recorded a quarterly dividend payable of\n$156.4 million\nto shareholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2023, which was paid on January 13, 2023.\nDebt and other long-term obligations\nDebt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and our availability to draw on our credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due.\nWe may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We may also explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable. Early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid. The loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs.\nIn May 2022, we entered into a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of unsecured commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500.0 million outstanding at any one time (the Commercial Paper Cap). In August 2022, the Commercial Paper Cap was increased to $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.0 billion principal value of commercial paper issued and outstanding under the program, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.670% and weighted average maturity of 36 days. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund the amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program until they are re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total principal value of our debt was $11.9 billion, of which $456.0 million is due in 2023.\nWe have several agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under these put-or-pay agreements, we must pay for agreed-upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the facilities.\nOur unconditional purchase commitments have varying expiration dates, with some extending through the remaining life of the respective landfill. Future minimum payments under unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of (1) disposal related agreements, which include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host agreements and take-or-pay and put-or-pay agreements and (2) other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements. As of\n49\nDecember 31, 2022, such purchase commitments, which do not qualify for recognition on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, amount to $745.2 million, of which $133.9 million was short-term.\nFor additional detail regarding our debt and known contractual and other obligation, see Note 9,\nDebt,\nand Note 19,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAsset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Liabilities\nWe have future obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure costs with respect to the landfills we own or operate as set forth in applicable landfill permits. As of December 31, 2022, our future obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure costs totaled $1.8 billion, of which $75.2 million was short-term.\nAdditionally, we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. As of December 31, 2022, our environmental liabilities totaled $487.5 million, of which $57.4 million was short-term.\nFor additional detail regarding our asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities, see Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nShare Repurchases\nIn October 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization effective starting January 1, 2021 and extending through December 31, 2023. Share repurchases under the current program may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. While the Board of Directors has approved the program, the timing of any purchases, the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management, at its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized purchase capacity under our October 2020 repurchase program was $1.5 billion.\nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\nThe major components of changes in cash flows for 2022 and 2021 are discussed in the following paragraphs. The following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions of dollars):\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nThe most significant items affecting the comparison of our operating cash flows for 2022 and 2021 are summarized below.\nChanges in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures, decreased our cash flow from operations by $231.0 million in 2022, compared to a decrease of $94.0 million during the same period in 2021, primarily as a result of the following:\n•\nOur accounts receivable, exclusive of the change in allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, increased $198.8 million during 2022, due to the timing of billings net of collections, compared to a $135.4 million increase in the same period in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, our days sales outstanding were 43.3, or 31.8 days net of deferred revenue, compared to 39.2, or 27.5 days net of deferred revenue, as of December 31, 2021.\n•\nOur prepaid expenses and other assets increased $83.8 million in 2022 compared to a $57.0 million increase in 2021, primarily due to additional SaaS implementation costs incurred related to the redesign of our general ledger, budgeting and procurement enterprise resource planning systems in 2022. Cash paid for income taxes was $185 million and $300 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Income taxes paid in 2022 and 2021 reflected benefits from tax credits from our continuing investments in solar energy.\n•\nOur accounts payable increased $106.4 million during 2022 compared to a $113.8 million increase during 2021, due to the timing of payments.\n50\n•\nCash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations was $64.6 million during 2022 compared to $59.6 million for 2021. The increase in cash paid for capping, closure and post-closure obligations is primarily due to the timing of capping and post-closure payments at certain of our landfill sites.\n•\nCash paid for remediation obligations was $2.4 million lower during 2022 compared to 2021.\nIn addition, cash paid for interest was $311.5 million and $249.4 million, excluding net swap settlements for our fixed to floating interest rate swaps, for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt repayments and share repurchases.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nThe most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in investing activities for 2022 and 2021 are summarized below:\n•\nCapital expenditures during 2022 were $1,454.0 million as compared to $1,316.3 million for 2021.\n•\nProceeds from sales of property and equipment during 2022 were $32.8 million as compared to $19.5 million for 2021.\n•\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we used $3,038.5 million and $1,221.7 million, respectively, for acquisitions and investments, net of cash acquired, including the cash used for the acquisition of US Ecology. During 2022 and 2021, we received $50.6 million and $46.3 million from business divestitures, respectively.\nWe intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities and tax-exempt bonds and other financings.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nThe most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows used in financing activities for 2022 and 2021 are summarized below:\n•\nWe issued no senior notes during 2022. During 2021, we issued $700.0 million of senior notes for cash proceeds, net of discounts and fees, of $692.3 million. Net proceeds of notes payable and long-term debt were $2,164.6 million during 2022, compared to net payments of $150.2 million in 2021. For a more detailed discussion, see the\nFinancial Condition\nsection of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n•\nDuring 2022, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our stock for $203.5 million. During 2021, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock for $252.2 million.\n•\nIn July 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.495 per share. Dividends paid were $592.9 million and $552.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n•\nDuring 2022 and 2021, cash paid for purchase price holdback releases and contingent purchase price related to acquisitions was $9.6 million and $21.3 million, respectively.\nFinancial Condition\nDebt Obligations\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022\n, we had $456.0 million of principal debt maturing within the next 12 months, which includes certain variable rate tax-exempt financing, debentures and finance lease obligations. All of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed either quarterly or semiannually by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, as of\nDecember 31, 2022\n, we had availability under our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. In the event of a failed re-borrowing under our commercial paper program, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund the amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program until they are re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these tax-exempt financings and commercial paper program borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2022\n.\nFor further discussion of the components of our overall debt, see Note 9,\nDebt\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n51\nCredit Facilities\nThe Credit Facility\nIn August 2021, we entered into a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). Borrowings under the Credit Facility mature in August 2026. As permitted by the Credit Facility, we have the right to request two one-year extensions of the maturity date, but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extension. The Credit Facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders.\nAt our option, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a Base Rate, a daily floating London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or a Eurodollar Rate, plus a current applicable margin of 0.910% based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the Credit Facility agreement). On the earliest of (i) the date that all available tenors of United States dollar LIBOR have permanently or indefinitely ceased to be provided or have been announced to be no longer representative, (ii) June 30, 2023 or (iii) the effective date of an election to opt into a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), the LIBOR rate will be replaced by a forward-looking term rate based on SOFR or a daily rate based on SOFR published on such date.\nThe Credit Facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the Credit Facility agreement and the aggregate commitment, regardless of usage. Availability under our Credit Facility totaled $1,402.4 million and $2,633.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. The Credit Facility can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. We may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants.\nWe had $250.0 million and $24.3 million in borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility as of\nDecember 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. We had $347.6 million and $341.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility as of\nDecember 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nUncommitted Credit Facility\nIn January 2022, we entered into a $200.0 million unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facility (the Uncommitted Credit Facility), which replaced the prior $135.0 million uncommitted credit facility. The Uncommitted Credit Facility bears interest at an annual percentage rate to be agreed upon by both parties. Borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facility can be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The agreement governing our Uncommitted Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants. The Uncommitted Credit Facility may be terminated by either party at any time.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021,\nwe had no borrowings outstanding under our Uncommitted Credit Facility.\nFinancial and Other Covenants\nThe Credit Facility requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. To the extent we are not in compliance with these covenants, we cannot pay dividends or repurchase common stock. Compliance with covenants also is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the Credit Facility, and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). Additionally, if we are not in compliance with these covenants, we could not use the availability under our Credit Facility to fund borrowings we currently make under our commercial paper program, if there is a failed reborrowing under that program. The Credit Facility provides that our total debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter. In the case of an \"elevated ratio period\", which may be elected by us if one or more acquisitions during a fiscal quarter involve aggregate consideration in excess of $200.0 million (the Trigger Quarter), the total debt to EBITDA ratio may not exceed 4.25 to 1.00 during the Trigger Quarter and each of the following three fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility also provides that there may not be more than two elevated ratio periods elected during the term of the Credit Facility agreement. During the second quarter of 2022, we exercised the elevated ratio clause in conjunction with our acquisition of US Ecology; as a result, we are subject to a 4.25 to 1.00 total debt to EBITDA ratio through March 31, 2023. We were in compliance with this debt covenant for each quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.12 compared to the 4.25 maximum allowed. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all other covenants unde\nr our Credit Facility\n.\nEBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP measure, is calculated as defined in our Credit Facility agreement. In this context, EBITDA is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to EBITDA used by other companies or used by us for other purposes.\nFailure to comply with the financial and other covenants under the Credit Facility, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the Credit Facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the Credit Facility. This could have an adverse effect on the availability of financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on the Credit Facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt and derivative instruments, including our senior notes, and, therefore, our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity. If such\n52\nacceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under the Credit Facility for relief from the financial covenant or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the Credit Facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturity is accelerated.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn April 29, 2022, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured Term Loan Facility (Term Loan Facility), which will mature on April 29, 2025. The Term Loan Facility bears interest at a base rate or a forward-looking SOFR, plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings. The current weighted average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 is 4.629%.\nOn\nMay 2, 2022\n, we completed the acquisition of US Ecology using proceeds from the Term Loan Facility and borrowings under the Credit Facility. We had $1.0 billion in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2022.\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn May 2022, we entered into a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of unsecured commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the Commercial Paper Cap. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.0 billion principal value of commercial paper issued and outstanding under the program, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.670% and weighted average maturity of 36 days for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund amounts currently borrowed under the commercial paper program until they are re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nSenior Notes and Debentures\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $8,107.8 million of unsecured senior notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2050. Our senior notes and debentures are general unsecured obligations. Interest is payable semi-annually.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Relationships\nOur ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. From time to time, we also have entered into interest rate swap and lock agreements to manage risk associated with interest rates, either to effectively convert specific fixed rate debt to a floating rate (fair value hedges), or to lock interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances (cash flow hedges). We also acquired and novated a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge in connection with our acquisition of US Ecology.\nAdditionally, we amended certain interest rate lock agreements, extending the mandatory maturity date and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges (the Extended Interest Rate Locks). In addition, we entered into offsetting interest rate swaps to offset future exposures to fair value fluctuations of the Extended Interest Rate Locks.\nFor a description of our derivative contracts and hedge accounting, see Note 9,\nDebt\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTax-Exempt Financings\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $1,182.0 million and $1,181.5 million of certain variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2051. There were no tax-exempt financings issued during 2022. During 2021, we issued $205.0 million of tax-exempt financings.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority issued, for our benefit, $30.0 million of Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds. The proceeds from the issuance, after deferred issuance costs, will be used to fund qualifying landfill-related expenditures in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, of which $30.0 million and $17.2 million was incurred and reimbursed to us as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021\n, we had $127.6 million\nand $139.0 million\n, respectively, of restricted cash and marketable securities. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, $12.4 million of the restricted cash and marketable securities balance\nrepresented proceeds from the issuance of the tax-exempt bonds.\nFinance Leases\nWe had finance lease liabilities of $247.5 million and $249.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2063 and 2022 to 2063, respectively.\n53\nCredit Ratings\nOur continued access to the debt capital markets and to new financing facilities, as well as our borrowing costs, depend on multiple factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2022, our credit ratings were BBB+, Baa2 and BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, Inc., respectively. If our credit ratings were downgraded, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, our ability to access the debt markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, our cost of funds and other terms for new debt issuances, could be adversely impacted.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than short-term operating leases and financial assurances, which are not classified as debt. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations. We have not guaranteed any third-party debt.\nSeasonality and Severe Weather\nOur operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction or expansion of our landfills and other facilities. Our operations also can be favorably affected by severe weather, which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our additional services.\nContingencies\nFor a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs\n, Note 11,\nIncome Taxes\nand Note 19,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial Assurance\nWe must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, or insurance policies (Financial Assurance Instruments), or trust deposits, which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states require a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2023, although the mix of Financial Assurance Instruments may change.\nThese Financial Assurance Instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not classified as indebtedness. Because we currently have no liability for the Financial Assurance Instruments, they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets; however, we record capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and insurance liabilities as they are incurred.\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments.\nWe have noted examples of the estimates that are subject to uncertainty in the accounting for these areas below.\n54\nLandfill Accounting\nLandfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section.\nOur landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates:\n•\nLandfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset.\n•\nLandfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post-closure liabilities that result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset.\nWe use life-cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site. In life-cycle accounting, all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post-closure are also capitalized and amortized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers.\nLandfill Development Costs\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net landfill development costs of $4,515.3 million and $3,914.0 million, respectively. Changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in cost estimates, inflation and applicable regulations.\nSite permits.\nTo develop, construct and operate a landfill, we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nChanges in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process. These changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit.\n•\nStudies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions. Conditions could exist that were not identified in the study, which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. Denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset.\n•\nActions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit, which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. As a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of, or abandon, a project, which could result in an asset impairment.\nTechnical landfill design.\nUpon receipt of initial regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared. The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nChanges in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs. These changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards.\n•\nTechnical design requirements, as approved, may need modifications at some future point in time.\n•\nTechnical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate.\nPermitted and probable landfill disposal capacity.\nIncluded in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill. These factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side-slope construction. The disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards. This measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site-specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill.\n55\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nEstimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements.\n•\nThe density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design, climate and the nature of the waste.\n•\nCapacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons. The number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction.\nDevelopment costs.\nThe types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third-party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the changes in year-over-year cost estimates for reasonableness, and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nActual future costs of construction materials and third-party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the level of demand and the availability of the required materials and labor. Technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory changes or legislative changes.\nLandfill development asset amortization.\nTo match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per-ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill’s operating life. The per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill, by the landfill’s estimated remaining disposal capacity. The expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period.\nAmortization rates may be sensitive to the original cost basis of the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. We secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value. Amortization rates are also influenced by site-specific engineering and cost factors.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nChanges in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. An unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment.\nOn at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually. Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually. See our\nResults of Operations\nsection in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization.\nLandfill Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and post-closure. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our asset retirement obligations related to capping, closure and post-closure were $1,786.4 million and $1,507.3 million, respectively. Changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in available airspace, cost estimates, inflation, our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate and applicable regulations.\nObligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post-closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units-of-consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at\n56\nestimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit-adjusted, risk-free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping, closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections.\nLandfill capping.\nAs individual areas within each landfill reach capacity, we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These requirements are detailed in each landfill's technical design, which is reviewed and approved by the regulatory agency issuing the landfill site permit.\nClosure and post-closure.\nClosure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste, but prior to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a post-closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post-closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site, the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post-closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, third-party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap.\nLandfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets.\nEstimates of the total future costs required to cap, close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation, which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index (1.9% in 2022 and 1.7% in 2021).\nThe present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post-closure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a per-ton basis. These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill.\nCapping, closure and post-closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit-adjusted risk-free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (4.2% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2021 ).\nRetirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities. This accretion is charged to operating expenses. Actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made.\nCorresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities. The retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per-ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed. The per-ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset’s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per-ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event. Closure and post-closure per-ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nChanges in legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in capping, closure activities or post-closure monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used, or term of post-closure care, could cause changes in our cost estimates.\n•\nChanges in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow, changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively. This could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense.\n•\nActual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing, causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping, closure and post-closure liabilities.\n•\nChanges in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities.\n•\nChanges in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit-adjusted risk-free rate used to discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities, assets and expense.\n•\nAmortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design, post-closure monitoring requirements, or the inflation or discount rate.\nOn an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post-closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post-closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed\n57\nlandfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed. See our\nResults of Operations\nsection in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion on changes to our landfill depletion and amortization.\nPermitted and probable disposal capacity.\nDisposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit. We classify this disposal capacity as permitted. We also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion. Probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. Our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows:\n•\nWe own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement;\n•\nWe are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources;\n•\nThere are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project, including political impediments;\n•\nProgress is being made on the project;\n•\nThe expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame; and\n•\nWe believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit.\nAfter successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates. Additionally, for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure rates, we include the incremental costs to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nWe may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local, state, provincial, or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated, both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping, closure and post-closure accruals. An unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nWe are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies. We periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. With the exception of those obligations assumed in certain business combinations, environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Environmental obligations assumed in certain business combinations are initially estimated on a discounted basis, and accreted to full value over time through charges to interest expense. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis. These adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known. We perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. See our\nResults of Operations\nsection in this Management's Discussion and\n58\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for discussion on our remediation adjustments. We have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $487.5 million and $454.9 million of environmental liabilities, respectively. Changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in cost estimates, timing of estimated costs and settlements, inflation, our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate and applicable regulations.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nWe cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities. Our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events. Thus, our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified, the financial viability of those parties and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter. The actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any adjustments could be material.\n•\nActual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution.\n•\nAn unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statements of income.\nInsurance Reserves and Related Costs\nOur insurance policies for workers' compensation, commercial general liability, commercial auto liability and environmental liability are high deductible, or retention programs. The deductibles, or retentions, range from $3 million to $10 million. The employee-related health benefits are also subject to a high-deductible insurance policy. Accruals for deductibles or retentions are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our insurance reserves were $502.6 million and $497.4 million, respectively. Changes in these estimates may be sensitive to changes in the frequency, severity and settlement amount of claims.\nThese estimates are subject to uncertainty attributable to:\n•\nIncident rates, including frequency and severity and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would be reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which such adjustment is known.\n•\nRecorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known.\n•\nThe settlement costs to discharge our obligations, including legal and health care costs, could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our insurance reserves to change.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a description of new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2,\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

    "text": "Interest Rate Risk\nOur major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR or, following the termination of LIBOR, SOFR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. The carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change. We have\nhistorically entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt.\n59\nThe table below provides information about certain of our market-sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward-looking statement.\nThe fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining non-cash discounts, premiums and adjustments to fair value totaling $116.7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $3,349.1 million of floating rate debt including floating interest rate swap contracts. If interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points on our variable rate debt, annualized interest expense and net cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $33 million. This analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items, such as new borrowings and the impact on the economy. See Note 9,\nDebt,\nof the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding how we manage interest rate risk.\nFuel Price Risk\nFuel costs represent a significant operating expense. When economically practical, we may enter into new fuel hedges, renew contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk. As of December 31, 2022, we had no fuel hedges in place. While we charge fuel recovery fees to a majority of our customers, we are unable to charge such fees to all customers.\nAt current consumption levels, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel costs by approximately $27 million per year. Offsetting these changes in fuel expense would result in changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers. At current participation rates, we believe a twenty-cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel would change our fuel recovery fee by approximately $31 million per year.\nOur operations also require the use of certain petrochemical-based products (such as liners at our landfills) the cost of which may vary with the price of petrochemicals. An increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products, which would increase our operating and capital costs. We also are susceptible to increases in fuel recovery fees from our vendors.\nOur fuel costs were $631.1 million during 2022, or 4.7% of revenue, compared to $383.0 million, or 3.4% of revenue, during 2021.\nCommodities Price Risk\nWe market recovered materials such as old corrugated containers and old newsprint from our recycling centers. Changes in market supply and demand for recycled commodities causes volatility in commodity prices. In prior periods, we have entered into derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities. As of December 31, 2022, we had no recycling commodity hedges in place.\nAt current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a $10 change in the price of recycled commodities would change both annual revenue and operating income by approximately $10 million.\nRevenue from recycling processing and commodity sales during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $359.3 million and $420.5 million, respectively.\n60\nITEM 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n61\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Republic Services, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Republic Services, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n62\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nPhoenix, Arizona\nFebruary 22, 2023\n63\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Republic Services, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Republic Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Republic Services, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Republic Services, Inc. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Report of Management on Republic Services, Inc.’s Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of US Ecology, which are included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of US Ecology.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Republic Services, Inc.’s Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nPhoenix, Arizona\nFebruary 22, 2023\n64\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\n65\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\n66\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\n67\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\n68\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\n69\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nRepublic Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (also referred to collectively as Republic, the Company, we, us, or our), is one of the largest providers of environmental services in the United States, as measured by revenue. Our senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through\nthree\nfield groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States and the eastern seaboard of the United States. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating in geographic areas located primarily across the United States and Canada. These groups represent our reportable segments, which each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal. Prior to the third quarter of 2022, our environmental solutions operating segment, now referred to as our Group 3 reportable segment, was aggregated with Corporate entities and other.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Republic Services, Inc. and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We account for investments in entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest under the equity method of accounting or, for investments that do not meet the criteria to be accounted for under the equity method, we reflect these investments at their fair value when it is readily determinable. If fair value is not readily determinable, we use an alternative measurement approach. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFor comparative purposes, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All dollar amounts in tabular presentations are in millions, except per share amounts and unless otherwise noted.\n2.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nManagement’s Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or simply cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In preparing our financial statements, the more critical and subjective areas that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for our long-lived assets, including recoverability, landfill development costs and final capping, closure and post-closure costs; our valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets; our liabilities for potential litigation, claims and assessments; our liabilities for environmental remediation, multiemployer pension plans, employee benefit plans, deferred taxes, uncertain tax positions and insurance reserves; and our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition. Each of these items is discussed in more detail elsewhere in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider liquid investments with a maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nWe may have net book credit balances in our primary disbursement accounts at the end of a reporting period. We classify such credit balances as accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets as checks presented for payment to these accounts are not payable by our banks under overdraft arrangements, and, therefore, do not represent short-term borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were net book credit balances of $\n143.5\nmillion and $\n39.0\nmillion, respectively, in our primary disbursement accounts that were classified as accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Such balances may be in excess of FDIC insured limits. To manage the related credit exposure, we continually monitor the credit worthiness of the financial institutions where we have deposits. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which we provide services, as well as the dispersion of our operations across many geographic areas. We provide services to small-container, large-container, municipal and residential and environmental solutions customers primarily in the United States and Canada. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, but generally do not require collateral to support customer receivables. We establish an allowance\n70\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nfor doubtful accounts based on various factors including the credit risk of specific customers, age of receivables outstanding, historical trends, economic conditions and other information.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable represents receivables from customers for environmental services, including collection and processing of recyclable materials, collection, transfer and disposal of solid waste and environmental solutions. Our receivables are recorded when billed or when the related revenue is earned and represent claims against third parties that will be settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer credits, represents their estimated net realizable value.\nWe establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on various factors including the age of receivables outstanding, historical trends, economic conditions and other information. We also review outstanding balances on an account-specific basis based on the credit risk of the customer. We determined that all of our accounts receivable share similar risk characteristics. We monitor our credit exposure on an ongoing basis and assess whether assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, but generally do not require collateral to support customer receivables.\nThe following table reflects the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31:\nRestricted Cash and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2022, we\nhad $\n127.6\nmillion\nof restricted cash and marketable securities of which\n$\n88.5\nmillion\nsupports our insurance programs for workers' compensation, commercial general liability and commercial auto liability. Additionally, we obtain funds through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the purpose of financing qualifying expenditures at our landfills, transfer stations, collection and recycling centers. The funds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authorities at the time of issuance. As the use of these funds is contractually restricted, and we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes, they are classified as restricted cash and marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the normal course of business, we may be required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities in connection with, among other things, municipal residential collection contracts, closure or post-closure of landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance. At several of our landfills, we satisfy financial assurance requirements by depositing cash into restricted trust funds or escrow accounts.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of income.\nWe revise the estimated useful lives of property and equipment acquired through business acquisitions to conform with our policies. We depreciate assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. We assume no salvage value for our depreciable property and equipment.\nThe estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are as follows:\nLandfill development costs also are included in property and equipment. Landfill development costs include direct costs incurred to obtain landfill permits and direct costs incurred to acquire, construct and develop sites, as well as final capping,\n71\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nclosure and post-closure assets. These costs are amortized or depleted based on consumed airspace. All indirect landfill development costs are expensed as incurred.\nFor additional information, see Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs\n.\nCapitalized Interest\nWe capitalize interest on all landfill cell construction and other construction or development projects. Interest is capitalized on qualified assets while they undergo activities to ready them for their intended use. Capitalization of interest ceases once an asset is placed into service or if construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period of time. Our interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average cost of indebtedness.\nInterest capitalized was $\n5.0\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and $\n6.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities, interest rate hedges and other derivatives, long-term debt, contingent consideration arrangements and assets in our defined benefit pension plan. Accounting standards include disclosure requirements around fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels:\n•\nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.\nSee Note 12,\nEmployee Benefit Plans,\nand Note 18,\nFinancial Instruments,\nfor fair value disclosures related to our defined benefit pension plan investments and financial instruments, respectively.\nInvestments Other Than Derivatives\nInvestments other than derivatives primarily include money market funds, common stock, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, United States government and agency securities, municipal and corporate bonds and foreign government bonds. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as money market funds, common stock and certain mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. These investments are included in Level 2 and consist primarily of corporate bonds, foreign government bonds, real estate investment trusts and certain agency securities.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage our risk associated with changing interest rates by creating offsetting market exposures. We use interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates. In prior periods, we entered into multiple agreements designated as cash flow hedges to lock interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuance. In connection with our acquisition of US Ecology, in the second quarter of 2022, we acquired and novated a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge.\nAll derivatives are measured at fair value using standard valuation models with assumptions about prices and other relevant information based on those observed in the underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). These instruments are recognized in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, as appropriate. The estimated fair values of derivatives used to hedge risks fluctuate over time and should be viewed in relation to the underlying hedged transactions.\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, to the extent they are effective, they are included as an adjustment to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the effective portions of derivative instruments are reported in stockholders’ equity as components of other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or is not probable of occurring. When the forecasted transaction occurs or is not probable of occurring, the realized net\n72\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\ngain or loss is then recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings\n.\nLandfill and Environmental Costs\nLife Cycle Accounting\nWe use life-cycle accounting and the units-of-consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all current and future capitalized costs to acquire and construct a site are calculated, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.\nCosts and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. We use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to deplete capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in cost estimates, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include, but are not limited to, changes due to the addition of airspace attributable to probable expansion areas, airspace consumed and changes in engineering estimates.\nProbable Expansion Airspace\nWe classify landfill disposal capacity as either permitted (having received the final permit from the applicable regulatory agency) or as probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, is included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, all of the following criteria must be met:\n•\nWe own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement;\n•\nWe are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources;\n•\nThere are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project, including political impediments;\n•\nProgress is being made on the project;\n•\nThe expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame; and\n•\nWe believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received.\nUpon meeting our expansion criteria, the rates used at each applicable landfill to expense costs to acquire, construct, cap, close and maintain a site during the post-closure period are adjusted to include both the probable expansion airspace and the additional costs to be capitalized or accrued associated with that expansion airspace.\nWe have identified three steps that landfills generally follow to obtain expansion permits. These steps are as follows:\n•\nObtaining approval from local authorities;\n•\nSubmitting a permit application to state authorities; and\n•\nObtaining permit approval from state authorities.\nWe continually monitor our progress toward obtaining permits for each of our sites with probable airspace. If we determine that a landfill expansion area no longer meets our criteria, the probable expansion airspace is removed from the landfill’s total available capacity and the rates used at the landfill to deplete costs to acquire, construct, cap, close and maintain a site during the post-closure period are adjusted accordingly. In addition, any amounts capitalized for the probable expansion airspace are charged to expense in the period in which it is determined that the criteria are no longer met.\nCapitalized Landfill Costs\nCapitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land, permitting, cell construction and environmental structures. Capitalized permitting and cell construction costs are limited to direct costs relating to these activities, including legal, engineering and construction costs associated with excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells and other costs associated with the development of the site. Interest is capitalized on landfill construction projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their intended use. Capitalized landfill costs also include final capping, closure and post-closure assets and are depleted as airspace is consumed using the units-of-consumption method.\nCosts related to acquiring land, excluding the estimated residual value of unpermitted, non-buffer land, and costs related to permitting and cell construction are depleted as airspace is consumed using the units-of-consumption method.\n73\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCapitalized landfill costs also may include an allocation of purchase price paid for landfills. For landfills purchased as part of a group of assets, the purchase price assigned to the landfill is determined based on the estimated fair value of the landfill. If the landfill meets our expansion criteria, the purchase price is further allocated between permitted airspace and expansion airspace based on the respective ratios to total available airspace. Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units-of-consumption method over the total available airspace, including probable expansion airspace, where appropriate.\nFinal Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nFinal capping\nWe have future obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure costs with respect to the landfills we own or operate as set forth in applicable landfill permits. The permit requirements are based on the Subtitle C and Subtitle D regulations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as implemented and applied on a state-by-state basis. We define final capping as activities required to permanently cover a portion of a landfill that has been completely filled with waste. Final capping typically includes installing flexible membrane and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compact soil layers and topsoil and is constructed over an area of the landfill where total airspace capacity has been consumed and waste disposal operations have ceased. These final capping activities occur in phases as needed throughout the operating life of a landfill as specific areas are filled to capacity and the final elevation for that specific area is reached in accordance with the provisions of the operating permit. We consider final capping events to be discrete activities that are recognized as asset retirement obligations separately from other closure and post-closure obligations. As a result, we use a separate rate per ton for recognizing the principal amount of the liability and related asset associated with each capping event. We amortize the asset recorded pursuant to this approach as waste volume related to the capacity covered by the capping event is placed into the landfill based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace.\nClosure and post-closure\nClosure and post-closure activities occur after the entire landfill ceases to accept waste and closes. These activities involve methane gas control, leachate management and groundwater monitoring, surface water monitoring and control and other operational and maintenance activities that occur after the site ceases to accept waste. Obligations associated with monitoring and controlling methane gas migration and emissions are set forth in applicable landfill permits and these requirements are based on the provisions of the Clean Air Act. The post-closure period generally runs for\n30\nyears after final site closure for municipal solid waste landfills and a shorter period for construction and demolition landfills and inert landfills. We recognize asset retirement obligations and the related amortization expense for closure and post-closure (excluding obligations for final capping) using the units-of-consumption method over the total remaining capacity of the landfill, including probable expansion airspace, where appropriate.\nEstimated future expenditures\nEstimates of future expenditures for final capping, closure and post-closure are developed at least annually by engineers. Management reviews these estimates and our operating and accounting personnel use them to adjust the rates used to capitalize and amortize these costs. These estimates involve projections of costs that will be incurred during the remaining life of the landfill for final capping activities, after the landfill ceases operations and during the legally required post-closure monitoring period. As of December 31, 2022, we had\n128\nclosed landfills.\nFair value measurements\nIn general, we engage third parties to perform most of our final capping, closure and post-closure activities. Accordingly, the fair value of these activities is based on quoted and actual prices paid for similar work. We also perform some of our final capping, closure and post-closure activities using internal resources. Where we expect internal resources to be used to fulfill an asset retirement obligation, we add a profit margin to the estimated cost of such services to better reflect their fair value. If we perform these services internally, the added profit margin is recognized as a component of operating income in the period the obligation is settled.\nOur estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today’s dollars. These costs are inflated each year to reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are expected to be paid. We used a\n1.9\n% inflation rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 and a\n1.7\n% inflation rate for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, which is based on the\nten-year\nhistorical moving average increase of the United States Consumer Price Index. These estimated costs are then discounted to their present values using a credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate.\n74\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nChanges in assets retirement obligations\nA liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and is initially measured at fair value. The offset to the liability is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Changes in the liabilities due to revisions to estimated future cash flows are recognized by increasing or decreasing the liabilities with the offsets adjusting the carrying amounts of the related long-lived assets, and may also require immediate adjustments to amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income. Upward revisions in the amount of undiscounted estimated cash flows used to record a liability are discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate in effect at the time of the change. Downward revisions in the amount of undiscounted estimated cash flows used to record a liability are discounted using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate that existed when the original liability was recognized.\nChanges in asset retirement obligations due to the passage of time are measured by recognizing accretion expense in a manner that results in a constant effective interest rate being applied to the average carrying amount of the liability. The effective interest rate used to calculate accretion expense is our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate in effect at the time the liabilities were recorded.\nWe review our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations at least annually. If there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances related to a landfill during the year, we will review our calculations for the landfill as soon as practical after the change has occurred.\nLandfill operating expenses\nCosts associated with daily maintenance activities and environmental compliance during the operating life of the landfill are expensed as incurred. These costs include, among other things, leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and systems maintenance, interim cap maintenance, costs associated with the application of daily cover materials and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nWe are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, timing of expenditures, the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies. We periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. With the exception of those obligations assumed in certain business combinations, environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. Adjustments arising from changes in amounts and timing of estimated costs and settlements may result in increases or decreases in these obligations and are calculated on a discounted basis as they were initially estimated on a discounted basis. These adjustments are charged to operating income when they are known. We perform a comprehensive review of our environmental obligations annually and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. We have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe acquire businesses in the environmental services industry as part of our growth strategy. Businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.\nWe recognize, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition-date fair values. We measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of: (1) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred, the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any) and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over (2) the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If information about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which a business combination occurs, we report provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The measurement or allocation period ends once we receive the information we are seeking; however, this period will generally not exceed one year from the acquisition date. Any material adjustments recognized during the measurement\n75\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nperiod will be reflected retrospectively in the consolidated financial statements of the subsequent period. We recognize third-party transaction related costs as expense currently in the period in which they are incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1st, or when an indicator of impairment exists, at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are our\nthree\nfield groups: Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 (formerly Environmental Solutions).\nWe may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. If, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's goodwill is impaired, then we perform a quantitative test for that reporting unit. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill encompasses calculating a fair value of goodwill and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, impairment is recognized for the difference.\nAs of October 1, 2022, we utilized a qualitative approach and performed an evaluation of circumstances and events impacting our reporting units to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include: (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; (2) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (3) a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold; (4) continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit; (5) a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value; or (6) we conclude that we may not recover a significant asset group within the reporting unit. We determined it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts. No impairment losses were recorded for goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther intangible assets include values assigned to customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names and are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from\n1\nto\n15\nyears.\nAsset Impairments\nWe continually consider whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets (other than goodwill) or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. Long-lived assets include, for example, capitalized landfill costs, other property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets.\nEvents or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the following:\n•\nA significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group;\n•\nA significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition;\n•\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;\n•\nAn accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset;\n•\nA current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group;\n•\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life; or\n•\nAn impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit.\nThere are certain indicators listed above that require judgment and understanding of the environmental services industry when applied to landfill development or expansion. For example, a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace. Therefore, certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the environmental services industry.\nIf indicators of impairment exist, the asset or asset group is reviewed to determine whether its recoverability is impaired. We assess the recoverability of the asset or asset group by comparing its carrying value to an estimate (or estimates) of its undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining life. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group, we measure an impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which such\n76\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nimpairment is identified. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections of future cash flows and remaining useful lives may vary materially from actual results.\nInsurance Reserves\nOur insurance programs for workers' compensation, commercial general and auto liability, environmental and remediation liability and employee-related health care benefits are subject to high deductible insurance policies. Accruals for insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. We consider our past claims experience, including both frequency and settlement amount of claims, in determining these estimates. It is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to fund the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known. In general, our insurance reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis; however, the insurance liabilities we assumed in business combinations are recorded at estimated fair value, and therefore have been discounted to present value based on our estimate of the timing of the related cash flows.\nCosts Associated with Exit Activities\nWe record costs associated with exit activities such as employee termination benefits that represent a one-time benefit when management approves and commits to a plan of termination, and communicates the termination arrangement to the employees, or over the future service period, if any. Other costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs, including facility and employee relocation costs.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. In general, we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability relating to litigation and regulatory matters based on information available to us. Management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. Contingent liabilities recorded in purchase accounting are recorded at their fair values. These fair values may be different from the values we would have otherwise recorded, had the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an acquisition of a business.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nAccumulated other comprehensive income is a component of stockholders’ equity and includes the effective portion of the net changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges, amortization of our interest rate locks, certain adjustments to liabilities associated with our employee defined benefit pension plan liabilities, net of tax, and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generally provide services under contracts with municipalities or individual customers. Municipal and small-container\ncontracts are generally long-term and often have renewal options. Environmental solutions revenue may be billed in advance of the service being performed, such as the treatment or disposal of the waste. Advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue, and revenue is recognized over the period services are provided.\nWe recognize revenue when control is transferred to the customer, generally at the time we provide a service. Revenue is\nmeasured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing a service. We make payments\nto certain of our customers, including payments to our municipal customers or commodity rebates to customers in our recycling business, which reduce the amount of revenue we recognize.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we record deferred income taxes to reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases using enacted tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making these determinations, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax\n77\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nliabilities, tax planning strategies, projected future taxable income and recent financial operating results. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent such evidence can be objectively verified. If we determine that we would be able to realize a deferred income tax asset in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties are included in other accrued liabilities, deferred income taxes and other long-term tax liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe use the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits earned on eligible development expenditures. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year they are earned.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nWe currently have\none\nqualified defined benefit pension plan, the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain current and former employees of Allied in the United States, including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Plan’s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the Plan document. However, the benefits of all current Plan participants are frozen.\nOur pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Plan’s assets have been invested as determined by our Employee Benefits Committee. The Employee Benefits Committee reviews and adjusts the Plan’s asset allocation as deemed necessary.\nThe benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the Plan are determined using annually established assumptions for discount rates, expected rates of return and mortality rates. We determine the discount rate based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the pension plan measurement date. When that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability. In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we evaluate long-term expected and historical actual returns on the Plan assets, giving consideration to the asset mix and the anticipated duration of our Plan obligations. The average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the period benefits are earned. Our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary.\nEquity-Based Compensation Plans\nCompensation expense associated with our restricted share units is recognized ratably over the vesting period, or to the employee's retirement eligible date, if earlier. The fair value of restricted share units is based on the closing market price on the date of the grant.\nCompensation expense associated with our performance shares that vest based on future performance targets is measured using the fair value of our common stock at the grant date for the stock-settled, equity classified awards and the fair value of our common stock at the end of each reporting period for the cash-settled, liability classified awards. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based on an assessment of the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved.\nIncome tax related cash flows resulting from equity-based payments are reported as a component of operating activities.\nShare Repurchases\nShare repurchases under our share repurchase authorization may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at the current market prices. From time-to-time, we return treasury shares acquired through share repurchases to the status of authorized but unissued. Our accounting policy is to deduct the par value from common stock and to reflect any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in capital.\nLeases\nWe lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of business under various lease agreements. The most significant lease obligations are for real property and equipment specific to our industry, including property operated as a landfill or transfer\n78\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nstation and operating equipment. Our leases have varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations that we consider in determining minimum lease payments. Our lease terms include options to renew the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option.\nCertain leases require payments that are variable in nature based on volume measurements, e.g. a fixed rate per ton at our landfills. In addition, certain rental payments are adjusted annually based on changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index. Variable lease payments are recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We generally account for lease components separately from non-lease components.\nLeases are classified as either operating leases or finance leases, as appropriate. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOperating Leases\nMany of our leases are operating leases. Operating lease classification generally can be attributed to either (1) relatively low fixed minimum lease payments (including, for example, real property lease payments that are not fixed and vary based on the volume of material we receive or process), or (2) minimum lease terms that are shorter than the asset's economic useful life. We expect that, in the ordinary course of business, our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by other leases, or replaced with capital expenditures. We recognize rent expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nWe recognize a right-of-use liability and right-of-use asset for leases classified as operating leases in our consolidated balance sheet upon lease commencement. The right-of-use liability represents the present value of the remaining lease payments. An implicit rate is often not readily available for these leases. As such, we use our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment. In addition, we recognize a corresponding right-of-use asset, which represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The right-of-use asset is adjusted for certain favorable or unfavorable leases recognized through acquisition, prepaid or accrued rent, asset impairments and lease incentives, including but not limited to cash incentives, rent abatement or leasehold improvements paid by the lessor.\nFinance Leases\nWe capitalize assets acquired under finance leases at lease commencement and amortize them to depreciation expense over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term on either a straight-line or a units-of-consumption basis, depending on the asset leased. We record the present value of the related lease payments as a debt obligation. Our finance lease liabilities relate primarily to real property, including certain long-term landfill operating agreements that require minimum lease payments with offsetting finance lease assets recorded as part of the landfill development costs.\nRelated Party Transactions\nIt is our policy that transactions with related parties must be on terms that, on the whole, are no less favorable than those that would be available from unaffiliated parties.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Adopted\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n(ASU 2020-04), as extended in ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nDeferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848\n. ASU 2020-04 provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we novated a certain hedging relationship related to one of our interest rate swap agreements by changing the reference rate from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). The amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFor further discussion of the amendment and relevant hedging relationship, refer to Note 9,\nDebt,\nin Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have not modified any other contracts as a result of reference rate reform.\n79\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAccounting Standards Updates Issued but not yet Adopted as of December 31, 2022\nBusiness Combinations\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805):\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n(ASU 2021-08). ASU 2021-08 improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability and the payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. ASU 2021-08 is effective for all entities that enter into a business combination within the applicable scope. The amendments in this update were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. As such, we adopted the standard beginning January 1, 2023. Our adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements.\n3.\nBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nWe acquired various environmental services businesses during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe purchase price paid for these business acquisitions and the allocations of the purchase price follows:\nThe purchase price allocations are preliminary and based on information existing at the acquisition dates. Accordingly, the purchase price allocations are subject to change. Excluding the US Ecology acquisition discussed below, substantially all of the goodwill and intangible assets recorded for these acquisitions are deductible for tax purposes.\n80\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThese acquisitions are not material to the Company's results of operations, individually or in the aggregate. As a result, no pro forma financial information is provided.\nOn May 2, 2022, we acquired all outstanding equity of US Ecology in a transaction valued at $\n2.2\nbillion. US Ecology is a leading provider of environmental solutions offering treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous, non-hazardous and specialty waste. We financed the transaction using the proceeds of a new $\n1.0\nbillion unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan Facility) and borrowings under our existing $\n3.0\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility. For further discussion of the borrowings used to fund the US Ecology acquisition, refer to Note 9,\nDebt,\nin Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preliminary purchase price allocation for the US Ecology acquisition is reflected in the table above and remains subject to revisions as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the valuation date. The preliminary allocation of purchase price, including the value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired, such as property, plant and equipment, landfill development costs and customer relationship intangible assets, as well as certain leases and environmental liabilities assumed, is based on the best estimates of management and is subject to revision based on the final valuations. We do not expect a step-up in the tax basis of the assets recognized in connection with the US Ecology acquisition, and do not expect the goodwill and intangible assets will be deductible for tax purposes.\nIn 2022\n, we incurred $\n77.3\nmillion of acquisition integration and deal costs in connection with the acquisition of US Ecology, which included certain costs to close the acquisition and integrate the business, including stock compensation expense for unvested equity awards at closing as well as severance and change-in-control payments.\nInvestments\nIn July 2022, we acquired a non-controlling equity interest in a joint venture with a landfill gas-to-energy developer to construct\n39\nrenewable natural gas projects across the United States for approximately $\n88\nmillion. We also purchased an approximately $\n38\nmillion interest in a landfill gas-to-energy project and subsequently divested of our interest to the joint venture. The joint venture agreement provides for additional contributions as certain project milestones are achieved over the next\nfour\nto\nfive\nyears. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nIn 2022 and 2021, we acquired non-controlling equity interests in certain limited liability companies that qualified for investment tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. In exchange for our non-controlling interests, we made capital contributions of approximately $\n205\nmillion and $\n175\nmillion, which were recorded to other assets in our December 31, 2022 and 2021 consolidated balance sheets, respectively. During 2022 and 2021, we reduced the carrying value of these investments by approximately\n$\n158\nmillion\nand $\n178\nmillion, respectively, as a result of cash distributions and our share of income and loss pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreements. Additionally, our tax provisions reflect benefits of approximately $\n139\nmillion and $\n126\nmillion for the years end December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the tax credits related to these investments.\nFor further discussion of the income tax benefits, refer to Note 11,\nIncome Taxes,\nin Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRestructuring Charges\nIn 2022 and 2021, we incurred restructuring charges of\n$\n27.0\nmillion\nand\n$\n16.6\nmillion\n, respectively, primarily related to the redesign of our general ledger, budgeting and procurement enterprise resource planning systems. These systems were placed into production in 2022, and we do not expect to incur future costs related to the implementation of these systems. We paid $\n19.8\nmillion and $\n17.2\nmillion during 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to these restructuring efforts.\n81\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n4.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nA summary of property and equipment, net as of December 31 follows:\nDepreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment was $\n1,245.6\nmillion, $\n1,111.7\nmillion and $\n1,015.9\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n5.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nGoodwill\nA summary of the activity and balances in goodwill accounts by reporting segment follows:\nGoodwill by reportable segment as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 reflects the presentation of Group 3 as a reportable segment for all periods presented. Prior to the third quarter of 2022, Group 3 was aggregated with Corporate entities and other.\nAdjustments to acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily related to changes in our valuation of tangible and intangible assets as well as certain landfill leases and environmental liabilities assumed as a result of obtaining new information regarding the acquisitions that closed in 2021. Adjustments to acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to changes in our valuation of customer relationship intangible assets and fixed assets as a result of obtaining new information regarding certain acquisitions that closed in December 2020.\n82\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOther Intangible Assets, Net\nOther intangible assets, net, include values assigned to customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names, and are amortized over periods ranging from\n1\nto\n15\nyears.\nA summary of the activity and balances by intangible asset type follows:\nBased on the amortizable intangible assets recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, amortization expense for each of the next five years is estimated as follows:\n83\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n6.\nOTHER ASSETS\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nA summary of prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31 follows:\nOther Assets\nA summary of other assets as of December 31 follows:\n84\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n7.\nOTHER LIABILITIES\nOther Accrued Liabilities\nA summary of other accrued liabilities as of December 31 follows:\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nA summary of other long-term liabilities as of December 31 follows:\nInsurance Reserves\nOur liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (which include claims for workers’ compensation, commercial general and auto liability and employee-related health care benefits) were $\n502.6\nmillion and $\n497.4\nmillion, respectively, under our risk management program and are included in other accrued liabilities and insurance reserves, net of current portion, in our consolidated balance sheets. While the ultimate amount of claims incurred depends on future developments, we believe the recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims; however, it is possible that these recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in our insurance reserves for the years ended December 31:\n85\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n8.\nLANDFILL AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS\nAs of December 31, 2022, we owned or operated\n206\nactive landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be\n5.0\nbillion in-place cubic yards. Additionally, we have post-closure responsibility for\n128\nclosed landfills.\nAccrued Landfill and Environmental Costs\nA summary of our accrued landfill and environmental liabilities as of December 31 follows:\nFinal Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nThe following table summarizes the activity in our asset retirement obligation liabilities, which includes liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure, for the years ended December 31:\nWe review annually, in the fourth quarter, and update as necessary, our estimates of asset retirement obligation liabilities. As a result, we reduced amortization expense by $\n5.8\nmillion, increased amortization expense by $\n6.9\nmillion, and reduced amortization expense by $\n12.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to changes in estimates and assumptions concerning the anticipated waste flow, cost and timing of future final capping, closure and post-closure activities.\nThe expected future payments for final capping, closure and post-closure as of December 31, 2022 follows:\nThe estimated remaining final capping, closure and post-closure expenditures presented above are not inflated and not discounted and reflect the total estimated future payments for liabilities which include those incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2022 as well as liabilities yet to be incurred over the remaining life of our landfills.\nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities\nWe accrue for remediation costs when they become probable and can be reasonably estimated. There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with remediation of a site. In these cases, we use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the\n86\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\namount that is at the low end of such range. It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the liabilities recorded for remediation to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. If we used the reasonably possible high ends of our ranges, our aggregate potential remediation liability as of December 31, 2022 would be approximately $\n374\nmillion higher than the amounts recorded. Future changes in our estimates of the cost, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in our environmental remediation liabilities for the years ended December 31:\nThe expected undiscounted future payments for remediation costs as of December 31, 2022 follows:\nThe following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters:\nBridgeton Landfill.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022,we paid $\n15.9\nmillion related to management and monitoring of the remediation area for our closed Bridgeton Landfill in Missouri. We continue to work with state and federal regulatory agencies on our remediation efforts. From time to time, this may require us to modify our future operating timeline and procedures, which could result in changes to our expected liability. As of December 31, 2022, the remediation liability recorded for this site was $\n87.2\nmillion, of which approximately $\n15\nmillion\nis e\nxpected to be paid during 2023. We believe the remaining reasonably possible high end of our range would be approximately $\n140\nmillion higher than the amount recorded as of December 31, 2022.\nWest Lake Landfill Superfund Site\n.\nOur subsidiary Bridgeton Landfill, LLC is one of several currently designated Potentially Responsible Parties for the West Lake Landfill Superfund site (West Lake) in Missouri. On September 27, 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Record of Decision Amendment for West Lake that includes a total undiscounted cost estimate of $\n229\nmillion over a\nfour\nto\nfive year\ndesign and construction timeline. On March 11, 2019, the EPA issued special notice letters under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to Bridgeton Landfill, LLC and the other currently designated Potentially Responsible Parties to initiate negotiations to implement the remedy. At this time we are neither able to predict the final design of that remedy, nor estimate how much of the future response costs of the site our subsidiary may agree or be required to pay. During any subsequent administrative proceedings or litigation, our subsidiary will vigorously contest liability for the costs of remediating radiologically-impacted materials generated on behalf of the federal government during the Manhattan Project and delivered to the site by an Atomic Energy Commission licensee and its subcontractor. Currently, we believe we are adequately reserved for our expected remediation liability. However, subsequent events related to remedy design, divisibility, or allocation may require us to modify our expected remediation liability.\n87\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n9.\nDEBT\nThe carrying value of our credit facilities, finance leases and long-term debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is listed in the following table, and is adjusted for the fair value of interest rate swaps, unamortized discounts, deferred issuance costs and the unamortized portion of adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting. Original issue discounts and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting are amortized to interest expense over the term of the applicable instrument using the effective interest method.\n88\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nFuture Maturities of Debt\nAggregate principal maturities of notes payable, finance leases and other long-term debt as of December 31, 2022 follow:\nCredit Facilities\nThe Credit Facility\nIn August 2021, we entered into a $\n3.0\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility). Borrowings under the Credit Facility mature in August 2026. As permitted by the Credit Facility, we have the right to request\ntwo\none-year\nextensions of the maturity date, but none of the lenders are committed to participate in such extensions. The Credit Facility also includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount of up to $\n1.0\nbillion through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders.\nAt our option, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a Base Rate, a daily floating LIBOR, or a Eurodollar Rate, plus a current applicable margin of\n0.910\n% based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the Credit Facility agreement). On the earliest of (i) the date that all available tenors of United States dollar LIBOR have permanently or indefinitely ceased to be provided or have been announced to be no longer representative, (ii) June 30, 2023 or (iii) the effective date of an election to opt into a SOFR rate, the LIBOR rate will be replaced by a forward-looking term rate based on SOFR or a daily rate based on SOFR published on such date.\nThe Credit Facility is subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the Credit Facility agreement and the aggregate commitment, regardless of usage. The Credit Facility can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility agreement requires us to comply with financial and other covenants. We may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants.\nWe had $\n250.0\nmillion and $\n24.3\nmillion outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had $\n347.6\nmillion and $\n341.9\nmillion of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also had $\n998.2\nmillion of outstanding borrowings (net of related discount on issuance) under our commercial paper program as of December 31, 2022. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund the commercial paper program until it is re-borrowed successfully. As a result, availability under our Credit Facility was $\n1,402.4\nmillion and $\n2,633.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nUncommitted Credit Facility\nIn January 2022, we entered into a $\n200.0\nmillion unsecured uncommitted revolving credit facility (the Uncommitted Credit Facility), which replaced the prior $\n135.0\nmillion uncommitted credit facility. The Uncommitted Credit Facility bears interest at an annual percentage rate to be agreed upon by both parties. Borrowings under the Uncommitted Credit Facility can be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The agreement governing our Uncommitted Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants. The Uncommitted Credit Facility may be terminated by either party at any time.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021,\nwe had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under our Uncommitted Credit Facility.\nTerm Loan Credit Agreement\nOn April 29, 2022, we entered into a $\n1.0\nbillion term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility). The Term Loan Facility will mature on April 29, 2025 and bears interest at a base rate or a forward-looking SOFR, plus an applicable margin based on our debt ratings. The weighted average interest rate for the borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was\n4.629\n%. We may prepay, without penalty, all or any part of the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility at any time.\nOn May 2, 2022, we completed the acquisition of US Ecology using proceeds from the Term Loan Facility and borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n89\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn May 2022, we entered into a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of unsecured commercial paper in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $\n500.0\nmillion outstanding at any one time (the Commercial Paper Cap). In August 2022, the Commercial Paper Cap was increased to $\n1.0\nbillion. As of December 31, 2022, we had $\n1.0\nbillion principal value of commercial paper issued and outstanding under the program with a weighted average interest rate of\n4.670\n% and a weighted average maturity of approximately\n36\ndays for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the event of a failed re-borrowing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund amounts currently borrowed under the commercial paper program until they are re-borrowed successfully. Accordingly, we have classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nInterest Rate Swap and Lock Agreements\nOur ability to obtain financing through the capital markets is a key component of our financial strategy. Historically, we have managed risk associated with executing this strategy, particularly as it relates to fluctuations in interest rates, by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. From time to time, we also have entered into interest rate swap and lock agreements to manage risk associated with interest rates, either to effectively convert specific fixed rate debt to a floating rate (fair value hedges), or to lock interest rates in anticipation of future debt issuances (cash flow hedges).\nFair Value Hedges\nDuring the second half of 2013, we entered into various interest rate swap agreements (the 2013 Interest Rate Swaps) relative to our\n4.750\n% fixed rate senior notes due in May 2023 (\n4.750\n% Notes). The goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs and rebalance our debt portfolio's ratio of fixed-to-floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, these swap agreements had a total notional value of $\n300.0\nmillion and mature in May 2023. We pay interest at floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at a fixed rate of\n4.750\n%. In 2013, these transactions were designated as fair value hedges because the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of the\n4.750\n% Notes resulting from changes in interest rates.\nContemporaneously with the $\n250.0\nmillion partial redemption of the\n4.750\n% Notes in November 2020, we dedesignated the proportional share of these swap agreements as fair value hedges. There was no ineffectiveness recognized in the dedesignation of these fair value hedges. Following the dedesignation, the fair value of these free-standing derivatives was determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, these free-standing derivatives were reflected at their fair value of a $\n1.0\nmillion liability and a $\n3.9\nmillion asset, respectively, and are included in other accrued liabilities and other assets, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized losses of $\n5.0\nmillion, $\n4.4\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion, directly in earnings as an adjustment to non-cash interest expense attributable to the change in fair value of the free-standing derivatives, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the 2013 Interest Rate Swaps that were designated as fair value hedges are reflected at their fair value of a $\n1.2\nmillion liability and a $\n4.7\nmillion asset, respectively, and are included in other accrued liabilities and other assets, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent they are effective, the remaining hedged portion of these interest rate swap agreements is included as an adjustment to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe recognized net interest income of $\n2.9\nmillion, $\n7.9\nmillion and $\n5.7\nmillion, respectively, during 2022, 2021 and 2020, related to net swap settlements for these interest rate swap agreements, which is included as an offset to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized gains of $\n2.7\nmillion and $\n5.2\nmillion and a loss of $\n5.7\nmillion, respectively, related to the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate on the fair value of the hedged senior notes. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized offsetting losses of $\n6.0\nmillion and $\n5.2\nmillion and an offsetting gain of $\n7.6\nmillion, respectively, on the related interest rate swaps attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The difference of these fair value changes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was recorded directly in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor further detail regarding the effect of our fair value hedging on interest expense, see Note 18,\nFinancial Instruments\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe have historically entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in anticipation of planned future issuances of senior notes. Upon the expected issuance of senior notes, we terminate the interest rate locks and settle with our counterparties. These transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges. All of our cash flow hedges settled on or before December 31, 2020. The fair value of our interest rate locks is determined\n90\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nusing standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our previously terminated interest rate locks were recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss\nof\n$\n21.4\nmillion and $\n25.8\nmillion, respectively\n, net of tax. The effective portion of the interest rate locks is amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the issued debt using the effective interest method. D\nuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized losses, net of tax of $\n4.4\nmillion, $\n4.6\nmillion and $\n5.8\nmillion, respectively, as a result of this amortization.\nOver the next 12 months, we expect to amortize\n$\n3.9\nmillion,\nnet of tax, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense as a yield adjustment of our senior notes.\nIn connection with our acquisition of US Ecology, in the second quarter of 2022, we acquired and novated a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement (the 2022 Interest Rate Swap) with an initial effective date of March 6, 2020 and an initial notional amount of $\n500\nmillion relative to our Term Loan Facility. The interest rate swap matures in November 2026. The goal was to reduce overall borrowing costs. Under the terms of the acquired agreement, we pay interest at a fixed interest rate of\n0.832\n% and received interest at floating rates based on changes in LIBOR. The interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. In May 2022, following the closing of the acquisition, we amended the reference rate from a floating rate based on LIBOR to a SOFR rate. In accordance with ASU 2020-04, the amendment of the reference rate did not result in dedesignation of the cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and are recognized in interest expense in the period in which the payment is settled.\nThe fair value of our floating-to-fixed interest rate swap is determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). As of December 31, 2022, the 2022 Interest Rate Swap was recorded at its fair value of $\n36.0\nmillion and is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During 2022, we recognized an unrealized gain of $\n8.4\nmillion in accumulated other comprehensive income for the 2022 Interest Rate Swap.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the 2022 Interest Rate Swap was recorded as a component of accumulated other income of $\n5.1\nmillion, net of tax. The effective portion of the Interest Rate Swap is amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the instrument using the effective interest method. During 2022, we recognized a gain, net of tax, of $\n3.3\nmillion as a result of this amortization. Over the next 12 months, we expect to amortize approximately $\n3\nmillion, net of tax, from accumulated other comprehensive income related to this instrument as an offset to interest expense in the period in which payments are settled.\nFor further detail regarding the effect of our cash flow hedging on interest expense, see Note 18,\nFinancial Instruments\n, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDerivative Contracts\nContemporaneously with the issuance of our\n2.300\n% Notes in February 2020, we amended interest rate lock agreements with an aggregate notional value of $\n550.0\nmillion, extending the mandatory maturity date from 2020 to 2030, and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges (2020 Extended Interest Rate Locks). Contemporaneously with the issuance of our\n2.500\n% Notes in August 2019, we amended interest rate lock agreements with an aggregate notional value of $\n375.0\nmillion, extending the mandatory maturity date from 2019 to 2024, and dedesignated them as cash flow hedges (2019 Extended Interest Rate Locks and collectively with the 2020 Extended Interest Rate Locks referred to as the Extended Interest Rate Locks). There was no ineffectiveness recognized in the termination of these cash flow hedges. In addition, we entered into offsetting interest rate swaps to offset future exposures to fair value fluctuations of the Extended Interest Rate Locks (2019 Offsetting Interest Rate Swap and the 2020 Offsetting Interest Rate Swap, or collectively the Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps). The fair value of these free-standing derivatives was determined using standard valuation models with assumptions about interest rates being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy).\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of the Extended Interest Rate Locks were assets of $\n69.8\nmillion and liabilities of $\n49.9\nmillion, respectively, which were included in other assets and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the 2019 Offsetting Interest Rate Swap was a liability of $\n17.8\nmillion and an asset of $\n11.1\nmillion, which were included in other long-term liabilities and other assets, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of the 2020 Offsetting Interest Rate Swap were liabilities of $\n81.9\nmillion and $\n0.8\nmillion, respectively, which were included in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of $\n109.4\nmillion on the change in fair value of the Extended Interest Rate Locks, with an offsetting loss of $\n107.3\nmillion, on the change in fair value of the Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a gain of $\n45.1\nmillion on the change in fair value of the Extended\n91\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nInterest Rate Locks, with an offsetting loss of $\n44.8\nmillion, on the change in fair value of the Offsetting Interest Rate Swaps. The changes in fair value were recorded directly in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nTax-Exempt Financings\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 we had $\n1,182.0\nmillion and $\n1,181.5\nmillion of certain variable rate tax-exempt financings outstanding, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2051. During 2021, we issued $\n205.0\nmillion of tax-exempt financings.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority issued, for our benefit, $\n30.0\nmillion of Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds. The proceeds from the issuance, after deferred issuance costs, will be used to fund qualifying landfill-related expenditures in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, of which $\n30.0\nmillion and $\n17.2\nmillion was incurred and reimbursed to us as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021\n, we had $\n127.6\nmillion\nand $\n139.0\nmillion\n, respectively, of restricted cash and marketable securities. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, $\n12.4\nmillion of the restricted cash and marketable securities balance\nrepresented proceeds from the issuance of the tax-exempt bonds.\nAll of our tax-exempt financings are remarketed either quarterly or semiannually by remarketing agents to effectively maintain a variable yield. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agents at the end of each interest period. If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket our bonds, the remarketing agent can put the bonds to us. In the event of a failed remarketing, we currently have availability under our Credit Facility to fund these bonds until they are remarketed successfully. Accordingly, we classified these borrowings as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nFinance Leases\nWe had finance lease liabilities of $\n247.5\nmillion and $\n249.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2063.\nInterest Paid\nInterest paid, excluding net swap settlements for our fair value hedges, was $\n311.5\nmillion, $\n249.4\nmillion and $\n325.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021 and 2020\n, respectively.\n10.\nLEASES\nA summary of the lease classification on our consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and\n2021 follows:\n92\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nA summary of the lease cost reflected in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and\n2021 follow:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized changes in our operating right-of-use lease liabilities and assets, resulting from the recognition of non-cash lease expense\nof $\n46.2\nmillion\nand $\n35.8\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, maturities for operating and finance lease liabilities were as follows:\nA summary of the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 follows:\nSupplemental cash flow and other non-cash information for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and\n2021 follow:\n93\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n11.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 follow:\nThe reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31 follow:\nDuring 2022, we acquired non-controlling interests in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets that qualified for investment tax credits under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. We account for these investments using the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of income or loss and other reductions in the value of our investment in loss from unconsolidated equity method investments within our consolidated statements of income. For further discussion regarding our equity method accounting, see Note 3,\nBusiness Acquisitions, Investments and Restructuring Charges\n. Our 2022 tax provision reflects a benefit of approximately $\n139\nmillion due to the tax credits related to these investments.\nOur 2021 tax provision was reduced by approximately $\n126\nmillion related to the tax credits from our non-controlling interest in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets.\nOur 2020 tax provision was reduced by approximately $\n12\nmillion from excess tax benefits related to stock compensation, approximately $\n100\nmillion related to the tax credits from our non-controlling interest in limited liability companies established to own solar energy assets, approximately $\n17\nmillion for adjustments to our valuation allowance due to the realizability of certain state loss carryforwards, and approximately $\n8\nmillion due to the realization of additional federal and state benefits as well as adjustments to deferred taxes due to the completion of our 2019 tax returns.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA, among other things, implements a 15% minimum tax on financial statement income of certain large corporations, a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases and extends, enhances and creates several tax incentives to promote clean energy. While we continue to evaluate the IRA, at present, outside of the potential for future energy credits, we do not believe it will have a material effect on our\naudited\nconsolidated financial statements.\nWe made income tax payments (net of refunds) of approximately $\n185\nmillion, $\n300\nmillion and $\n124\nmillion for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Income taxes paid in 2022, 2021 and 2020 reflect benefits from tax credits from our continuing investments in solar energy. For 2022 and 2020 cash taxes paid also reflects benefits from\n100\n%\nbonus depreciation on qualified assets.\n94\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe components of the net deferred income tax asset and liability as of December 31 follow:\nChanges in the deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended December 31 follow:\nWe have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards. We provide a partial valuation allowance due to uncertainty surrounding the future utilization of these carryforwards in the taxing jurisdictions where the loss carryforwards exist. When determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including recent financial results, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent such evidence can be objectively verified. We adjust the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized.\nSubstantially all of our valuation allowance is associated with state loss carryforwards. The realization of our deferred tax asset for state loss carryforwards ultimately depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income in the appropriate state taxing jurisdictions in future periods. We continue to regularly monitor both positive and negative evidence in determining the ongoing need for a valuation allowance.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards with an estimated tax effect of approximately $\n77\nmillion available as of December 31, 2022. These state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various times between 2023 and 2042. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some of our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized due to limitations on these loss carryforwards in certain states. In recognition of this risk, as of December 31, 2022, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately\n$\n42\nmillion.\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States, as well as income tax in multiple state jurisdictions. Our compliance with income tax rules and regulations is periodically audited by tax authorities. These authorities may challenge the positions taken in our tax filings. Thus, to provide for certain potential tax exposures, we maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions for our estimate of the final outcome of the examinations. Our federal statute of limitations is closed for all years prior to 2015. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2015 through 2018. In addition, we are currently under state examination or administrative review in various jurisdictions for tax years 2012 to 2020.\n95\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the activity in our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31:\nIncluded in our gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are $\n96.5\nmillion, $\n93.6\nmillion and $\n93.3\nmillion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits (net of the federal benefit) that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. However, we are unable to estimate the resolution of these matters over the next 12 months.\nWe recognize interest and penalties as incurred within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits previously noted, we recorded interest expense of $\n1.1\nmillion during 2022 and, in total as of December 31, 2022, have recognized a liability for penalties of $\n0.3\nmillion and interest of $\n15.2\nmillion.\nDuring 2021, we recorded interest expense of approximately $\n0.8\nmillion and, in total as of December 31, 2021, had recognized a liability for penalties of $\n0.3\nmillion and interest of $\n13.7\nmillion. During 2020, we accrued interest of $\n0.8\nmillion and, in total as of December 31, 2020, had recognized a liability for penalties of $\n0.3\nmillion and interest of $\n12.6\nmillion.\nWe believe the recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions are adequate. However, a significant assessment against us in excess of the liabilities recorded could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n12.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn October 2020, our Board of Directors amended and restated the Republic Services, Inc. Executive Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan) to remove references to the performance-based compensation exception that was previously permitted but is no longer applicable under Section 162(m) of the Code. The purposes of the 2021 Plan are to promote the success of the Company; to provide designated Executive Officers with an opportunity to receive incentive compensation dependent upon that success; and to attract, retain and motivate such individuals. We currently have\n12.0\nmillion shares of common stock reserved for future grants under the 2021 Plan.\nIn February 2007, our Board of Directors approved the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2007 Plan); in May 2007 our shareholders approved the 2007 Plan. In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved the Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the Amended and Restated 2007 SIP); in May 2011 our shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2007 SIP. In March 2013, our Board of Directors approved the Republic Services, Inc. Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the Republic Amended and Restated 2007 SIP); in May 2013 our shareholders approved the Republic Amended and Restated 2007 SIP (the 2007 Plan, the Amended and Restated 2007 SIP and the Republic Amended and Restated 2007 SIP are collectively referred to as the Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan). No further awards will be made under the Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.\n96\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit (RSU) activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nDuring the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n, we awarded our non-employee directors\n18,689\n,\n26,328\nand\n29,331\nRSUs, respectively, which vested upon issuance.\nDuring the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n, we awarded\n226,108\n,\n312,602\nand\n258,661\nRSUs, respectively, to executives and employees that vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the anniversary date of the original grant or cliff vest after\nthree\nor\nfour years\n.\nDuring the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n, we granted an additional\n13,969\n,\n19,049\nand\n26,907\nRSUs, respectively, as dividend equivalents.\nThe RSUs do not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the right to receive additional RSUs in lieu of dividends.\nCompensation Expense\nThe fair value of RSUs is based on the closing market price on the date of the grant. The compensation expense related to RSUs is amortized ratably over the vesting period, or to the employee's retirement eligible date, if earlier.\nDuring the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n, compensation expense related to RSUs tota\nled $\n22.8\nmillion, $\n32.5\nmillion and $\n26.2\nmillion, respectively. In 2021, we recognized approximately $\n6\nmillion of compensation expense related to\nthe accelerated vesting of RSUs previously granted to Donald W. Slager that were previously scheduled to vest in 2022 and beyond as a result of his retirement as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Republic Services, Inc. in June 2021. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding RSUs was $\n34.4\nmillion, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.6\nyears.\n97\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nPerformance Shares\nThe following table summarizes performance stock unit (PSU) activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nDuring the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we awarded\n79,043\n,\n181,322\nand\n127,278\nPSUs to our executive officers, respectively. These awards are performance-based as the number of shares ultimately earned depends on performance against pre-determined targets for return on invested capital (ROIC), cash flow value creation (CFVC) and total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 index (RTSR). The PSUs are payable\n50\n% in shares of common stock and\n50\n% in cash after the end o\nf a\nthree-year\nperformance period, when our financial performance for the entire performance period is reported, typically in February of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance period, the number of PSUs awarded can range from\n0\n% to\n150\n% of the targeted amount, depending on the performance against the pre-determined targets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we awarded\n66,296\n,\n118,168\nand\n102,994\nPSUs to our\nemployees other than our executive officers, respectively. The PSUs are payable\n100\n% in shares of common stock after the end of a\nthree-year\nperformance period, when our financial performance for the entire performance period is reported, typically in February of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance period, the number of PSUs awarded can range from\n0\n% to\n150\n% of the targeted amount, depending on the performance against the pre-determined targets.\nD\nuring the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we granted an additi\nonal\n11,304\n,\n13,586\nand\n16,760\nPSU\ns, respectively, as dividend equivalents.\nThe PSUs do not carry any voting or dividend rights, except the right to accumulate additional PSUs in lieu of dividends.\nCompensation Expense\nFor the stock-settled portion of the award that vests based on future ROIC and CFVC performance, compensation expense is measured using the fair value of our common stock at the grant date. For the cash-settled portion of the award that vests based on future ROIC and CFVC performance, compensation expense is recorded based on the fair value of our common stock at the end of each reporting period. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. Compensation expense is only recognized for the portion of the award that we expect to vest, which we estimate based on an assessment of the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved.\nFor the stock-settled portion of the award that vests based on RTSR, the grant date fair value is based on a Monte Carlo valuation and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For the cash-settled portion of the award that vests based on RTSR, compensation expense also incorporates the fair value of our PSUs at the end of each reporting period. Compensation expense is recognized for the RTSR portion of the award whether or not the market conditions are achieved.\nD\nuring the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n, compensation expense related to PSUs tot\naled $\n22.1\nmillion, $\n47.1\nmillion\nand $\n17.2\nmillion, respectively. In 2021, we recognized approximately $\n16\nmillion of compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of PSUs previously granted to Mr. Slager that were previously scheduled to vest in 2022 and beyond as a result of his retirement in June 2021. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding PSUs was $\n22.9\nmillion, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately\n1\nyear.\n98\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nWe currently have\none\nqualified defined benefit pension plan, the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain employees in the United States, including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nThe Plan benefits are frozen. Interest credits continue to be earned by participants in the Plan, and participants whose collective bargaining agreements provide for additional benefit accruals under the Plan continue to receive those credits in accordance with the terms of their bargaining agreements. The Plan was converted from a traditional defined benefit plan to a cash balance plan in 1993.\nPrior to the conversion to the cash balance design, benefits payable as a single life annuity under the Plan were based on the participant’s highest\nfive years\nof earnings out of the last\nten years\nof service. Upon conversion to the cash balance plan, the existing accrued benefits were converted to a lump-sum value using the actuarial assumptions in effect at the time. Participants’ cash balance accounts are increased until retirement by certain benefit and interest credits under the terms of their bargaining agreements. Participants may elect early retirement with the attainment of age\n55\nand completion of\nten years\nof credited service at reduced benefits. Participants with\n35\nyears of service may retire at age\n62\nwithout any reduction in benefits.\nOur pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006 (the PPA).\nNo\ncontributions were made in 2022 or 2021.\nWe must separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the Plan as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the Plan assets. The PBO is equal to the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) as the Plan is frozen and the present value of liabilities is not affected by future salary increases. We use a measurement date that coincides with our year end of December 31.\nThe following table presents the ABO and reconciliations of the changes in the PBO, the Plan assets and the accounting funded status of our defined benefit pension plan for the years ended December 31:\nThe amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $\n11.8\nmillion and $\n14.5\nmillion, respectively.\n99\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe components of the net periodic benefit income for the years ended December 31 are summarized below:\nWe determine the discount rate used in the measurement of our obligations based on a model that matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the Plan measurement date. When that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yields on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability. The term of our obligation, based on the expected retirement dates of our workforce, is approximately\nsix years\n.\nIn developing our expected rate of return assumption, we have evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return projections of the Plan assets, which give consideration to the asset mix and the anticipated timing of the Plan outflows. We primarily utilize fixed income investments to minimize the volatility of the difference between the market value of the Plan assets and the present value of the obligation. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of Plan liabilities, Plan funded status and our financial condition. Derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset and liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.\nThe following table summarizes our target asset allocation as of December 31, 2022 and the actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 for our Plan:\nAsset allocations are reviewed and rebalanced periodically based on funded status. For 2023, the investment strategy for Plan assets is to maintain a portfolio designed to achieve our target of an average long-term rate of return of\n5.40\n%. While we believe we can achieve a long-term average return of\n5.40\n%, we cannot be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations. Assets are strategically allocated among fixed income and cash portfolios to achieve a diversification level that reduces fluctuations in investment returns. Asset allocation target ranges and strategies are reviewed periodically with the assistance of an independent external consulting firm.\n100\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nThe Plan assets are measured at fair value. The following table summarizes, by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the investments of the Plan at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nEstimated future benefit payments for the next ten years under the Plan follow:\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately\n23\n% of our workforce was covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), and approximately\n7\n% of our workforce was covered by CBAs that will expire during 2023.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nWe participate in multiemployer pension plans that generally provide retirement benefits to participants of contributing employers. We do not administer these plans. In general, these plans are managed by a board of trustees with the unions appointing certain trustees and other contributing employers of the plan appointing certain members. We generally are not represented on the board of trustees.\nBased on the information available to us, we believe that some of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the Pension Protection Act (PPA). The PPA requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. Until the plan trustees develop the funding improvement plans or rehabilitation plans as required by the PPA, we cannot determine the amount of any additional contribution or other financial obligations that we may be subject to, if any. Accordingly, we cannot presently determine the effect that the PPA may have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFurthermore, under current law regarding multiemployer benefit plans, a plan’s termination, our voluntary withdrawal (which we consider from time to time), or the mass withdrawal from any under-funded multiemployer pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. During the course of operating our business, we may incur withdrawal events regarding certain of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. We accrue for such events when losses become probable and reasonably estimable.\n101\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nRepublic’s participation in individually significant multiemployer pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2022 is outlined in the table below. Only with respect to multiemployer pension plans, we considered contributions in excess of $\n3.5\nmillion in any period disclosed to be individually significant. The most recent PPA zone status available in 2022 and 2021 is for the plans’ year ended September 30, or December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The status is based on information that Republic received from the plans and is certified by the plans’ actuary. Among other factors, plans in the critical red zone are generally less than\n65\n% funded, plans in the endangered yellow zone are less than\n80\n% funded and plans in the safe green zone are at least\n80\n% funded. Plans in the critical and declining zone are classified as critical and projected to be insolvent in the current year or any of the 14 following plan years. The last column lists the expiration dates of the CBAs to which the plans are subject.\nWe are listed in the Form 5500 for Local No. 731, I.B. of T. Pension Fund as providing more than\n5\n% of the total contributions. At the date these financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available for the plan years ended in 2022.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe maintain the Republic Services 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan), which is a defined contribution plan covering all eligible employees. Under the 401(k) Plan, participants may direct us to defer a portion of their compensation to the 401(k) Plan, subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations. We provide for an employer matching contribution equal to\n100\n% of the first\n3.0\n% of eligible compensation and\n50.0\n% of the next\n2.0\n% of eligible compensation contributed by each employee, which is funded in cash. All contributions vest immediately.\nTotal expense recorded for matching 401(k) contributions in\n2022\n, 2021 and 2020 was $\n73.7\nmillion, $\n62.4\nmillion and $\n59.3\nmillion, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nWe provide eligible Republic employees, officers and directors with the opportunity to voluntarily defer base salary, bonus payments, long-term incentive awards and other compensation, as applicable, on a pre-tax basis through the Republic Services, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the DCP). The DCP is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that conforms to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible participants can defer up to\n80\n% of base salary and up to\n100\n% of bonus, long-term compensation and directors’ fees. Under the DCP, some participants also are eligible for matching contributions. The matching contribution under the DCP is equal to the lesser of\n2\n% of the participant’s compensation over established 401(k) limits or\n50\n% of the amount the participant has deferred. The DCP participants have no ownership or security interest in any of the amounts deferred or the measurement funds under the DCP. The right of each participant in the DCP is solely that of a general, unsecured creditor of Republic with respect to his or her own interest under the DCP. Deferred amounts may be subject to forfeiture and are deemed invested among investment funds offered under the DCP, as directed by each participant. Payments of deferred amounts are payable following separation from service or at a date or dates elected by the participant when the deferral is elected. Payments of deferred amounts are made in either a lump sum or in annual installments over a period not exceeding\n15\nyears.\nRepublic invested in corporate-owned life insurance policies to satisfy future obligations under the DCP. These corporate-owned life insurance policies are held in a Rabbi Trust and are recorded at the amount that can be realized under insurance contracts at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. The aggregate cash surrender value of these life insurance policies was $\n100.6\nmillion and $\n133.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is classified in other assets in our consolidated balance\n102\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nsheets. The DCP liability was $\n98.6\nmillion and $\n119.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is classified in other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nRepublic employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan. The plan allows participants to purchase our common stock for\n95\n% of its quoted market price on the last day of each calendar quarter. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, issuances under this plan totaled\n99,680\nshares,\n104,217\nshares and\n116,865\nshares, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, shares reserved for issuance to employees under this plan totaled\n2.5\nmillion and Republic held employee contributions of $\n2.9\nmillion for the purchase of common stock.\n13.\nSHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS\nShare Repurchases\nShare repurchase activity during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions except per share amounts):\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 there were\nno\nrepurchased shares pending settlement.\nIn October 2020, our Board of Directors approved a $\n2.0\nbillion share repurchase authorization effective starting January 1, 2021 and extending through December 31, 2023. Share repurchases under the program may be made through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. While the Board of Directors has approved the program, the timing of any purchases, the prices and the number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management, at its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized purchase capacity under our October 2020 repurchase program was $\n1.5\nbillion. On a quarterly basis, our Board of Directors reviews the intrinsic value of our stock and the parameters around which we repurchase our shares.\nDividends\nIn October 2022, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $\n0.495\nper share. Aggregate cash dividends declared were $\n603.4\nmillion\n, $\n563.0\nmillion and $\n528.8\nmillion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022\n,\n2021\nand 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we recorded a quarterly dividend payable of\n$\n156.4\nmillion\nto shareholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2023\n.\n103\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n14.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares (including vested but unissued RSUs and PSUs) outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the combined weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, which include, where appropriate, the assumed exercise of employee stock options, unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs at the expected attainment levels. We use the treasury stock method in computing diluted earnings per share.\nEarnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022\n,\n2021\nand 2020\nare calculated as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020\nthere were less than\n0.1\nmillion antidilutive securities outstanding.\n104\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n15.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our operations through\nthree\nfield groups, referred to as Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. Group 1 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the western United States. Group 2 is our recycling and solid waste business operating primarily in geographic areas located in the southeastern and mid-western United States and the eastern seaboard of the United States. Group 3 is our environmental solutions business operating in geographic areas located across the United States and Canada. These groups are presented below as our reportable segments, which each provide integrated environmental services, including but not limited to collection, transfer, recycling and disposal. Prior to the third quarter of 2022, our environmental services operating segment, now referred to as our Group 3 reportable segment, was aggregated with Corporate entities and other.\nSummarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020\nfollows:\nIntercompany revenue reflects transactions within and between segments that generally are made on a basis intended to reflect the market value of such services. Capital expenditures for Corporate entities and other primarily include vehicle inventory acquired but not yet assigned to operating locations and facilities.\n105\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nNational Accounts revenue included in Corporate entities and other represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide and regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Corporate functions include legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources, closed landfills and other administrative functions.\nRevenue and overhead costs generated by Corporate entities and other are either specifically assigned or allocated on a rational and consistent basis amongst our reportable segments to calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. This presentation is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker reviews results of operations to make resource allocation decisions.\nNet Adjusted EBITDA reflects the allocation of Gross Adjusted EBITDA from Corporate entities and other to our reportable segments. As presented in the tables below, Adjusted EBITDA reflects certain adjustments for US Ecology deal and integration costs, losses on equity method investments, (gains) losses on business divestitures, restructuring expenses, adjustments to withdrawal liabilities from multi-employer pension funds, accelerated vesting of compensation expense related to the 2021 CEO transition, loss on extinguishment of debt and other related costs and Bridgeton insurance recovery.\nThe following table calculates our EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\nThe following table calculates our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\n106\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n16.\nREVENUE\nOur operations primarily consist of providing environmental services.\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by service line for the years ended December 31 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue):\nOther non-core revenue consists primarily of revenue from National Accounts, which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide or regional contracts in markets outside our operating areas where the associated material handling is subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations.\nEnvironmental solutions revenue includes revenue generated by US Ecology following our acquisition of the business on May 2, 2022.\nThe factors that impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized for each service line may vary based on the nature of the service performed. Generally, we recognize revenue at the time we perform a service. In the event that we bill for services in advance of performance, we recognize deferred revenue for the amount billed and subsequently recognize revenue at the time the service is provided. Depending on the nature of the contract, we may also generate revenue through the collection of fuel recovery fees and environmental fees which are designed to recover our internal costs of providing services to our customers.\nSee Note 15,\nSegment Reporting\n, for additional information regarding revenue by reportable segment.\nRevenue by Service Line\nCollection Services\nOur collection business involves the collection of material for transport to transfer stations, or directly to landfills or recycling centers. Our collection services business includes both recurring and temporary customer relationships. Our standard contract duration is\nthree years\n, although some of our exclusive franchises are for significantly longer periods. The fees received for collection services are based primarily on the market, collection frequency, type of service, type and volume or weight of the material collected, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal.\nIn general, small-container and residential collection fees are billed monthly or quarterly in advance. Substantially all of the deferred revenue recognized as of December 31, 2021 was recognized as revenue during 2022 when the service was performed.\n107\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOur large-container customers are typically billed on a monthly basis based on the nature of the services provided during the period.\nRevenue recognized under these agreements is variable in nature based on the number of residential homes or businesses serviced during the period, the frequency of collection and the volume of material collected. In addition, certain of our contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index which are unknown at contract inception.\nTransfer Services\nRevenue at our transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees. The fees received for transfer services are based primarily on the market, type and volume or weight of the material accepted, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal. In general, fees are billed and revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed. Revenue recognized under these agreements is variable in nature based on the volume and nature of the material accepted at the transfer station.\nLandfill Services\nRevenue at our landfills is primarily generated by charging tipping fees to third parties based on the volume disposed and the nature of the waste. In general, fees are variable in nature and revenue is recognized at the time the waste is disposed at the facility.\nEnvironmental Solutions\nEnvironmental solutions revenue is primarily generated from the fees we charge for the collection, treatment, consolidation, disposal and recycling of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, field and industrial services, equipment rental, emergency response and standby services and in-plant services, such as transportation and logistics, including at our transfer, storage and disposal facilities (TSDF). Activity for this service line varies across markets and reflects the regulatory environment, pricing and disposal alternatives available in any given market. Revenue recognized under these agreements is variable in nature and primarily based on the volume and type of waste accepted or processed during the period. For certain field and industrial services contracts, we have a right to consideration from our customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance completed to date. Therefore, we have applied the practice expedient to recognize revenue in the amount to which we have the right to invoice.\nRecycling Processing and Commodity Sales\nOur recycling centers generate revenue through the processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard (OCC), old newsprint (ONP), aluminum, glass and other materials at market prices. In certain instances, we issue recycling rebates to our municipal or large-container customers, which can be based on the price we receive upon the final sale of recycled commodities, a fixed contractual rate or other measures. We also receive rebates when we dispose of recycled commodities at third-party facilities. The fees received are based primarily on the market, type and volume or weight of the materials sold. In general, fees are billed and revenue is recognized at the time title is transferred. Revenue recognized under these agreements is variable in nature based on the volume and type of materials sold. In addition, the amount of revenue recognized is based on commodity prices at the time of sale, which are unknown at contract inception.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur service obligations of a long-term nature, e.g., certain collection service contracts, are satisfied over time, and we recognize revenue based on the value provided to the customer during the period. The amount billed to the customer is based on variable elements such as the number of residential homes or businesses for which collection services are provided, the volume of material collected, treated, transported and disposed, and the nature of the material accepted. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for these contracts as our right to consideration corresponds directly to the value provided to the customer for services completed to date and all future variable consideration is allocated to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations.\nAdditionally, certain elements of our long-term customer contracts are unknown upon entering into the contract, including the amount that will be billed in accordance with annual price escalation clauses, our fuel recovery fee program and commodity prices. The amount to be billed is often tied to changes in an underlying base index such as a consumer price index or a fuel or commodity index, and revenue can be recognized once the index is established for the period.\n108\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDeferred Contract Costs\nWe incur certain upfront payments to acquire customer contracts which are recognized as other assets in our consolidated balance sheet, and we amortize the asset over the respective contract life. In addition, we recognize sales commissions that represent an incremental cost of the contract as other assets in our consolidated balance sheet, and we amortize the asset over the average life of the customer relationship. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $\n80.2\nmillion and $\n80.6\nmillion, respectively, of deferred contract costs and capitalized sales commissions. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we amortized $\n13.4\nmillion, $\n12.5\nmillion and $\n12.2\nmillion, respectively, of capitalized sales commissions to selling, general and administrative expenses, and $\n5.7\nmillion, $\n6.4\nmillion and $\n6.5\nmillion, respectively, of other deferred contract costs as a reduction of revenue.\n17.\nCHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) BY COMPONENT\nA summary of changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by component, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 follows:\nA summary of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 follows:\n109\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\n18.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe effect of our derivative instruments in fair value and cash flow hedging relationships on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions):\nFair Value Measurements\nIn measuring fair values of assets and liabilities, we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs (Level 1) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs (Level 3). We also use market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate.\nThe carrying value for certain of our financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain other accrued liabilities, approximates fair value because of their short-term nature.\n110\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following:\nTotal Debt\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our total debt was $\n11.8\nbillion and $\n9.6\nbillion, respectively, and the fair value of our total debt was $\n11.1\nbillion and $\n10.3\nbillion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our fixed rate senior notes and debentures is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our remaining notes payable, tax-exempt financings and borrowings under our credit facilities approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are variable. The fair value estimates -are based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 9,\nDebt\n, for further information related to our debt.\nContingent Consideration\nIn 2015, we entered into a waste management contract with the County of Sonoma, California to operate the county's waste management facilities. As of December 31, 2022, the Sonoma contingent consideration represents the fair value of $\n60.2\nmillion payable to the County of Sonoma based on the achievement of future annual tonnage targets through the expected remaining capacity of the landfill. The potential undiscounted amount of all future contingent payments that we could be required to make under the waste management contract is estimated to be between approximately $\n78\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion.\n111\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nDuring 2022, the activity in the contingent consideration liability included accretion, which was offset by concession payments made in the ordinary course of business. There were\nno\nchanges to the estimate of fair value.\n19.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations and have implemented safeguards to respond to regulatory requirements. In the normal course of our business, we become involved in legal proceedings. Some may result in fines, penalties or judgments against us, or settlements, which may impact earnings and cash flows for a particular period. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any legal matter with certainty, we do not believe the outcome of any of our pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs used herein, the term\nlegal proceedings\nrefers to litigation and similar claims against us and our subsidiaries, excluding: (1) ordinary course accidents, general commercial liability and workers' compensation claims, which are covered by insurance programs, subject to customary deductibles, and which, together with insured employee health care costs, are discussed in Note 7,\nOther Liabilities\n; and (2) environmental remediation liabilities, which are discussed in Note 8,\nLandfill and Environmental Costs.\nWe accrue for legal proceedings when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. We have recorded an aggregate accrual of approximately $\n9\nmillion relating to our outstanding legal proceedings as of December 31, 2022. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, we review each of our legal proceedings and, where it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we accrue for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where we can reasonably estimate a range of losses we may incur regarding such a matter, we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate. If we can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we had used the high ends of such ranges, our aggregate potential liability would be approximately $\n7\nmillion higher than the amount recorded as of December 31, 2022.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nWe participate in multiemployer pension plans that generally provide retirement benefits to participants of contributing employers. We do not administer these plans.\nUnder current law regarding multiemployer pension plans, our withdrawal (which we consider from time to time) or the mass withdrawal from any under-funded multiemployer pension plan (each, a Withdrawal Event) could require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liabilities. During the course of operating our business, we incur Withdrawal Events regarding certain of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. We accrue for such events when losses become probable and reasonably estimable.\nUnconditional Purchase Commitments\nRoyalties\nWe have entered into agreements to pay royalties to prior landowners or host communities, based on, among other things, revenue received and waste tonnage disposed at specified landfills. These royalties are generally payable quarterly and amounts incurred, but not paid, are accrued in our consolidated balance sheets. Royalties are accrued as revenue is received or tonnage is disposed of, as applicable, in the landfills.\nDisposal Agreements\nWe have several agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under these put-or-pay agreements, we must pay for agreed-upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the facilities.\n112\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nOur unconditional purchase commitments have varying expiration dates, with some extending through the remaining life of the respective landfill.\nFuture minimum payments under unconditional purchase commitments, consisting primarily of (1) disposal related agreements, which include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host agreements and take-or-pay and put-or-pay agreements, and (2) other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements, as of December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Marketable Securities\nRestricted cash and restricted cash equivalents are included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statements of cash flows.\nBeginning-of-period and end-of-period cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows are reconciled as follows:\nOur restricted cash and marketable securities includes amounts pledged to regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts and permits and relating to our final capping, closure and post-closure obligations at our landfills and restricted cash and marketable securities related to our insurance obligations.\nThe following table summarizes our restricted cash and marketable securities as of December 31:\nWe must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure costs and our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy our financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or trust deposits. The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations, which vary by state. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post-closure costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states will require a third-party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post-closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations.\n113\nREPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)\nWe had the following financial instruments and collateral in place to secure our financial assurances as of December 31:\nWe had $\n347.6\nmillion and $\n341.9\nmillion of letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Surety bonds subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2029.\nThese financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not classified as debt. Because we currently have no liability for this financial assurance, it is not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. However, we have recorded capping, closure and post-closure obligations and insurance reserves as they are incurred.\nWe own a\n19.9\n% interest in a company that, among other activities, issues financial surety bonds to secure capping, closure and post-closure obligations for companies operating in the environmental services industry. We account for this investment using an alternative measurement approach. There have been no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the recoverability of this investment. This investee company and the parent company of the investee had written surety bonds for us relating primarily to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post-closure, of which $\n1,606.0\nmillion were outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Our reimbursement obligations under these bonds are secured by an indemnity agreement with the investee and a surety bond.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than short-term operating leases and financial assurances, which are not classified as debt. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported financial position or results of operations. We have not guaranteed any third-party debt.\nGuarantees\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business that include indemnification clauses. Indemnifications relating to known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on our best estimate of required future payments. Certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent events or occurrences, such as the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation of the tax law and indemnifications made in divestiture agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that relate to our activities prior to the divestiture and that may become known in the future. We do not believe that these contingent obligations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have entered into agreements with property owners to guarantee the value of property that is adjacent to certain of our landfills. These agreements have varying terms. We do not believe that these contingent obligations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOther Matters\nOur business activities are conducted in the context of a developing and changing statutory and regulatory framework. Governmental regulation of the environmental services industry requires us to obtain and retain numerous governmental permits to conduct various aspects of our operations. These permits are subject to revocation, modification or denial. The costs and other capital expenditures that may be required to obtain or retain the applicable permits or comply with applicable regulations could be significant. Any revocation, modification or denial of permits could have a material adverse effect on us."

    "text": "REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON REPUBLIC SERVICES, INC.’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nWe, as members of management of Republic Services, Inc., are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal\n114\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, our internal control systems and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nWe, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, we concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the specified criteria.\nOur internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nBased on an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 identified in connection with that evaluation, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn May 2022, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity of US Ecology. As permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 did not include an assessment of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to this acquisition. We will continue the process of implementing internal controls over financial reporting for this acquired business. US Ecology contributed approximately 6% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022."
