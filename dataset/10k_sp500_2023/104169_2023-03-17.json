    "text": "General\nWalmart Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings.  Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for our customers.  Each week, we serve approximately 240 million customers who visit more than 10,500 stores and numerous eCommerce websites in 20 countries.\nOur strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, and make trust a competitive advantage.  Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time.  By leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\").  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.\nOur operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\") and January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\").  During fiscal 2023, we generated total revenues of $611.3 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $605.9 billion.\nWe maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"WMT.\"\nThe Development of Our Company\nThe businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market.  In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2023, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 19 countries.\nIn 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com.  Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow.  In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores.  To date, we now have over 8,100 pickup and approximately 7,000 delivery locations globally.  In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and eCommerce innovation, which has enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and expand our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives, such as with our acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra, as well as with our majority stake in PhonePe Private Limited (\"PhonePe\"), a digital transaction platform.\nWe are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and marketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2023 to better serve our customers.  Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where customers view Walmart as their primary destination.  In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service offerings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members.  As we execute on our strategy globally, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart Fulfillment Services, providing access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health and Flipkart Health+, and our financial services businesses.  These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our customers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.\n6\nInformation About Our Segments\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.  We also previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures.  Our operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club, which are further described below.  Each segment contributes to the Company's operating results differently.  However, each has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to the exit of certain markets and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Additional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands.  Walmart U.S. had net sales of $420.6 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 69% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $393.2 billion and $370.0 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\").  In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nOmni-channel.\nWalmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as pickup and delivery, in-home delivery, ship-from-store, and digital pharmacy fulfillment options.  As of January 31, 2023, we had more tha\nn 4,600 pickup locations and more than 3,900\nsame-day delivery locations.  Our Walmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited free shipping on eligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, access to Paramount+ streaming service, and mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience.  We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com.  We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores, as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business.  The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2023:\n(1)\nExcludes other small formats.\nMerchandise.\nWalmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:\n•\nGrocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet supplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;\n•\nGeneral merchandise includes:\n◦\nEntertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and books);\n◦\nHardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);\n◦\nApparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and\n◦\nHome (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home furnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).\n•\nHealth and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other clinical services.\nOther categories in the Walmart U.S. business include an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and fulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and newer initiatives such as B2B last mile delivery services via Walmart GoLocal, and a suite of data products for merchants and suppliers via Walmart Luminate.\nAdditional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores and our fintech venture, ONE), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain types of installment lending.\n7\nBrand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S.  We also market lines of merchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: \"Allswell,\" \"Athletic Works,\" \"Eloquii Elements,\" \"Equate,\" \"Free Assembly,\" \"Freshness Guaranteed,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hyper Tough,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"onn.,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Sam's Choice,\" \"Scoop,\" \"Spring Valley,\" \"Time and Tru,\" \"Way to Celebrate\" and \"Wonder Nation.\"  The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Avia,\" \"Love & Sports,\" \"Better Homes & Gardens,\" \"Pioneer Woman\" and \"Sofia Jeans by Sofia Vergara.\"\nPeriodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units.  When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\nOperations.\nWalmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day.  Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, Walmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations.\nWalmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\nCompetition.\nWalmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition.  Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition.  They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses.  In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\nOur ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry.  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.  We employ many strategies and programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry.  These strategies include the following:\n•\nEDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\n•\nEDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\n•\nOmni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance convenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and\n•\nExpanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet expanding needs.\nDistribution.\nWe continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 163 distribution facilities which are located strategically throughout the U.S.  For fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers.  General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise.  We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 34 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more tha\nn 3,900 s\ntores.\n8\nWalmart International Segment\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 19 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2023.  Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia), and our majority-owned subsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Walmart International previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale.  These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, walmart.cn and other sites.  Walmart International had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 17% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $101.0 billion and $121.4 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix.\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates.  We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth.  As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following highlights over the last three years:\n•\nDivested of Walmart Argentina in November 2020.\n•\nDivested of Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021.\n•\nDivested of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.\n•\nBought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited operations in certain countries in Africa in December 2022.\n•\nIncreased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital transaction platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in December 2022.\nOmni-channel.\nWalmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets and our marketplaces such as Flipkart in India.  Our financial services offerings continue to expand with our digital transaction platform anchored in payments at PhonePe in India.  We have expanded our marketplace in Mexico and Canada, which unlocks fulfillment and advertising services, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia continue to drive ecommerce growth.\nGenerally, retail units' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet.  Our wholesale stores' selling areas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet.  As of January 31, 2023, Walmart International had over 2,900 pickup and approximately 2,500 delivery locations.\nMerchandise.\nThe merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items.  Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent's Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands including \"Aurrera,\" \"Lider,\" and \"PhonePe.\"  In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.\nConsistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as advertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, healthcare and financial services.  Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for example, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform that offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and advertising.  In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service allowing customers to enjoy digital connectivity, and in India we launched Flipkart Health+ enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country.  Combined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\nOperations.\nThe hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats operate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences.\n9\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations.\nWalmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\nCompetition.\nWalmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial services.  Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry.  We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach.  Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.  Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition.  Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition.  They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses.  In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\nDistribution.\nWe utilize a total of 188 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico and South Africa.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment.  During fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities.  Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate.  Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and distribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.  We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 100 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,600 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as well as our physical retail stores.\nSam's Club Segment\nSam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.  Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com.  Sam's Club had net sales of $84.3 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 14% of our consolidated fiscal 2023 net sales, and had net sales of $73.6 billion and $63.9 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\nMembership.\nThe following two options are available to members:\nAll memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost.  Plus Members are also eligible for free shipping on the majority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses.  Beginning in fiscal 2023, Sam's Club launched a single loyalty rewards currency called Sam's Cash which merges and replaces existing Cash Rewards for Plus members and Cash Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders.  Members may redeem Sam's Cash on purchases in the club and online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs.  Sam's Cash does not expire and is available for monthly redemption.\nOmni-channel.\nSam's Club provides an omni-channel experience to members, integrating warehouse clubs and eCommerce through such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and delivery-from-club.  Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications.  The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet.\nMerchandise.\nSam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:\n•\nGrocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items;\n•\nFuel, tobacco and other categories;\n10\n•\nHome and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power equipment, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses, and tire and battery centers;\n•\nHealth and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs; and\n•\nTechnology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office supplies, appliances, and third-party gift cards.\nWithin the categories above, the Member's Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member value.\nOperations.\nSam's Club is available to members through warehouse club locations, as well as online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day.  Club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before regular operating hours.  Consistent with its strategy, Sam's Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience.  Curbside Pickup is available at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members.\nSam's Club also offers \"Scan & Go,\" a mobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations.\nSam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.\nCompetition.\nSam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses.  At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members.  Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.\nDistribution.\nWe utilize 29 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items.  During fiscal 2023, the majority of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were shipped directly to Sam's Club locations by suppliers.  Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 13 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.\nSam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport perishable and non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights.  We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights.  Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.  We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\n11\nSuppliers and Supply Chain\nAs a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online.  In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the \"fresh\" category.  Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant quantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-effectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers.  Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws.  Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access for example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions.  For additional information, see the risk factors herein in \"\n\" under the sub-caption \"Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks.\"\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Priorities\nOur ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create competitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, suppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, including by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building capabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our stakeholders rely.\nWe prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in relevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG priorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity.\n•\nOpportunity\n.  Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, and create opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital Management section below), our suppliers and workers in supply chains, and the communities in which we operate. Doing so helps us fulfill our customer mission, strengthens our business and helps people build a better life for themselves and their families.\n•\nSustainability\n. Walmart's sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both people and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts include sourcing responsibly, helping prevent forced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With respect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, protecting and restoring nature, and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set science-based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 under our Project Gigaton™ initiative.\n•\nCommunity\n. Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities\nby operating our business in a way that meets the needs of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by providing safer, healthier and more affordable food and other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion initiatives.\n•\nEthics and Integrity\n.\nAt every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our associates, with our customers, and in the communities we serve\n.\nWe periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and may update those disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHuman Capital Management\nAt Walmart, we're committed to help people save money and live better around the world. This mission is delivered by our associates who make the difference for our millions of customers and members every day.  As of the end of fiscal 2023, we\n12\nemployed approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and approximately 0.5 million associates internationally.  In the U.S., approximately 93% of our associates are hourly and approximately 70% of our associates are full-time.\nWe know the success and progress we've seen this year and throughout our Company's history is because of our associates who work every day to fulfill our mission.  That's why we're focused on providing opportunities for associates to grow and learn.  For some, we are a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, and for others a place where associates can grow their careers across our global omni-channel business. No matter the role or location, we're focused on developing, rewarding, and retaining associates in an ever-changing environment. As customer expectations and technology change the nature of work, we know it's our people – our humanity – that will differentiate us from the competition, so this must be a top priority.\nOur workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: belonging, well-being, growth and digital.\nBelonging\n-\nBuild a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions matter\n.  We are focused on having an inclusive culture where everyone feels they belong.  We publish our diversity representation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion updates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors.  Of the approximately 2.1 million associates employed worldwide, 52% identify as women.  In the U.S., 50% of the approximately 1.6 million associates identify as people of color.\nWe review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices.  We are committed to creating a performance culture where associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they do.\nTo build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety of ways, including but not limited to our annual associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one interactions.  Management reviews the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey.\nWell-being\n-\nFocus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates.\nWe invest in our associates by offering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as company paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building support, maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral and mental health services, and a store discount card or Sam's Club membership.  Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, including wage structure and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available on our corporate website.  Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGrowth\n-\nProvide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with new skills.\nWe are invested in the growth of our associates in support of our business and their success by offering good jobs that lead to great careers and better lives.  We launched the global Walmart Academy to help associates build and grow their careers, creating one of the largest learning ecosystems in the world. The global Walmart Academy offers training for on-the-job retail skills, leadership courses, and well-being training, serving associates through combination of  digital and in-person offerings. The global focus builds on moving much more to a learning in the flow of work approach.\nWe also provide access to educational opportunities for our part-time and full-time frontline eligible associates in the U.S. through our Live Better U program, which provides access to earn a high school diploma or a college degree. Walmart pays 100% of associates' college tuition, books and fees. Our Live Better U program aligns education offerings with Walmart's own areas of growth, providing opportunities for associates to become great at the job they have today and prepare for the job of tomorrow. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly positions.  Our focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and benefits, and career advancement creates a strong associate value proposition and strengthens our workforce.\nDigital\n-\nAccelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results\n.  To deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in digital tools like Me@Walmart, MyClub and Me@Campus to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance. The MyFeedback app was developed to capture real-time associate feedback. Walmart supports associates who are on the U.S. Medical Plan with free virtual visits which include visits for medical doctor urgent care, along with mental health care with psychiatrist and psychologists.\n13\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following chart names the executive officers of the Company as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

    "text": "The risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we may face.\nStrategic Risks\nFailure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.\nThe retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping.  As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could continue to accelerate.\nOur strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our eCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings.  The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various businesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall enterprise strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the related risks discussed in this\n.  With the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an increasing allocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our reputation or our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets.  In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nFurthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses incurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\nIf we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns.  The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment.  Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products.  Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we offer, our market share and the growth of our business.\nWe face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nEach of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, social commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services.  The omni-channel retail landscape is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and the entry of new, well-funded competitors may increase competitive\n15\npressures. In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\nWe compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.\nA failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail and other markets in which we operate, omni-channel innovations and omni-channel ecosystems developed by our competitors or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance.  See \"\n\" above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.\nCertain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation or substantially reducing operations, whether due to bankruptcy, consolidation or other factors. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-channel ecosystems, or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions.  Such business combinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nGeneral economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely affect our financial performance.  Higher interest rates, lower or higher prices of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.\nIn addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, including energy prices, and other economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.\nThe economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.\nThe performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our business.  These arrangements (such as ONE, our fintech joint venture, and our healthcare initiative with UnitedHealth Group) may not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in the absence of such alliance.  In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance, business relationship or in certain of our recently divested markets, could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n16\nOperational Risks\nGlobal or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, could negatively impact our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional pandemics or epidemics are uncertain and difficult to predict.  A pandemic, such as COVID-19, or other epidemic could impact our business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the spread of a virus or other disease (such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions on retailers), our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.  Customer behaviors changed rapidly during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of the virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which may challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand. These factors may result in higher demand for certain products and less demand for others, as well as out-of-stock positions in certain products, along with delays in delivering those products (due to supply chain and transportation issues) and could impact inventory levels in the future.  Other factors and uncertainties may include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we and our suppliers operate; further increased operational costs; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and medical treatments, including for any variants; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the pandemic or epidemic on our business, including consumer behaviors.  These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.\nTo the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, or a future pandemic or epidemic occurs, such events may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation, implementation of strategic initiatives, cybersecurity threats, payment-related risks, technology systems disruption, supply chain disruptions, labor availability and cost, litigation, and regulatory requirements.\nNatural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, global health epidemics or pandemics, catastrophic and other events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons; weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geopolitical tensions or events; regional or global health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (such as COVID-19); and catastrophic and other events, such as war, civil unrest (including theft, looting or vandalism), terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations (such as those that have occurred in our U.S. stores), or the loss of merchandise as a result of shrink or theft in countries in which we operate, in which our suppliers are located, or in other areas of the world (such as in Ukraine where a war currently exists between Ukraine and Russia) could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nSuch events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers, limitations on store or club operating hours, the lack of an adequate work force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, increases in the costs of procuring products as a result of either reduced availability or economic sanctions, increased transportation costs (whether due to fuel prices, fuel supply, or otherwise), the disruption (whether directly or indirectly) of critical infrastructure systems, banking systems, utility services or energy availability to our stores, clubs and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores, clubs and our other facilities.\nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions, drought, or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable.  Certain impacts of physical risk may include: temperature changes that increase the heating and cooling costs at stores, clubs, and distribution or fulfillment centers; extreme weather patterns that affect the production or sourcing of certain commodities; flooding and extreme storms that damage or destroy our buildings and inventory; and heat and extreme weather\n17\nevents that cause long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of the communities in which Walmart operates. Relative to transition risk, certain impacts may include: changes in energy and commodity prices driven by climate-related weather events; prolonged climate-related events affecting macroeconomic conditions with related effects on consumer spending and confidence; stakeholder perception of our engagement in climate-related policies; and new regulatory requirements resulting in higher compliance risk and operational costs.\nWe bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment centers; theft, loss or spoilage of inventory; and business interruption caused by such events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Moreover, our operations in the U.S. comprise a significant portion of our financial and operational performance. Therefore, any of the above matters that uniquely impact or are specifically concentrated in the U.S. could materially adversely affect our financial and operational performance\n.\nRisks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers.  Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance.  We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct.  Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner and in the large volumes we may demand, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the U.S.\nPolitical and economic instability, as well as other impactful events and circumstances in the countries in which our suppliers and their manufacturers are located (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control (such as, for example, the factors that occurred with respect to the availability of supply for baby formula during the prior fiscal year).\nIn addition, U.S. and international trade policies, tariffs and other restrictions on the exportation and importation of goods, trade sanctions imposed between certain countries and entities, the limitation on the exportation or importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.  These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.  We are also subject to reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms.\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products.  Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.  Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such products also expose us to product liability or food safety claims.  As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.  In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions.  Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions, including, but not limited to, intellectual property and products liability laws, apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes or interpretations could expose us to liability, loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position.  In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others.  Although we have marketplace compliance controls and impose contractual terms on sellers to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect certain prohibited items, enforce such terms, or collect sufficient damages for breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and enterprise strategy.\n18\nWe rely extensively on information and financial systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.\nGiven the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems.  Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security incidents and breaches (including through cyberattacks, which may be from cybercriminals or sophisticated state-sponsored threat actors), catastrophic events such as fires, major or extended winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by our associates or contractors, civil or political unrest, or armed hostilities.  Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and our online operations.  Our information systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities.  If our systems are damaged, breached, attacked, interrupted, or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data as well as suffer interruptions in our business operations in the interim.  Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  In addition, we frequently update our information technology hardware, software, processes and systems.  The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken.  If we fail to timely or successfully integrate and update our information systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings or operational benefits anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. For example, during the first quarter of fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, we initiated an upgrade to our existing financial system, including our general ledger and other applications. If we are unable to implement this upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected; our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed; and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online and enable us to deliver products and services do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping.  We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience.  As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and shipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or member at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.  Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world, and we continue to make investments in supply chain automation to support our omni-channel strategy. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment.  Moreover, some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by third-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function as anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology or a faulty implementation, such failure can significantly interfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations. Any disruption or failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly, and secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise and services at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology in a cost-efficient manner could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems used in our acquired eCommerce, technology or other businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks.  Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and misuse customers' or members' information including personal information and/or payment information and related risks discussed in this\n. Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business.  If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers, members or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.\n19\nAny failure to maintain the privacy or security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates, business partners and vendors, whether as a result of cyberattacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, result in fines, penalties, and liability, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nLike most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information and/or payment information about our customers and members, and we also receive and store information concerning our associates and vendors.  In addition, our health and wellness business operations, the Walmart Health locations, and third-party service providers who handle information on our behalf, store and maintain personal health information.  Some of this information is stored digitally in connection with the digital platforms and technologies that we use to conduct and facilitate our various businesses.\nWe utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for digital storage technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions.  Such providers may have access to information we hold about our customers, members, associates, business partners or vendors.  In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent.  Attacks against information systems and devices, whether our own or those of our third-party service providers, create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware, or phishing incidents. We expect to continue to experience such attempted attacks in the future.  Cyberattacks and threat actors can be sponsored by particular countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise. We and the businesses with which we interact have experienced and continue to experience threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, phishing incidents, worms, bot attacks, ransomware or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card and payment information, and cause system failures and disruptions. Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us.  The increased use of remote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Some of our systems and third-party service providers' systems have experienced security incidents or breaches and although they have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.\nAssociate error or malfeasance, faulty password management, social engineering or other vulnerabilities and irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a compromise or breach of our or their information systems.  Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security.\nAny compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or \"HIPAA\"), customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation or other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.\nOur compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk.  Disruptions in our systems caused by security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do business with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks, or utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our operations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party service providers, customers, members, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.\nOur reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines traditional retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, healthcare, and other customer and business services into a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless for customers to interact with us. Security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting\n20\nour operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity.  Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial position and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies.  Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards, mobile payments, and our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may have information security risk implications.  As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.  We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain or detect cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, security incidents, breaches, or other compromises from known malware or ransomware or other threats that may be developed in the future.  In certain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised, which liabilities could be substantial.\nAdditionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech joint venture, we offer various services such as money transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits cards, installment lending, and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, including privacy, authentication and tokenization, global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.\nThe Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, retention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches.  Among other obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under international, federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, government agencies and the media.  Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, sanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation.\nChanges in type or scope of offerings of our health and wellness business or the Walmart Health business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWalmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments across the U.S. and in various of our international markets such as Canada and Mexico. We also provide management services to Walmart Health centers that offer medical, dental, behavioral health and other health services in a number of states, as well as a national telehealth service provider. In addition, Walmart's 10-year collaboration with UnitedHealth Group includes agreements for Walmart Health to provide value-based care to patients in certain areas of the U.S., among other initiatives.\nA large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home delivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party reimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use of third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any\n21\nadditional\nchanges in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of health reform efforts, and other changes to or novel interpretations of existing state or federal laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals.  Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\nWalmart Health clinical operations are also subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for services; changes in our payer mix; changes in the health insurance market generally; our inability to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans; competition for patients from other healthcare providers, including those that offer telehealth services; changes to healthcare provider utilization practices and treatment methodologies; trends toward value-based purchasing and price transparency; overall economic conditions and the ability of patients to pay for services; staffing challenges, including retention of a sufficient number and quality of healthcare professionals; compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations governing the healthcare industry; changes in laws and regulations, including as a result of health reform efforts; and healthcare technology initiatives, including those related to patient data and interoperability; and public health conditions.\nOne or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the type, volume and mix of services we provide, the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered, and the scope and pace of expansion of Walmart Health and related offerings. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally.  Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to effectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-retail businesses, including, for example, technology, health and wellness, and fintech businesses, and invest significant resources in training and motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including senior management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain associates.  If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised, or novel interpretations of existing labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nFinancial Risks\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results.  Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital expenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase programs or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.\n22\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries.  Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period.  In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates.  Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.  When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit.  Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\nDuring fiscal 2023, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 17% of our consolidated net sales.  Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries.  Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.  These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures or nationalization), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition investigations currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary),\nlocal product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, foreign exchange or currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\nThe economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance.  Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S.  Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.  The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries.  We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.  Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance\n23\nprograms and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations.  Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\nChanges in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn fiscal 2023, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 83% of our consolidated net sales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries.  Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international operations as well as our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated.  The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation.  Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles.\nWe are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative interpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years' tax provision. The effect of such changes in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other new tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the Company or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to enforce novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent changes.  For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \"OECD\"), the European Union and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD's Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis and for which many jurisdictions have now committed to an effective enactment date starting January 1, 2024.  The impact of these potential new rules as well as any other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.\nChanges in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws and regulations specific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate\ncould materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our business and financial performance.\nWe operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate and could be materially adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.  In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere our practices and procedures to comply with these laws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges.\nOur health and wellness operations in the U.S. and the operations of the Walmart Health locations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those related to: licensing, reimbursement arrangements, and other requirements and restrictions; registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental and commercial reimbursement (including Medicare and Medicaid); data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data, including obligations and restrictions related to health information (such as those imposed under HIPAA); billing and coding for healthcare services and properly handling overpayments; debt collection; necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral sources and referral recipients and other fraud and abuse issues, such as those addressed by anti-kickback and false claims laws and patient inducement regulations; qualification of healthcare practitioners; quality and standards of medical services and\n24\nequipment; and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare services, including limitations on the corporate practice of medicine in certain states.\nHealth-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations.  For example, in the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and various other regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.  We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal and holding of controlled substances.  The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  In addition, there has been recent heightened governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). Other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations. We may not be able to predict the nature or success of reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to competition and antitrust matters; protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security requirements; trade, consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale, price label accuracy, advertisement, and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as well as our ONE fintech joint venture); anti-money laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, trade, and other sanctions matters; licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data; working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters; and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations outside of the U.S.  In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as consumer financial protections laws and U.S. sanctions.  Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability (including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report.\nMoreover, we are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Connecticut (the Connecticut Data Protection Act), Colorado (the Colorado Privacy Act), Utah (the Utah Privacy Act) and Virginia (the Consumer Data Protection Act), each of which go into effect in 2023, as well as other laws and regulations such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act,  the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), the United Kingdom's General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China's Personal Information Protection Act, and similar legislation in Quebec (An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information, SQ 2021, c 25). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching, continue to evolve, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. These and other privacy and cybersecurity laws may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach.  Residents in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. Laws such as those in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Utah, and Virginia may allow civil penalties for violations, and CCPA and CPRA provide a private right of action for data breaches.  Furthermore, our marketing and customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our business.  Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity, impact our reputation and could require a costly response from and defense by us.\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny as to existing laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities for existing antitrust, competition, and pricing laws, as well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices of\n25\nexisting laws and regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes, including by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our business, operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  The regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these risks.  To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required licenses and certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages.  Failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment.  We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities.  We may also have indemnification obligations for legal commitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.  For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state consumer laws.\nThe Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and also is a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings related to opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, healthcare providers and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters. In addition, in July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart and other parties requesting the recipients show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations that related to a period prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018.  The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a defendant in litigation with the Federal Trade Commission regarding the Company's money transfer agent services and is also cooperating with and responding to subpoenas issued by the U.S Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent.  The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or investigations or any other related actions by governmental entities regarding these matters and can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and whether its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.  We discuss in more detail these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and in\nin the \"Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements,\" which are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n26\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could increase the costs for our shareholders to bring claims, discourage our shareholders from bringing claims, or\nlimit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations. While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum provision will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under, the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nOur reputation may be adversely affected if we are not able to achieve our ESG goals.\nWe strive to deliver shared value through our business and our diverse stakeholders expect us to make significant progress in certain ESG priority issue areas.  From time to time, we announce certain aspirations and goals relevant to our priority ESG issues.  We periodically publish information about our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and update our ESG reporting from time to time.  Achievement of these aspirations and goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our ESG goals or that certain of our customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations might not be satisfied with our goals or our efforts toward achieving those goals.  Certain challenges we face in the achievement of our ESG objectives are also captured within our ESG reporting, which is not incorporated by reference into and does not form any part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A failure or perceived failure to meet our goals could adversely affect public perception of our business, associate morale or customer or shareholder support."

The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of March 3, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $651 million over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery. In addition, there are over 300 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country as of March 3, 2023. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.\nOpioid Settlement Framework:\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against the Company. The settlement will take effect if a sufficient number of political subdivisions also join.\nDOJ Opioid Civil Litigation:\nA civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending.\nOpioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation\n: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. The court held a hearing on that motion on September 26, 2022; a ruling remains pending. The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.\nDerivative Lawsuits:\nAbt v. Alvarez et al.\n, USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21;\nNguyen v. McMillon et al.,\nUSDC, Dist. of DE, 4/16/21:\nOntario Provincial Council of Carpenters' Pension Trust Fund et al. v. Walton et al.,\nDE Court of Chancery, 9/27/21.\n31\nSecurities Class Actions:\nStanton v. Walmart Inc.\net al.\n, USDC, Dist. of DE, 1/20/21 and\nMartin v. Walmart Inc. et al.,\nUSDC\n,\nDist. of DE, 3/5/21, consolidated into\nIn re Walmart Inc. Securities Litigation\n, USDC, Dist. of DE, 5/11/21.\nASDA Equal Value Claims:\nMs S Brierley & Others v. ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others – Manchester Employment Tribunal); Abbas & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003243); and Abusubih & Others v Asda Stores limited (KB-2022-003240).\nMoney Transfer Agent Services Litigation:\nFederal Trade Commission v. Walmart Inc. (CV-3372), USDC, N. Dist. Of Ill, 6/28/22.\nII. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS:\nForeign Direct Investment Matters:\nIn July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (\"Flipkart\"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the \"Rules\") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements.\nIII. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:\nItem 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million.\nIn December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements."

    "text": "Overview\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\") and January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes.  We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year.  Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales.  We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business.  Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent.  Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.  Comparable sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars.  We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.  Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.\nWe have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio, primarily in the Walmart International segment, including the following highlights over the last three years:\n•\nIn November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.0 billion, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses.  Refer to\n.\n•\nIn February 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction. Refer to\nand\n.\n•\nIn March 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an estimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing of the transaction.  Refer to\n.\n•\nIn November 2022, we completed the buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary (Refer to\n) and in December 2022, we exited operations in certain countries in Africa.\n•\nIn December 2022, we increased our ownership in PhonePe as part of the separation from our majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary.  Refer to\n.\nWe operate in a highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve.  We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce, health and wellness, financial services, advertising, and data service businesses.  Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce\n35\npresence.  We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality associates.  We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain, inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, inflation, deflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.  Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its securities can be found herein under \"\n.\"\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low\ncosts. However, like other retail companies, we have seen supply chain disruptions contributing to higher than\nnormal inventory levels throughout the year. In addition, our merchandise costs for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 have been impacted by high inflation, greater than what we have experienced in recent years. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.\nWe expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation; swings in macroeconomic conditions and their effect on consumer confidence; volatility in employment trends; supply chain pressures; and ongoing uncertainties related to global health epidemics or pandemics, any of which may impact our results.  For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to \"\n\" below.\nCompany Performance Metrics\nWe are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:\n•\nstrong, efficient growth;\n•\nconsistent operating discipline; and\n•\nstrategic capital allocation.\nAs we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.\nStrong, Efficient Growth\nOur objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy.  At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year.  The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar.\nCalendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2023 and 2022, were as follows:\nComparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 8.2% and 7.7% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 7.0% and 6.4% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For\n36\nfiscal 2023, comparable sales growth was driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions.  For fiscal 2022, comparable sales growth was driven driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which included strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022 as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.\nComparable sales at Sam's Club increased 14.6% and 15.0% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For fiscal 2023, Sam's Club comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. Sam's Club comparable sales for fiscal 2022 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also included some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years.  The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales\npositively\ncontributed approximately\n0.8%\nand 1.3% to comparable sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nConsistent Operating Discipline\nWe operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve.  We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs.  We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses.\nFor fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment.  These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs.\nFor fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment.\nStrategic Capital Allocation\nOur strategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.  As such, we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain, omni-channel initiatives, technology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings.  The following table provides additional detail:\nReturns\nAs we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time.  We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics.  We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the\nsection.\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics\n37\nto assess returns on assets.  While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.  ROA was 4.6% and 5.6% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in net income, which was driven by lower operating income, partially offset by lapping debt extinguishment charges\n.\nROI was 12.7% and 14.9% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was primarily due to a decrease in operating income which included charges associated with opioid-related legal settlements as well as reorganization and restructuring expenses, all recorded in fiscal 2023.\nWe define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.  Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.  Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\n(1)\nThe average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by 2.\n38\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.  See \"\n\" for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.  We had net cash provided by operating activities of $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  We generated free cash flow of $12.0 billion, $11.1 billion and $25.8 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the timing of certain payments.  Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022 due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 billion in increased capital expenditures.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our\n.\nAlthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.\n(1)\n\"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.\n39\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(1)\nUnit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end, and reflects the removal of stores in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to closing the divestitures in fiscal 2022.  Permanently closed locations are not included in these metrics.\nOur total revenues, which includes net sales and membership and other income, increased $38.5 billion or 6.7% and $13.6 billion or 2.4% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  These increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $38.1 billion or 6.7% and $12.5 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which was driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions, along with positive comparable sales in all of our international markets.  Additionally, net sales were negatively impacted by a decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023.  For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club which benefited from strong U.S. consumer spending and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets. The increase was partially offset by a $32.6 billion net sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales also benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022.\nOur gross profit rate decreased 98 and increased 14 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs and inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment.  For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost inflation as well as merchandise mix, partially offset by increased supply chain costs.\nFor fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal settlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart International segment.  These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs.  For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt was $2.4 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the early retirement of certain higher rate long-term debt to reduce interest expense in future periods.\nOther gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. Other gains and losses consisted of a net loss of $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The net loss in fiscal 2023 primarily consists of: (a) net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity and other investments; (b) a gain of $0.4 billion recognized on the sale of our remaining equity method investment in Brazil; and (c) a $0.2 billion dividend from one of our investments.  The net loss in fiscal 2022 primarily consists of net losses associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, as well as $0.4 billion in incremental losses associated with the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n40\nOur effective income tax rate was 33.6% for fiscal 2023, 25.4% for fiscal 2022, and 33.3% for fiscal 2021, respectively.  The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily due to the tax impact of the business reorganization resulting in the full separation of PhonePe from Flipkart. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the $8.3 billion loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit.  Our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate.  The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 is presented in\n.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $11.3 billion and $13.9 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represents a decrease of $2.6 billion and an increase of $0.2 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart (\"EPS\") was $4.27, $4.87 and $4.75 for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nNet sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $27.3 billion or 6.9% and $23.3 billion or 6.3% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 7.0% and 6.4% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Comparable sales in fiscal 2023 were driven by growth in average ticket, including strong food sales and higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories, as well as growth in transactions.  Comparable sales in fiscal 2022 were driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which included strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years.  Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.\nGross profit rate decreased 85 basis points for fiscal 2023 and increased 51 basis points for fiscal 2022, when compared to the respective previous fiscal year.  The decrease in fiscal 2023 gross profit rate was primarily due to net markdowns and product mix shifts into lower margin categories and increased supply chain costs, partially offset by price management impacts driven by cost inflation.  Gross profit rate for fiscal 2022 benefited from price management driven by cost inflation as well as merchandise mix, which includes lapping the temporary closures of our Auto Care and Vision Centers and growth in our advertising business, partially offset by increased supply chain costs.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 25 basis points for fiscal 2023 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily driven by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by increased wage costs.  For fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points primarily due to investments in wages, partially offset by lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.9 billion.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $1.0 billion and increased $2.5 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n41\nWalmart International Segment\nNet sales for the Walmart International segment were flat and decreased $20.4 billion or 16.8% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, net sales benefited from positive comparable sales in all of our international markets, offset by the impacts of a decrease of $5.0 billion related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as well as $3.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2022, the reduction in net sales was driven by a $32.6 billion decrease primarily related to the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  This decrease was partially offset by positive comparable sales in most of our remaining markets, as well as positive fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $4.5 billion.\nGross profit rate decreased 50 basis points and 55 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in lower margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower margin categories.  For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by shifts into lower margin formats and the impact related to our divested markets.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 41 basis points and decreased 71 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to business reorganization and restructuring charges incurred related to Flipkart and Massmart during the fourth quarter.  For fiscal 2022, the decrease was primarily due to impacts from the divested markets and $0.4 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from depreciation and amortization expense not having been recorded for our operations in the U.K. and Japan subsequent to their held for sale classification at the end of fiscal 2021 and prior to closing during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.8 billion and increased $0.1 billion for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\nSam's Club Segment\n(1)\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices.  Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.  Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment.\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $10.8 billion or 14.7% and $9.6 billion or 15.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 14.6%.  Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories.  Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately\n0.8%\nto comparable sales which was primarily driven by ship to home and curbside pickup.  For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some\n42\nhigher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales.\nGross profit rate decreased 155 basis points and 68 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to inventory write-downs, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs and inflation related LIFO charges.  For fiscal\n2022\n, gross profit rate decreased primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales.\nMembership and other income increased 7.0% and 13.1% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the increase was primarily due to increases in new member sign-ups and Plus member penetration.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 97 basis points and 82 basis points for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.  Fiscal 2023 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales.  Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $0.3 billion and increased $0.4 billion for fiscal\n2023 and\n2022, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.  Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the timing of certain payments.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages.\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\nCash and cash equivalents were $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.5 billion and $6.3 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accrued liabilities.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.\nWe use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. We do not expect current local laws, other existing limitations on anticipated future repatriations of cash amounts held outside the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.\n43\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was\n$17.7 billion\n, $6.0 billion and $10.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and generally consisted of capital expenditures.  Net cash used in investing activities increased\n$11.7 billion for fiscal 2023 when\ncompared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the result of lapping the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan and an increase in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.  Net cash used in investing activities decreased $4.1 billion for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the net proceeds received from the divestitures of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, partially offset by increased capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures\nRefer to the \"\n\" section in our\nfor capital expenditure detail for fiscal 2023 and 2022.  For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 (\"fiscal 2024\"), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $17 billion to $18 billion, with a focus on technology, supply chain, and customer-facing initiatives.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash from financing activities generally consists of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders.  Fiscal 2023 net cash used in financing activities decreased\n$5.8 billion\nwhen compared to the previous fiscal year.  The decrease is primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes in the prior fiscal period, partially offset by the equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock in the prior fiscal period.  Fiscal 2022 net cash used in financing activities increased $6.7 billion when compared to the previous fiscal year.  The increase was primarily due to repayments of long-term debt and related payment of premiums for the early extinguishment of certain notes, as well as increased share repurchases, partially offset by long-term debt issuances and equity funding from the sale of subsidiary stock.\nPurchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stoc\nk\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $0.4 billion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's Massmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership of Massmart from approximately 53% to 100%.  Additionally, the Company completed a $0.4 billion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity and resulted in the Company becoming a 100% owner.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company received $3.2 billion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately 83% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately 75%.\nShort-term Borrowings\nWe generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. The following table includes additional information related to the Company's short-term borrowings for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nShort-term borrowings as of January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.4 billion, with weighted-average interest rates of 6.6% and 2.9%, respectively.  We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31, 2023 that provide additional liquidity, if needed.  Additionally, we maintain access to various credit facilities outside of the U.S. to further support our Walmart International segment operations, as needed.\nAs of January 31, 2023, we have $2.1 billion of syndicated and fronted letters of credit available, of which $1.8 billion was drawn and represents an unrecorded current obligation.\n44\nLong-term Debt\nThe following table provides the changes in our long-term debt for fiscal 2023:\nOur total outstanding long-term debt increased $1.2 billion during fiscal 2023, primarily due to the issuance of new long-term debt in September 2022, partially offset by the maturities of certain long-term debt.  Refer to\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances of long-term debt.\nEstimated contractual interest payments associated with our long-term debt amount to $18.8 billion, with approximately $1.7 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2024.  Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable rate instruments.\nDividends\nOur total dividend payments were\n$6.1 billion\n, $6.2 billion and $6.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Effective February 21, 2023, the Company approved the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share.  For fiscal 2024, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:\nCompany Share Repurchase Program\nFrom time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022.  In November 2022, the Company approved a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program which, beginning on November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program.  As of January 31, 2023, authorization for $\n19.3 billion\nof share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.\nWe regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.  We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow.\nThe following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nMaterial cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations.  Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include opioid and other legal settlements, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases, purchases of subsidiary stock and purchase obligations.  See\n,\nand\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding purchase of subsidiary stock, outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n45\nAs of January 31, 2023, the Company has $33.3 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $11.6 billion is due within one year.  Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts.  Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above.  Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods.  We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.  Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\nCapital Resources\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.\nWe have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets.  As of January 31, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:\nCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time.  Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time.  Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy.  Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.  In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing.  The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities.  Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.\n46\nOther Matters\nIn\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned \"Contingencies\" and appears in\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"\n,\" we discuss, under the sub-captions \"\nSettlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation\n,\" and \"\nOther Opioid Related Litigation\n\" the Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, and other matters, including certain risks arising therefrom.  In that\n, we also discuss under the sub-caption \"\nAsda Equal Value Claims\"\nthe Company's indemnification obligation for the Asda Equal Value Claims matter as well as under the sub-caption \"\nMoney Transfer Agent Services Matters\n\", a United States Federal Trade Commission complaint related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program and a government investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania into the Company's consumer fraud prevention and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer agent services.  We discuss various legal proceedings related to the Federal and State Prescription Opiate Litigation, the Settlement Framework, DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation and Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation in\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"\n,\" under the sub-caption \"I. Supplemental Information.\" We also discuss items related to the Asda Equal Value Claims matter, the Money Transfer Agent Services Matters and the Foreign Direct Investment matters in\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"\n,\" under the sub-caption \"II. Certain Other Matters.\"  We also discuss an environmental matter with the State of California in\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption \"\n,\" under the sub-caption \"III. Environmental Matters.\"  The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nManagement strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.  In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.  These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes.  Actual results may differ from our estimates.\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements.  Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\nInventories\nThe Walmart U.S. segment comprises the largest portion of our inventory and is primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") valuation method.  The majority of the Sam's Club segment inventories are accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.  As a measure of sensitivity, an incremental 1% inflationary impact to the cost of our inventory purchases would not have resulted in a material increase to the LIFO provision recorded during fiscal 2023.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives.  Indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary.  If we determine, after performing an assessment based on qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed.  The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions.  Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost.  Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of\n47\namounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made.  Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.\nOur tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.  The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.  When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.  We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.  This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years.  Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on estimates.\nAs guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance."

    "text": "Market Risk\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair values of certain equity and equity method investments measured on a recurring basis.\nThe analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes.  The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption.  In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps.  For fiscal 2023, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $0.6 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted.  The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts.  The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2023.\n48\n(1)\nIncludes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt.\nAs of January 31, 2023, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 21% of our total short-term and long-term debt.  Based on January 31, 2023 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than the U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt.  For fiscal 2023, movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $1.1 billion net loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nWe hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps.  The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in a liability position of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively.  The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2023.  The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.7 billion.  A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2023 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.1 billion.\nIn certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInvestment Risk\nWe are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where we have elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis.  These changes in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a loss of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily due to net decreases in the underlying stock prices of those investments.  As of January 31, 2023, the fair value of our equity investments, including certain equity method investments, measured on a recurring basis was $10.7 billion.  As of January 31, 2023, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments by approximately $1.1 billion.\n49"

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRogers, Arkansas\nMarch 17, 2023\n53\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nSee accompanying notes.\n54\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nSee accompanying notes.\n55\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying notes.\n56\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity\nSee accompanying notes.\n57\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying notes.\n58\nWalmart Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nWalmart Inc. (\"Walmart\" or the \"Company\") people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail stores and through eCommerce.  Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers.\nThe Company's operations comprise\nthree\nreportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\") and January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\").  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.  Investments in common stock or in-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity method.  These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2023 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.  Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents.  The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world.  Of the Company's $\n8.6\nbillion and $\n14.8\nbillion in cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, approximately\n62\n% and\n50\n% were held outside of the U.S., respectively.  Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.\nThe Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $\n2.9\nbillion and $\n4.3\nbillion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.\nReceivables\nReceivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: customers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and electronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; governments for income taxes; and real estate transactions.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, net receivables from transactions with customers were $\n3.7\nbillion and $\n3.4\nbillion, respectively.\n59\nInventories\nThe Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store formats and businesses in each of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net realizable value, as appropriate.\n•\nWalmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting (\"RIM\") to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") valuation method.  RIM generally results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.\n•\nWalmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted for using either the RIM or weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method.\n•\nSam's Club Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method.\nFor those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation.  These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for inflation or deflation and inventory levels.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost.  Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred.  Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term.\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n10.9\nbillion, $\n10.7\nbillion and $\n11.2\nbillion, respectively.\nLeases\nFor any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease.  The Company records right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are initially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease.  If the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not readily determinable, the Company's applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the present value of the sum of the lease payments.\nLease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease obligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.\nFor a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. For leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such as common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.\n60\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level.  Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired.  Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.\nGoodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition.  Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.  As of January 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units.  Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required.  The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units.  Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches.  Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2023 and 2022:\nIntangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $\n4.3\nbillion and $\n4.8\nbillion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily consists of acquired trade names.  There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction.  The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.\nRefer to\nfor more information.\nInvestments\nInvestments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in fair value of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $\n1.7\nbillion and $\n2.4\nbillion for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively and net gains of $\n8.6\nbillion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to net changes in the underlying stock prices of those investments.  Refer to\nfor details.  Equity investments without readily\n61\ndeterminable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInvestments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value and adjustments in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company had $\n0.5\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively, in debt securities classified as trading.\nIndemnification Liabilities\nThe Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification liabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company had $\n0.6\nbillion and $\n0.7\nbillion, respectively, of certain legal indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred income taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The maximum of potential future payments under these indemnities was $\n3.1\nbillion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2023.\nSelf Insurance Reserves\nThe Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits.  Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis.  The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments.  On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.  To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.\nDerivatives\nThe Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.  Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks.  The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives.  Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty.  The Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally \"A-\" or better by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures with counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company's collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, after considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and cash collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangement\ns was not significant\nas of January 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge.  If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded through the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings.  Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date.  Refer to\nfor the presentation of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt.  All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP.  Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.  These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2023 to September 2031.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt.  The Company records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2024 to January 2039.\n62\nNet Investment Hedges\nPrior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in\n, the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations.  Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in\n.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\").  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  These sources of income rely on estimates.\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates.  Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nThe Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to\nfor additional income tax disclosures.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nNoncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company's control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are\npresented as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are\nrecorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each\nreporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are recognized in capital in excess of par.  As of January 31, 2023, the Company has a redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option\nwhich may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027 with annual options thereafter.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet Sales\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer.  eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer.  Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\nMembership Fee Revenue\nThe Company recognizes membership fee revenue over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months.  Membership fee revenue was $\n2.6\nbillion for fiscal 2023, $\n2.2\nbillion for fiscal 2022 and $\n1.7\nbillion for fiscal 2021.  Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n63\nGift Cards\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card.  Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely.  Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates.  While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed.  Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\nFinancial, Advertising and Other Services\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed.  Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers.  Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.\nPayments from Suppliers\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and supplier-specific fixtures.  Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.\nOperating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above.  As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.  Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAdvertising costs were $\n4.1\nbillion, $\n3.9\nbillion and $\n3.2\nbillion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCurrency Translation\nThe assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for disclosure of rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.\n64\nNote 2.\nNet Income Per Common Share\nBasic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period.  Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards.  The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart:\nNote 3.\nShareholders' Equity\nThe total authorized shares of $\n0.10\npar value common stock is\n11.0\nbillion, of which\n2.7\nbillion and\n2.8\nbillion were issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPurchases and Sales of Subsidiary Stock\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed a $\n0.4\nbillion buyout of the noncontrolling interest shareholders of the Company's\nMassmart subsidiary. This transaction increased the Company's ownership in Massmart from approximately\n53\n% to\n100\n%.  Additionally, the Company completed a $\n0.4\nbillion acquisition of Alert Innovation, which was previously consolidated as a variable interest entity, and resulted in the Company becoming a\n100\n% owner.\nAlso during fiscal 2023, the Company increased its ownership in PhonePe, a digital transaction platform in India, from approximately\n76\n% to approximately\n89\n% as part of the separation from the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary.  In consideration for the transaction, the Company recorded a liability to noncontrolling interest holders of $\n0.9\nbillion within accrued liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company received $\n3.2\nbillion primarily related to a new equity funding for the Company's majority-owned Flipkart subsidiary, which reduced the Company's ownership from approximately\n83\n% as of January 31, 2021 to approximately\n75\n%.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company.  The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $\n1.6\nbillion, $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  The total income tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $\n0.4\nbillion, $\n0.3\nbillion and $\n0.3\nbillion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense by award type for all plans:\nThe Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the \"Plan\"), as subsequently amended and restated, was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other equity compensation\n65\nawards for which\n260\nmillion shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.\nThe Plan's award types are summarized as follows:\n•\nRestricted Stock Units.\nRestricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period.  Beginning in fiscal 2023, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of\n8\n% each quarter over a\nthree year\nperiod from the date of grant.  For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of\n25\n% each year over a\nfour year\nperiod from the date of the grant.  Prior to fiscal 2020,\n50\n% of restricted stock units generally vested\nthree years\nfrom the grant date and the remaining\n50\n% were vested\nfive years\nfrom the grant date.  The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was\n2.3\n%,\n3.8\n% and\n4.4\n%, respectively.\n•\nRestricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units.\nRestricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment.  Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from\n0\n% to\n150\n% of the original award amount.  Vesting periods for restricted stock are generally between\none month\nand\nthree years\n.  Vesting periods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally between\none\nand\nthree years\n.  Restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period.  The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was\n3.3\n%,\n4.2\n% and\n4.5\n%, respectively.\nIn addition to the Plan, Flipkart and PhonePe have share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to acquire their own common shares may be issued.  These plans may be subject to performance or other conditions, including vesting upon an initial public offering. Share-based compensation expense associated with certain of these plans is included in the Other line in the table above.\nThe following table shows the activity for restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units during fiscal 2023:\n(1)\nRepresents the adjustment to previously granted performance share units for performance achievement.\nThe following table includes additional information related to restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units:\n66\nShare Repurchase Program\nFrom time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.  All repurchases made during the fiscal year prior to November 21, 2022 were made under the plan in effect at the beginning of fiscal 2022.  In November 2022, the Company approved a new $\n20.0\nbillion share repurchase program which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases, and beginning November 21, 2022, replaced the previous share repurchase program.  As of January 31, 2023 authorization for $\n19.3\nbillion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program.  Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.\nThe Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nNote 4.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table provides the changes in the composition of total accumulated other comprehensive loss for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(1)\nIncludes a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $\n0.8\nbillion, for which there was no related income taxes, upon sale of the majority stake in Walmart Argentina.  Refer to\n.\n(2)\nUpon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss, the majority of which was considered in the impairment evaluation when the individual disposal groups met the held for sale classification in fiscal 2021.\n(3)\nUpon closing of the noncontrolling interest shareholder buyout of the Company's Massmart subsidiary during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the cumulative amount of currency translation was reallocated from the Company's noncontrolling interest back to the Company. Refer to\n.\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss for foreign currency on matured bonds (reflected in currency translation and other) and derivatives are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  The amounts for the minimum pension liability, as well as the cumulative translation resulting from the disposition of a business, are recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  Amounts related to the Company's derivatives expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income during the next 12 months are not significant.\n67\nNote 5.\nAccrued Liabilities\nThe Company's accrued liabilities consist of the following as of January 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)\nAccrued wages and benefits include accrued wages, salaries, vacation, bonuses and other incentive plans.\n(2)\nSelf-insurance consists of insurance-related liabilities, such as workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits.\n(3)\nAccrued non-income taxes include accrued payroll, property, value-added, sales and miscellaneous other taxes.\n(4)\nRepresents the remaining balance for the opioids litigation settlement. See\n.\n(5)\nOther accrued liabilities includes items such as deferred membership revenue, the purchase of PhonePe stock (see\n), interest, supply chain, advertising, and maintenance & utilities.\nNote 6.\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\nShort-term borrowings consist of commercial paper and lines of credit.  Short-term borrowings as of January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $\n0.4\nbillion, with weighted-average interest rates of\n6.6\n% and\n2.9\n%, respectively.\nThe Company has various committed lines of credit in the U.S. to support its commercial paper program and are summarized in the following table:\n(1)\nIn April 2022, the Company renewed and extended its existing\n364\n-day revolving credit facility as well as its\nfive year\ncredit facility.\nThe committed lines of credit in the table above mature in April 2023 and April 2027, carry interest rates of SOFR plus\n60\nbasis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between\n1.5\nand\n4.0\nbasis points.  In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt.  Additionally, the Company has syndicated and fronted letters of credit available which totaled $\n2.1\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $\n1.8\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion was drawn as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in\n, consists of the following as of January 31, 2023 and 2022:\n(1)\nThe average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates.\n(2)\nIncludes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt.\n68\nAnnual maturities of long-term debt during the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nDebt Issuances\nInformation on significant long-term debt issued during fiscal 2023, for general corporate purposes, is as follows:\nThese issuances are senior, unsecured notes which rank equally with all other senior, unsecured debt obligations of the Company, and are not convertible or exchangeable. These issuances do not contain any financial covenants which restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends or repurchase Company stock.  Additionally, the Company received immaterial proceeds from debt issuances by certain international markets.\nMaturities and Extinguishments\nThe following table provides details of debt repayments during fiscal 2023:\n69\nThe following table provides details of debt repayments during fiscal 2022:\n(1)\nRepresents portion of the outstanding principal amount which was repaid during fiscal 2022.\nIndividual repayment amounts may not sum due to rounding.\nThe Company recorded a $\n2.4\nbillion loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal 2022, which included payment of $\n2.3\nbillion in early extinguishment premiums.\nNote 7.\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain retail locations, distribution and fulfillment centers, warehouses, office spaces, land and equipment throughout the U.S. and internationally.\nThe Company's lease costs recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income consist of the following:\n70\nOther lease information is as follows:\nThe aggregate annual lease obligations at January 31, 2023, are as follows:\nNote 8.\nFair Value Measurements\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n•\nLevel 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n•\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n•\nLevel 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nAs described in\n, the Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method investments, on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe fair values of the Company's equity investments measured on a recurring basis are as follows:\n71\nDerivatives\nThe Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value.  Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.  The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:\n(1)\nPrimarily classified in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.\nUpon completing the sales of the Company's operations in the U.K. in February 2021 and Japan in March 2021, the Company recorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $\n0.4\nbillion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to\n. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2023.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale criteria in fiscal 2021, as further discussed in\n.  As a result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration. The carrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the Company recognized non-recurring impairment charges.  The aggregate pre-tax loss of $\n8.3\nbillion associated with the divestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021, and included these impairment charges as well as a $\n2.3\nbillion charge related to the Asda pension plan.  These impairment charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nThe Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nThe Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\nThe carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\nNote 9.\nTaxes\nThe components of income before income taxes are as follows:\n72\nA summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows:\nEffective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation\nA reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pre-tax income from continuing operations is as follows:\nThe following sections regarding deferred taxes, unremitted earnings, net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards, valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions exclude amounts related to operations classified as held for sale.\nDeferred Taxes\nThe significant components of the Company's deferred tax account balances are as follows:\n73\nThe deferred taxes noted above are classified as follows in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nUnremitted Earnings\nPrior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2023, the Company has not recorded approximately $\n3\nbillion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.\nNet Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances\nAs of January 31, 2023, the Company's net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $\n32.3\nbillion.  Of these carryforwards, approximately $\n19.6\nbillion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2043.  The remaining carryforwards have no expiration.\nThe realizability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established.  To the extent that a valuation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Company had valuation allowances of approximately $\n7.8\nbillion and $\n9.5\nbillion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2023 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration of unrealized deferred tax assets.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $\n3.3\nbillion and $\n3.2\nbillion, respectively.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.  During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance.  The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n74\nThe Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2018 through 2022.  The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for fiscal 2013 through 2022, and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2015 through 2022. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2013.\nOther Taxes\nThe Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes.  A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions.  In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations.  Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 10.\nContingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.\nUnless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSettlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $\n3.3\nbillion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Moreover, the Settlement Framework will only take effect once a sufficient number of political subdivisions join, and there is no assurance regarding such participation. The amount of ultimate loss may thus differ materially from this accrual. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation.\nIn December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the \"MDL\") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL.\nSimilar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or pending state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $\n3.1\nbillion (the \"Settlement Amount\"). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the \"Settlement Framework.\"\nThe Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all\n50\nstates, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other\n75\nU.S. territories (the \"Settling States\"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. The settlement with the Settling States is now contingent upon, among other applicable terms and conditions, a sufficient number of political subdivisions also agreeing to participate in the Settlement Framework.\nIf all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable for political subdivisions are satisfied within the prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States, beginning as early as the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and being completed during fiscal 2024. However, the Company cannot predict if, when, or to what extent the Settlement Framework will be finalized with any of the Settling States.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company paid $\n0.4\nbillion for separate settlements with Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, and Florida. Following these payments, the remaining $\n2.9\nbillion liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements is recorded in accrued liabilities within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023.\nThe Settlement Framework also provides for payments to Native American tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation), contingent upon the number of tribes, including those tribes that have not yet sued the Company, that agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline (the \"Settling Tribes\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Framework, on March 3, 2023, the Company paid approximately $\n0.1\nbillion to the Settling Tribes in satisfaction of their claims against the Company.\nOther Opioid Related Litigation\nThe Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise extinguished by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers, as well as any action filed by a state, political subdivision, or Native American tribe that does not agree to the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.\nTwo-county Trial and MDL Bellwethers.\nThe liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all\nthree\ndefendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $\n0.7\nbillion over\nfifteen years\n, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023.\nThe MDL has designated\nfive\nadditional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these\nfive\ncounties ultimately may elect to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go to trial.\nDOJ Opioid Civil Litigation.\nOn December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.\nOpioid Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation.\nIn addition, the Company is the subject of\ntwo\nsecurities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022 and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.\nDerivative actions were also filed by\ntwo\nof the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and\ntwo\ncurrent officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures.  Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters.  On September 27, 2021,\nthree\nshareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the\n76\ncurrent Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. On September 26, 2022, the court held a hearing on that motion, and a ruling remains pending.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nAsda Equal Value Claims.\nAsda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the \"Asda Equal Value Claims\"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters.\nMoney Transfer Agent Services Matters.\nThe Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, on October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. The court has entered an order staying discovery pending a decision on the Company's motion to dismiss. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.\nNote 11.\nRetirement-Related Benefits\nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire.  The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after\none year\nof employment.  Under these plans, after\none year\nof employment, the Company matches\n100\n% of participant contributions up to\n6\n% of annual eligible earnings.  The matching contributions immediately vest at\n100\n% for each associate.  Participants can contribute up to\n50\n% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits.\nAssociates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements.  These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.\nThe following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company's defined contribution plans for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nAdditionally, the Company's previously owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom sponsored a defined benefit pension plan.  In fiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the \"Plan\") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Asda made a cash contribution of $\n1.0\nbillion to the Plan (the \"Asda Pension Contribution\") which enabled the Plan to purchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants, and released the Plan and Asda from any future obligations.  In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $\n2.3\nbillion were included in the disposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in\nand\n.\n77\nNote 12.\nDisposals, Acquisitions and Related Items\nThe following dispositions impact the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred.\nAsda\nIn February 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company's retail operations in the U.K., for net consideration of $\n9.6\nbillion.  Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $\n0.2\nbillion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized its retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax indemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAsda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $\n5.5\nbillion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.  Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $\n2.3\nbillion of accumulated pension components associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss.  In calculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $\n0.8\nbillion related to the estimated fair value of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs.\nSeiyu\nIn March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company's retail operations in Japan, for net consideration of $\n1.2\nbillion.  Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $\n0.2\nbillion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its retained\n15\npercent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSeiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $\n1.9\nbillion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nWalmart Argentina\nIn November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $\n1.0\nbillion in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to the impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group.\nNote 13.\nSegments and Disaggregated Revenue\nSegments\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.  The Company previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to\nfor discussion of recent divestitures.  The Company's operations are conducted in\nthree\nreportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect.  The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.  The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly\n78\nreviewed by its CODM.\nInformation for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table:\nTotal revenues, consisting of net sales and membership and other income, and long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, net and lease right-of-use assets, aggregated by the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, are as follows:\nNo individual country outside of the U.S. had total revenues or long-lived assets that were material to the consolidated totals.  Long-lived assets related to operations classified as held for sale are excluded from the table above.  Additionally, the Company did not generate material revenues from any single customer.\n79\nDisaggregated Revenues\nIn the following tables, segment net sales are disaggregated by either merchandise category or market.  In addition, net sales related to eCommerce are provided for each segment, which include omni-channel sales where a customer initiates an order digitally and the order is fulfilled through a store or club.\nOf Walmart U.S.'s total net sales, approximately $\n53.4\nbillion, $\n47.8\nbillion and $\n43.0\nbillion related to eCommerce for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOf Walmart International's total net sales, approximately $\n20.3\nbillion, $\n18.5\nbillion and $\n16.6\nbillion related to eCommerce for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOf Sam's Club's total net sales, approximately $\n8.4\nbillion, $\n6.9\nbillion and $\n5.3\nbillion related to eCommerce for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 14.\nSubsequent Event\nDividends Declared\nThe Company approved, effective February 21, 2023, the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $\n2.28\nper share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 dividend of $\n2.24\nper share.\nFor fiscal 2024, the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $\n0.57\nper share, according to the following record and payable dates:\n80"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls.  These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective.\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023.  In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (\"COSO\") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).  Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2023.  The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will begin upgrading our financial system, including our general ledger and other applications, in stages. This financial system will continue to be a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting as it is implemented."
