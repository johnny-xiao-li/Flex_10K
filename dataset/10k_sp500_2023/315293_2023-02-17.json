We partner with clients to deliver our scale and experience to help them effectively manage their investments, risk, and governance and potentially lower costs. We believe in the power of connecting participants to experts to make better informed and smarter decisions about their wealth.\nRevenue and Compensation\nOur business generates revenues primarily through commissions, compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services we provide to them, and fees from customers. Commissions and fees for brokerage services vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services provided to a client, insurer, or reinsurer, and the capacity in which we act. Compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies includes: (1) fees for consulting and analytics services, and (2) fees and commissions for administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers and reinsurers. Fees from clients for advice and consulting services are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide. Payment terms are consistent with current industry practices.\nFunds Held on Behalf of Clients\nWe typically hold funds on behalf of clients, including premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit to and from insurers. Certain funds held on behalf of clients are invested in interest-bearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect and remit cash. The principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes, although we may earn interest on these accounts.\nCompetition\nOur business operates in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. We compete with numerous other global insurance brokers and consulting companies, including, among others, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, Arthur J Gallagher & Company, Lockton Companies, Inc., as well as numerous other global, regional, and local firms in almost every area of our business. We also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that directly market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents. Additionally, we compete with\n8\nother businesses that do not fall into the categories above, including large financial institutions and independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms.\nSeasonality\nDue to buying patterns and delivery of certain products and services in the markets we serve, revenues recognized tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.\nLicensing and Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate, including U.S. federal and state laws. See the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRegulatory authorities in the U.S. and most other countries in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individuals, entities, and related service providers to obtain a license from a government agency, including (but not limited to) licenses to operate as insurance producers, brokers, agents, consultants, reinsurance brokers, or managing general agents.\nCertain jurisdictions issue licenses only to resident entities or individuals. In such jurisdictions, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process.\nOur subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are enforced by the FCA in the U.K., by federal and state agencies in the U.S., and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business, the licensing of agents, the monitoring of trade practices, policy form approval, limits on commission rates, and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements.\nInsurance authorities in the U.K., U.S., and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.\nInvestment, securities, and futures licensing authorities also govern certain business activities. For example, in the U.S., we use Aon Securities LLC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Aon, and a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member of FINRA and Securities Investor Protection Corporation, for investment banking, capital advisory services and other broker-dealer activities. Similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S.\nFurther, pension and financial laws and regulations, including oversight and supervision by the FCA in the U.K., the SEC and the DOL in the U.S., and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirement-related consulting services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes Aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various U.S. federal authorities including the SEC, DOL, and FINRA, as well as authorities on the state level. In addition, other services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates, such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services, are subject in various jurisdictions to pension, investment, securities, and insurance laws and regulations, and supervision.\nClientele\nOur clients operate in many businesses and industries throughout the world. No one client accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated total revenues in 2022. Additionally, we place insurance with many insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2022.\nAon United, Our Culture, and Human Capital Strategy\nOur Culture\nOur culture is driven by our values – committed as one firm to our purpose, united through trust as one inclusive, diverse team, and passionate about making our colleagues and clients successful. Our colleagues are the cornerstone of Aon's success. Collaboration and innovation drive our culture, bringing the best of Aon to clients in a holistic and seamless manner. Our Aon United strategy defines how Aon colleagues work together to deliver value to clients, setting a new standard for client leadership. Aon United is brought to life through our common client value creation model which scales strategies from across\n9\nthe firm to bring the best of Aon to clients. Each year, Aon makes significant philanthropic contributions to various organizations, supports numerous colleague volunteer opportunities, and offers paid time off to volunteer.\nColleagues\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 50,000 employees and conducted our operations in more than 120 countries and sovereignties. Our colleagues’ diverse talents, expertise, and insights contribute to the success of both our firm and our clients, and we seek to attract, grow, and retain the best talent in the industry. Our Inclusive People Leadership strategy is a central part of our Aon United Blueprint and is a key enabler to realizing our aspirations and purpose as a firm. At Aon, all colleagues are called upon to be leaders in embracing and modelling our Aon United values and behaviors. Inclusive People Leadership at Aon ensures that all colleagues – at every stage of their career journey – are equipped and motivated to deliver on our purpose and able to achieve their full potential. Colleagues benefit from our “Smart Working” approach. The aim of Smart Working is to create a healthy, productive, inclusive, and sustainable way of working, enabling colleagues to deliver their best work for clients from wherever they are best placed to do so. This strategy, which supports in person, hybrid, and virtual working, continues to be a source of positive feedback and strong engagement based on colleague surveys.\nTraining and Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and remain an attractive employer. Colleagues are invited to complete a variety of curricula to meet their career stage goals and developmental needs. We provide our colleagues what they need to learn, grow, and become the leaders our clients seek. From self-guided learning courses to advanced leadership programs, the curriculum is aligned to the Aon United Blueprint and Inclusive People Leader strategy. Aon’s investment in technology and use of virtual based learning and development programs allows us to deliver targeted offerings designed to advance all colleagues’ development.\nColleague Engagement and Retention\nProviding an engaging and rewarding colleague experience is a top priority for our firm and understanding colleagues’ feedback helps us reach that goal. We use a variety of channels to facilitate open, on-going, and direct communication with colleagues. These channels include open forums and town halls with executives, colleague surveys, and engagement through our Business Resource Groups. Business Resource Groups are our independent, voluntary, non-profit associations that provide input, take action, and help identify opportunities for our firm to further commitments to I&D and belonging.\nOur engagement survey process consists of frequent pulse surveys, as well as our annual all colleague support survey which enables us to understand how colleagues are engaging with their teams, the firm, and clients. This outreach effort allows us to gather insights more rapidly, take timely action to address feedback, and deliver on the needs of colleagues in real time – ensuring colleagues feel more connected, more valued and more relevant. The pulse surveys for 2022 were focused on topics such as manager and leadership support, delivering on our Aon Story, colleague wellbeing, I&D, talent acquisition and performance & rewards. Aon’s feedback from our workforce provides management a better understanding of evolving colleague viewpoints, and ensures we are taking appropriate steps to drive colleague engagement and retention. For discussion of the risks related to the attraction and retention of senior management and other professional personnel, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nRewards\nIn addition to an inspired purpose and culture, we are proud to offer our colleagues a total rewards program that combines competitive pay, incentive opportunities, and benefits. Our compensation programs, including salary, recognition, cash, and equity incentives, are connected to our formal performance management, and career development approach. These programs serve to reward colleagues for their Aon United impact both in what they accomplish for clients, colleagues, and shareholders, how they achieve those results and how they deliver on our values. We maintain a global commitment to colleague wellbeing and play a key role in supporting colleagues across the physical, emotional, financial, and social spectrum. Our comprehensive benefit programs are competitive for the markets in which we operate and aligned with our values and culture. Eligible colleagues that were active on September 24, 2021 received a one-time stock based award enabling Aon colleagues to share in the future success of our Aon United mission.\nOur compensation philosophy aligns with our Aon United strategy and delivering long-term shareholder value creation. Our executive incentives are based on driving results, delivery of strategic initiatives, and leadership. Beginning in 2021, 20% of the short-term incentives for senior executives are based on quantifiable performance against firm-wide I&D initiatives.\nInclusion and Diversity\nWe believe that inclusive and diverse teams produce better insight, better solutions, and ultimately the best outcomes for clients and Aon’s long-term success.\n10\nWe are focused on being a firm that is representative of the communities in which we operate. We achieve this by aligning I&D actions to the following pillars: Recruitment, Education, Promotion, and Representation. We strongly believe that only when colleagues can be their authentic selves will they reach their full potential.\nOur commitment to I&D starts from the top with our Board of Directors, including its I&D Sub-Committee. Our Global Inclusive Leadership Council is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief People Officer. Regional Inclusive Leadership Councils and our Executive Leadership Teams are aligned to drive actions to increase the diversity of our teams. Our colleague-led Business Resource Groups also support execution and provide additional opportunities for colleagues to enhance our inclusive environment.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Aon’s global workforce was 54% women and 46% men, and the Aon Executive Committee which leads the firm was 48% women and 52% men. At the manager level, 28% of senior leaders and 43% of managers with one or more direct report were women. New colleague hires for the year were 51% women and 49% men. Aon’s U.S. workforce was 25% racially or ethnically diverse, calculated as a percentage of colleagues that have voluntarily disclosed their race or ethnicity to Aon. At the manager level, 13% of U.S. senior leaders and 18% of U.S. managers with one or more direct report were racially or ethnically diverse. New colleague hires for the year in the U.S. were 31% racially or ethnically diverse.\nOur Apprenticeship Program\nApprenticeship programs help build a talent pipeline of highly skilled and diverse professionals while providing apprentices with advanced education and work experience. By removing some of the traditional barriers to entry-level employment, Aon can contribute to local workforce development and cultivate talent while improving retention rates in these entry-level roles. As a founding member of seven apprentice networks within the U.S., we partner with companies and organizations to assist them in building their own programs through sharing best practices and learnings. Across these networks, we have over 160 organizations committed as of December 31, 2022.\nAon's two-year Apprenticeship Program, which was implemented in the U.K. and U.S. in 2012 and 2017, respectively, serves as an alternate route into a permanent role that normally requires a specific degree or professional experience. Aon provides motivated, high-potential individuals with the required training (on the job and in the classroom), professional skills development, mentorship, and experiential learning to bridge the gap. Over 585 Aon apprentices have been hired since the inception of the program across the U.S. and U.K. Both programs are certified apprenticeship programs, by the Department of Labor in the U.S. and the Department of Education in the U.K.\nWebsite Access to Reports and Other Information\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through our website (http://www.aon.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

    "text": "The risk factors set forth below reflect risks associated with our existing and potential businesses and the industries in which we operate generally and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in the “Business” Section of Part I, Item 1 of this report. Readers should consider these risks in addition to the other information contained in this report because our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks were to actually occur and the occurrence of such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in or implied by the forward-looking statements in this document and elsewhere.\n11\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAn overall decline in economic and business activity could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of our business.\nThe results of our operations are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the economy of the industries and markets these clients serve. Economic downturns, volatility, or uncertainty in the broader economy or in specific markets (including as a result of endemics or pandemics, climate change, political unrest, actions by central banks, or otherwise) may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business or reductions in existing business. If our clients become financially less stable, enter bankruptcy, liquidate their operations or consolidate, our revenues and collectability of receivables could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our Commercial Risk Solutions and Reinsurance Solutions lines. The economic activity that impacts property and casualty insurance is most closely correlated with employment levels, corporate revenues, and asset values. Downward fluctuations in the year-over-year insurance premiums charged by insurers to protect against the same risk, referred to in the industry as softening of the insurance market, could adversely affect these businesses as a significant portion of the revenue is determined as a percentage of premiums charged to our clients. In addition, certain discretionary services within our business, such as Human Capital, project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions, and transaction liability, may see a decrease in activity if the overall level of economic activity results in a reduction to our clients’ discretionary spending. Insolvencies and consolidations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Also, error and omission claims against us, which we refer to as E&O claims, may increase in economic downturns, also adversely affecting our business. In addition, decreased underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance may create difficulty for our professionals to place business, which may adversely impact our ability to earn revenue.\nWe face significant competitive pressures from traditional and non-traditional competitors that could affect our business.\nAs a global professional services firm, we compete with global, national, regional, and local insurance companies that market and service their own products, other financial services providers, brokers, and investment managers, independent firms, and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, human resources consulting, and financial services firms. We compete with respect to service, delivery of insights, product features, price, commission structure, technology, financial strength, ability to access certain insurance markets, and name recognition. Our competitors may have better financial, technical and marketing resources, broader customer bases, greater name recognition, more comprehensive products, stronger presence in certain geographies, or more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have.\nAlliances or mergers among competitors could affect our business. Further, we compete on pricing and the innovation and quality of our service offerings and could be affected by competitors’ lower cost structures, product development activities, and pricing policies, any or all of which could result in better market acceptance of our competitors’ offerings than those that we offer or develop.\nThis competition is further intensified by an industry trend where clients elect to engage multiple brokers to service different portions of their accounts. If we fail to respond successfully to the evolving competition we face, our financial condition or results of operations might be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively develop and implement innovative strategies, efficiencies and new solutions for our clients, our reputation, ability to compete effectively and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nDeveloping and implementing innovative strategies, efficient business practices, and new solutions to current and emerging client needs is important to our business. We may be unsuccessful in developing innovative strategies, or our competitors may be more successful in innovating and delivering services to meet new and existing client needs. Competitors may be able to innovate faster and respond better to evolving client demand and industry conditions, or price their services more aggressively than we do. Further, new and non- traditional competitors, our clients’ increasing ability and determination to self-insure, and capital market alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance markets cause additional forms of competition and innovation that could affect our business. If we are unsuccessful in innovating, if we cannot innovate as quickly as our competitors, if we are not able to make sufficient investment in innovation, if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, or if our ideas are not accepted in the marketplace, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements.\n12\nFor example, we have invested significantly in the development of our proprietary data and analytics tools including repositories of global insurance and reinsurance placement information, which we use to drive results for our clients in the insurance and reinsurance placement process. Our competitors have or are developing competing data and analytics tools, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. Innovations in software, cloud computing, data and analytics or other technologies that alter how our services are delivered could significantly undermine our investment in the business if we are slow to innovate or unable to take advantage of these developments.\nIn addition, innovation in technology, capabilities, and the entry into new lines of business, services, or products require significant investment and present additional risks to the Company, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful and could result in reputational damage to us; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts, including potential E&O or other claims.\nIf our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities, damage to our reputation, or legal liability.\nWe depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality advice and solutions. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it could cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability, or lose the client relationship altogether. Moreover, if we fail to meet our contractual, common law or fiduciary obligations, we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships.\nThe nature of much of our work involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. For example, in our investment businesses, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming, or data entry or management errors. A client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice or reporting, which poses risks of liability exposure and costs of defense and increased insurance premiums. Many of our clients are businesses that actively share information among themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Adverse statements or claims from clients (including clients in the public sector or whose activities are frequently covered by the press) may receive media attention or other publicity. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients.\nDamage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe advise our clients on and provide services related to a wide range of subjects and our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, financial condition, and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters or others could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients and existing and future employees, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us. Damage to our reputation, including as a result of negative perceptions or publicity regarding a class of business, environmental matters, climate change, workforce diversity, pay equity, harassment, social justice, cyber security or data privacy, or our inability to meet commitments or client and stakeholder expectations with respect to such matters, could affect the confidence of our clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders, employees and third parties in transactions that are important to our business adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRevenues from commission arrangements may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets outside of our control.\nRevenues from commission arrangements have historically been affected by significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the industries in which we operate. A significant portion of our revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We have no control over premium rates, and our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to pricing cyclicality in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.\nIn addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by:\n•\nthe growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs, including a greater willingness on the part of corporations to “self-insure,” the use of so-called “captive” insurers, and the development of\n13\ncapital markets-based solutions and other alternative capital sources for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs that increase market capacity, increase competition, and put pressure on premiums;\n•\ndecreases in available underwriting capacity for insurance and reinsurance;\n•\nfluctuation in the need for, or relevancy of, insurance;\n•\nthe level of compensation, as a percentage of premium, that insurance carriers are willing to compensate brokers for placement activity;\n•\nthe growing desire of clients to move away from variable commission rates and instead compensate brokers based upon flat fees, which can negatively impact us as fees are not consistently indexed for inflation and may not rise as much as commission-based compensation;\n•\ncompetition from insurers seeking to sell their products directly to consumers, including online sales, without the involvement of an insurance broker; and\n•\ngrowing number of technology-enabled competitors offering new risk-transfer solutions that eliminate the traditional broker-client relationship in both commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.\nThe profitability of our operations may not meet our expectations due to unexpected costs, cost overruns, inflation, early contract terminations, unrealized assumptions used in our contract bidding process or the inability to maintain our prices.\nOur profitability is highly dependent upon our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency. As we adapt to changes in our business and the market, adapt to the regulatory environment, enter into new engagements, acquire additional businesses, and take on new employees in new locations, we may not be able to manage our large, diverse and changing workforce, control our costs, or improve our efficiency.\nOur profit margin, and therefore our profitability, is largely a function of the revenue generated from our services and the staffing costs for our personnel and related expenses. Accordingly, if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or appropriately manage the staffing costs of our personnel and related expenses, we may not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer. The prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including competitive factors, the extent of ongoing clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our services, and general economic conditions. If we cannot drive suitable cost efficiencies, our profit margins will suffer. Our cost efficiencies may also be impacted by factors such as our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new assignments, our ability to secure new business, our ability to forecast demand for our services (and, consequently, appropriately manage the size and location of our workforce), our ability to develop, attract and retain suitable capabilities and talent, our ability to obtain third party services at favorable prices, our ability to manage key suppliers to maximize delivery, product and efficiency opportunities, inflation (including wage inflation) and the need to devote time and resources to training and professional and business development.\nIn our investment businesses, we advise or act on behalf of clients regarding their investments. The results of these investments are uncertain and subject to numerous factors, some of which are within our control and some which are not. Clients that experience losses or lower than expected investment returns may leave us for competitors and/or assert claims against us.\nOur investment businesses provide advice to clients on: investment strategy, which can include advice on setting investment objectives, asset allocation, and hedging strategies; selection (or removal) of investment managers; the investment in different investment instruments and products; and the selection of other investment service providers such as custodians and transition managers. For some clients, we are responsible for making decisions on these matters and we may implement such decisions in a fiduciary or agency capacity without assuming title over the underlying funds or assets invested. Asset classes may experience poor absolute performance and third parties we recommend or select, such as investment managers, may underperform their benchmarks due to poor market performance, negligence, or other reasons, resulting in poor investment returns or losses. These losses may be attributable in whole or in part to alleged failures on our part or to events entirely outside of our control, including but not limited to uncertainty or volatility in financial markets due to economic, political, and regulatory conditions or pandemics. Plaintiffs have filed, and may continue to file, individual and class action lawsuits alleging investment consultants have charged excessive fees, given improper advice or taken investment actions due to conflicts of interest, or recommended investments that underperformed other investments available at the time. Defending against these claims can involve potentially significant costs, including legal defense costs, as well as cause substantial distraction, publicity and diversion of other resources. If any lawsuit – against the Company or any other investment consultant or asset manager – results in a large adverse verdict, the size of the verdict or resultant negative adverse publicity may prompt the filing of additional lawsuits. Furthermore, our ability to limit our potential liability is restricted in certain jurisdictions and in connection with claims involving breaches of fiduciary or agency duties or other alleged errors or omissions.\n14\nThe anticipated benefits of the redomiciliation from the U.K. to Ireland may not be realized.\nIn April 2020, we changed the jurisdiction of incorporation for our parent company from the U.K. to Ireland by means of a scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Ireland Reorganization”). At the time of the Ireland Reorganization we expected, and we continue to expect, that the Ireland Reorganization will, among other things, provide greater certainty around ongoing access to existing U.S. treaties with other E.U. member states from which we derive benefit. However, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the Ireland Reorganization, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nWe face exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates of currencies other than our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, as a significant portion of our business is located outside of the U.S. These exposures may change over time, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Approximately 55% of our consolidated revenue is non-U.S., attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, and where products are sold, and the exposures created can have significant currency volatility. These currency exchange fluctuations create risk in both the translation of the financial results of our global subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements, as well as in those of our operations that receive revenue and incur expenses other than in their respective local currencies, which can reduce the profitability of our operations based on the direction the respective currencies’ exchange rates move. A decrease in the value of certain currencies relative to other currencies could place us at a relative disadvantage compared to our competitors that benefit to a greater degree from a specific exchange rate move and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost or receive greater revenues from such a transaction. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against certain adverse foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and, as a result, changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results. For example, the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies might adversely affect the value of our products and services when translated to U.S. dollar, even if the value of such products and services has not changed in their original currency.\nChanges in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.\nOperating funds available for corporate use were $1,142 million at December 31, 2022 and are reported in Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. Of the total balance, $115 million was restricted to its use as of December 31, 2022. Funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $6.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and are reported in Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2022, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $60 million. Adverse changes in interest rates, performance, and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. We may experience reduced investment earnings on our cash and short-term investments of fiduciary and operating funds if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk fall below their current levels, or if negative yields on deposits or investments are experienced, as we have experienced in Japan and certain jurisdictions in the E.U. On the other hand, higher interest rates could result in a higher discount rate used by investors to value our future cash flows thereby resulting in a lower valuation of the Company. In addition, during times of stress in the banking industry, counterparty risk can quickly escalate, potentially resulting in substantial losses for us as a result of our cash or other investments with such counterparties, as well as substantial losses for our clients and the insurance companies with which we work.\nOur pension obligations and value of our pension assets could adversely affect our shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow, and liquidity.\nTo the extent that the pension obligations associated with our pension plans continue to exceed the fair value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, lower interest rates and investment returns could result in the present value of plan liabilities increasing at a greater rate than the value of plan assets, resulting in higher unfunded positions in our pension plans. In addition, the periodic revision of pension assumptions or variances of actual results from our assumptions can materially change the present value of expected future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting net periodic pension expense. As a result, we may experience future changes in the funded status of our plans that could require us to make additional cash contributions beyond those that have been estimated and which could adversely affect shareholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur worldwide pension plans are significant, and therefore our pension contributions and expense are sensitive to various market, demographic, and other factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, fair value of pension assets, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes or developments, and counterparty exposure from various investments and derivative contracts, including annuities. Variations or developments in connection with any of these factors could cause\n15\nsignificant changes to our financial position and results of operations from year to year. In addition, contributions are generally based on statutory requirements and local funding practices, which may differ from measurements under U.S. GAAP.\nWe have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately\n$10.8 billion\n. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility by reducing our ability to use cash from operations for other purposes, including working capital, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We also are subject to risks that, at the time any of our outstanding debt matures, we will not be able to retire or refinance the debt on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had two committed credit facilities outstanding. Each of these facilities is intended to support our commercial paper obligations and our general working capital needs. In addition, each of these facilities included customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, tested quarterly.\nA substantial portion of our outstanding debt, including certain intercompany debt obligations, contains financial and other covenants. The terms of these covenants may limit our ability to obtain, or increase the costs of obtaining, additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate requirements. This in turn may have the impact of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a relative disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness, or fewer or less onerous covenants associated with such indebtedness, and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to take such actions or refinance any of our debt, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nA decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs, access to capital, and financial flexibility.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs, reduce or eliminate our access to capital, reduce our financial flexibility, and limit our ability to implement our corporate strategy. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2022 were A- with a stable outlook (S&P), BBB+ with a stable outlook (Fitch), and Baa2 with a stable outlook (Moody’s). Our commercial paper ratings were A-2 (S&P), F-2 (Fitch) and P-2 (Moody’s).\nReal or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect any trading market for, or trading value of, our securities. Such changes could result from any number of factors, including the modification by a credit rating agency of the criteria or methodology it applies to particular issuers, a change in the agency’s view of us or our industry, or as a consequence of actions we take to implement our corporate strategies. A change in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and our competitive position.\nOur tax assets and liabilities are subject to a variety of different factors, which could create volatility in our global effective tax rate, expose us to greater than anticipated tax liabilities or cause us to adjust previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.\nWe are, and anticipate we will be, subject to income taxes in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S. and many other jurisdictions. As a result, our global effective tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation or regulations, the continuing development of regulations and other governmental action that affect the application of such legislation, our global mix of earnings, the use of global funding structures, the tax characteristics of our income, the effect of complying with transfer pricing requirements under laws of many different countries on our revenues and costs, the consequences of acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and business segments. In addition, we could be subject to increased taxation as a result of changes in eligibility for the benefits of current income tax treaties between and among Ireland, the U.K., the U.S and other countries, including any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between and among such countries, or any new statutory or regulatory provisions that might limit our ability to take advantage of any such treaties. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and our determination of the amount of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material.\n16\nThe overall tax environment in the jurisdictions in which we are or may be subject to taxes is highly uncertain and increasingly complex. Countries around the world are considering changes in their tax laws and regulations. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act introduced, among other changes, a 1% excise tax on certain stock redemptions by U.S. corporations (which the U.S. Treasury indicated may also apply to certain stock redemptions of foreign corporations deemed funded by their U.S. affiliates). The OECD, a global coalition of member countries, proposed a plan to reform international taxation which includes the introduction of a global minimum tax. The OECD recommendations have been nominally accepted by many countries within and without the OECD, but the implementation in each country remains subject to the possibility of significant variation, which could lead to a risk of multiple levels of taxation on Aon’s income. The U.K. and E.U. member states, among others, have introduced draft legislation or otherwise agreed to implement a global minimum tax that would be consistent with the OECD recommendations, beginning, for Aon, in 2024. There remains significant uncertainty as to if, when and how the various OECD proposals will ultimately be enacted. If and when effective, the global minimum tax could have a material adverse effect on our global effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are, and anticipate we will be, subject to tax audits conducted by Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and other tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other changes (such as those in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. The tax laws and regulations in Ireland, the U.K., the U.S., and the other tax jurisdictions in which we operate are inherently complex, and we will be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities, which could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or sanctions, which could be material.\nThere can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in tax laws and regulations, including any changes in the interpretation of such tax authorities, or from audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of such actions could cause our global effective tax rate to increase, our use of cash to increase and our financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nChanges in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating to revenue recognition, pensions, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments or changes in accounting principles or standards, and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates, or changes in assumptions, estimates, policies, or developments in the business may change our initial estimates, which could materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Financial Position, Shareholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows.\nWe may be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our share price or market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or other long- lived assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.\nThe Company is organized as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating entities. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We rely on dividends, interest, and other payments from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing ordinary shares, and corporate\n17\nexpenses. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate or other restrictions that may limit the amounts that subsidiaries can pay in dividends or other payments to us. No assurance can be given that there will not be further changes in law, regulatory actions, or other circumstances that could restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that our subsidiaries may be able to make timely payments to us in order for us to meet our obligations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to E&O claims against us as well as other contingencies and legal proceedings, some of which, if determined unfavorably to us, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe assist our clients with various matters, including advising on and placing insurance and reinsurance coverage and handling related claims, consulting on various human resources matters, and providing actuarial, investment consulting, and asset management services. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for damages arising from these services. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, or the failure to give error-free consulting or investment advice. It is not always possible to prevent and detect E&Os, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, we are subject to other types of claims, litigation, and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which along with E&O claims, may seek damages, including punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, earnings, and cash flows. In addition to potential liability for monetary damages, such claims or outcomes could harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.\nWe have historically purchased, and intend to continue to purchase, insurance to cover E&O claims and other insurance to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters and other matters related to our operations. However, we may be unable to maintain, at commercially reasonable rates, our current levels of insurance coverage for E&O claims or other risks in future periods. Also, we have exhausted or materially depleted our coverage under some of the policies that protect us for certain years and, consequently, are self-insured or materially self-insured for some historical claims. Additionally, parts or all of an E&O claim could fall within insurance deductibles, self-insured retentions, or policy exclusions. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant and may also be adversely affected by disputes we may have with our insurers over coverage. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in Other general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Discussion of some of these claims, lawsuits, and proceedings are contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, we provide a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to our customers and others. In the event of a default, our potential exposure is equal to the amount of the guarantee or indemnification.\nThe ultimate outcome of claims, lawsuits, proceedings, guarantees and indemnifications cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or subject us to legal and regulatory actions.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive legal and regulatory oversight throughout the world, including the Irish Companies Act, the U.S. securities laws, rules, and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated by the FCA and a variety of other laws, rules, and regulations addressing, among other things, licensing, privacy and data protection, trade sanctions laws, restrictions and export controls, anti-money laundering, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, antitrust and competition, anti-corruption, currency, reserves, government contracting, and the amount of local investment with respect to our operations in certain countries. This legal and regulatory oversight could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by: increasing the costs of legal and regulatory compliance; limiting or restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we serve or enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, the overall structure of our business units, the type of services and prices we can charge for our services, or the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers, and third parties; or by subjecting our businesses to the possibility of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings, or fines.\nThe global nature of our operations increases the complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations adding to our cost of doing business. In addition, many of these laws and regulations may have differing or conflicting legal standards across jurisdictions, increasing the complexity and cost of compliance. In emerging markets and other jurisdictions with less developed legal systems, local laws and regulations may not be established with sufficiently clear and reliable guidance to provide us adequate assurance that we are operating our business in a compliant manner with all required licenses or that our rights are otherwise protected. In addition, certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the\n18\nForeign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act in the U.S., and the Bribery Act of 2010 in the U.K., impact our operations outside of the legislating country by imposing requirements for the conduct of overseas operations, and in several cases, requiring compliance by foreign subsidiaries.\nIn addition to the complexity of the laws and regulations themselves, the development of new laws and regulations or changes in application or interpretation of current laws and regulations or conflict between them also increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity. Additionally, our acquisitions of new businesses and our continued operational changes and entry into new jurisdictions and new service offerings increases our legal and regulatory compliance complexity, as well as the type of governmental oversight to which we may be subject. Changes in laws and regulations could mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions, impose additional licensure requirements or costs to our operations and services, or cause us to cease offering certain services or solutions. Furthermore, as we enter new jurisdictions or businesses and further develop and expand our services, including through acquisitions, we may become subject to additional types of laws and governmental oversight and supervision, such as those applicable to the financial lending or other service institutions. Regulatory developments that could result in changes that adversely affect us or cause us to change our business or operations include: additional requirements respecting data privacy, data security, and data usage in jurisdictions in which we operate that may increase our costs of compliance and potentially reduce the manner in which we can use data; changes in tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; regulatory actions or changes that require us to change our compensation model; or additional regulations promulgated by , regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nGovernmental and public attention to climate change and environmental matters, including new or enhanced reporting, diligence or disclosure rules and regulations, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. These and other rapidly changing laws, rules and regulations, may increase the cost of our compliance and risk management and otherwise impact our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the shift toward a lower-carbon economy, driven by changes in laws, rules and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, consumer sentiment, and/or liability risks, may negatively impact our business model and/or the business models of our clients.\nIn addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other ESG topics, governments and other stakeholders may impose new rules or expectations causing a shift in disclosure and other behaviors that may negatively impact our business.\nIn all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew, and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may have a license revoked or be unable to obtain new licenses and therefore be precluded or suspended from carrying on or developing some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can further develop or continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction in the future as it has been conducted in the past. Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance.\nOur business’ regulatory oversight also includes licensing of insurance brokers and agents, managing general agency or general underwriting operations, and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance broking in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions, and our failure to adhere to these rules and regulations can expose us to fines or other sanctions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client.\nServices provided in our Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions businesses are also the subject of ever-evolving government regulation, either because the services provided to our clients are regulated directly or because third parties upon whom we rely to provide services to clients are regulated, thereby indirectly affecting the manner in which we provide services to those clients. In particular, our health care exchange business depends upon the private sector of the U.S. insurance system and its role in financing health care delivery, and insurance carriers’ use and payment of commissions to agents, brokers, and other organizations to market and sell individual and family health insurance products and plans. Uncertainty regarding, or any changes to, state or federal law, or the interpretation of such law by applicable regulatory agencies could delay client adoption of our health care exchanges, impair our ability to retain clients who have adopted our health care exchanges, or cause insurance carriers to alter or eliminate the products and plans that they offer or attempt to move members into new products or plans for which we receive lower commissions. In addition, changes in laws, government regulations, or the way those regulations are interpreted in the jurisdictions in which we operate could affect the viability, value, use, or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans (such as medical), defined\n19\ncontribution plans (such as 401(k)), or defined benefit plans (such as pension), may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services.\nIf we violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions and could be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate these laws and regulations, causing an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nHeightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny may lead to additional regulatory investigations, increased government involvement, or enforcement actions, which could consume significant management time and resources and could have adverse effects on our business and operations. For instance, increased scrutiny by competition authorities may increase our costs of doing business or force us to change the way we conduct business or refrain from or otherwise alter the way we engage in certain activities. Additionally,\nwe could suffer significant financial or reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, which exist or could exist any time we or any of our employees have or may have an interest in a transaction or engagement that is inconsistent with our clients’ interests. This could occur, for example, when we are providing services to multiple parties in connection with a transaction. We also provide services to advise and assist in satisfying all our clients’ needs from all our businesses, creating a greater potential for conflicts with advisory services.\nDue to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including, without limitation, situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client. If these are not adequately identified and managed, this could then lead to failure or perceived failure to protect the client’s interests, with consequential regulatory and reputational risks, including litigation or enforcement actions that could adversely affect us and our operations. Identifying conflicts of interest may also prove particularly difficult as we continue to bring systems and information together and integrate newly acquired businesses. In addition, we may not be able to adequately address such conflicts of interest.\nInsurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by base commissions paid by insurance carriers in respect of insurance placements for clients, or by fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain other revenue from insurance carriers. This revenue, when derived from carriers in their capacity as insurance markets (as opposed to as corporate clients of the intermediaries where they may be purchasing insurance or reinsurance or other non-market related services), is commonly known as MDI. MDI is another example of an area in which potential conflicts of interest may arise. This revenue may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, conduct and anti-bribery laws and regulations. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing consulting services to carriers. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny and our controls may not be fully effective.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our reputation, ability to compete effectively, and financial condition.\nTo protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, employees, clients, strategic partners, and others, as well as internal policies and procedures regarding our management of intellectual property. However, the protective steps that we take may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, we operate in many jurisdictions and effective trademark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available or adequate in every country or jurisdiction in which we offer our services or employ our colleagues. Additionally, our competitors may develop products similar to our products that do not conflict with our related intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.\nIn addition, to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages, and could limit our ability to use or offer certain technologies, products, or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive, take significant time and divert management’s attention from other business concerns. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n20\nOperational Risks\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected and could be materially adversely affected in the future by the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and the emergence of COVID-19 variants has created significant public health concerns and significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption in every region where we operate.\nA number of evolving factors related to the global pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery period may influence the duration, nature and extent of the impact on our business and financial results. Such factors include worldwide macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, employment rates, consumer confidence and spending, gross domestic product, property values, and changes in client behavior, and foreign exchange rates in each of the markets in which we operate; business closures; changes in laws, regulations (including those changes that may provide for extended premium payment terms), and guidance; court decisions and litigation trends; a decline in business and the ability of counterparties to pay for our services on time or at all; an increased number of E&O claims in those areas impacted by the pandemic, as well as an increase in the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us and our market partners; our ability to sell and provide our services, including due to the impact of travel restrictions, lockdowns, quarantines, social distancing, and alternative work arrangements; the health of, and the effect of the pandemic on, our employees; political disruption; potential effects on our internal controls and risk mitigation processes, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working environments for our employees and business partners; resurgences of spread; identification of new, more contagious variants of the virus; resulting “lockdowns,” government restrictions, mandates, requirements or recommendations; and uncertainties in vaccine adoption.\nIn addition, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics, may again create significant disruptions or volatility in the credit or financial markets, or impact our credit ratings, which could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all.\nFinally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other epidemics or pandemics may heighten other risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.\nThe economic and political conditions of the countries and regions in which we operate could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity, and prospects for growth.\nOur operations in countries undergoing political change or experiencing economic instability are subject to uncertainty and risks that could materially adversely affect our business. These risks include, particularly in emerging markets, the possibility we would be subject to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, unstable governments and economies, impacts from geopolitical conflicts, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods, services, and currency.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain, attract and develop experienced and qualified personnel, including our senior management team and other personnel.\nWe depend, in material part, upon the members of our senior management team who possess extensive knowledge and a deep understanding of our business and our strategy, as well as the colleagues who are critical to developing and retaining client relationships. The unexpected loss of services of any of these senior leaders could have a disruptive effect adversely impacting our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy. Additionally, competition for professional personnel remains intense, and we are constantly working to retain, attract and develop these professionals. If we cannot successfully do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may also become involved in disputes and litigation in connection with our efforts to retain and hire personnel, which can be disruptive to our business and may expose us to potential liability for monetary damages. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior management team and critical colleagues, if our succession plans and retention programs do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe strive to maintain an equitable work environment that unlocks the full potential of all of our personnel - this includes our commitment to diversity and inclusion, focus on colleague wellness and mental health, and building a flexible work environment that meets colleague and client needs. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining such a work environment or adapting to colleague needs or expectations, we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business.\n21\nOur global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are conducted globally. Accordingly, we are subject to regulatory, legal, economic, and market risks associated with global operations and sourcing, including:\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our offices, and overseeing joint venture operations and compliance in disparate jurisdictions, including due to unexpected inflation (including wage inflation) or job turnover, and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal and compliance costs and risks associated with multiple international locations;\n•\nhyperinflation in certain countries;\n•\nthe impacts of geopolitical conflicts;\n•\nconflicting regulations across the countries in which we do business;\n•\nimposition of investment requirements or other restrictions by governments in certain countries;\n•\nlonger payment cycles;\n•\ngreater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n•\ninsufficient demand for our services in certain jurisdictions;\n•\nour ability to execute effective and efficient cross-border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients;\n•\nthe reliance on or use of third parties to perform services on behalf of the Company;\n•\ndisparate tax regimes;\n•\nrestrictions on the import and export of technologies; and\n•\ntrade barriers.\nOur business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop, implement, update, and enhance solutions to support our business operations or if we are not able to effectively drive value for our clients.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance and implement the systems necessary to operate our businesses and to achieve intended efficiencies and improvements. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to rapid and continuing changes in technology, data and analytics, industry standards and client preferences. The effort to gain necessary expertise and achieve internal efficiencies through technology and data and analytics require us to incur significant expenses, and we may not be successful in identifying the optimal funding priorities. We make investments in technology and data and analytics to operate our businesses and achieve intended efficiencies; however, our investments and enhancements may not be sufficient to respond needs across all of our businesses. In addition, if we are not successful in developing and maintaining expertise in process excellence, technology and data trends, our business performance may be compromised.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business and increases in claims that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather, or other climate events; pandemic health events, and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, violence, military actions, and cyber-terrorism (including, but not limited to, ransomware). The continued threat of terrorism and other events or disasters may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger energy shortages, public health issues, or an economic downturn or instability in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. They could also result in reduced underwriting capacity, making it more difficult for our professionals to place business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations. If access to underwriting markets for certain lines of coverage becomes unavailable or difficult due to the impact of climate change on the claims environment, this may have a negative impact on our clients’ access to coverage, which could in turn reduce our ability to place certain lines of coverage and negatively impact our business.\nA natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us. Climate change may increase the likelihood or severity of a natural or man-made disaster.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our personnel, offices, and technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a security incident or attack, a natural disaster, climate\n22\nevent, terrorist attack, pandemic, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel and office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer systems, telecommunications, and other related systems and operations. In events like these, while our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems provide us with some degree of flexibility, we still can experience near-term operational challenges in particular areas of our operations. We could potentially lose access to key executives, personnel, or client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships, or legal liability.\nWe rely on third parties to perform key functions of our business operations enabling our provision of services to our clients. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide services, data, and information such as technology, information security, funds transfers, data processing, support functions, and administration that are critical to the operations of our business. These third parties include correspondents, agents and other brokerage and intermediaries, insurance markets, data providers, plan trustees, payroll service providers, benefits administrators, software and system vendors, business process outsourcing providers, health plan providers, investment managers, and providers of human resources, among others. As we do not fully control the actions of these third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions, actions, or inactions may adversely impact us and replacing these service providers could create significant delay and expense. Our failure to manage our key suppliers and our day-to-day operations with effective controls, and/or a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner, particularly during periods of our peak demand for their services, could result in economic, legal, and reputational harm to us. In addition, we face risks as we transition from in-house functions to third- party support functions and providers that there may be disruptions in service or other unintended results that may adversely affect our business operations. These third parties face their own technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause harm to our business and reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, cybersecurity or data privacy incidents (including, but not limited to, ransomware), capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or for any other reason could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients, or employees, damage to our reputation, and harm to our business.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with the handling of client funds.\nCertain of our businesses collect premiums from insureds and remits the premiums to the respective insurers. We also collect claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds, which are then remitted to the insureds. Consequently, at any given time, we may be holding and managing funds of our clients. This function creates a risk of loss arising from, among other things, fraud by employees or third parties, execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing, or other cybersecurity events or security breaches. We are also potentially at risk in the event the financial institution in which we hold these funds suffers any kind of insolvency or liquidity event. The occurrence of any of these types of events in connection with this function could cause us financial loss and reputational harm.\nIn connection with the implementation of our corporate strategies and initiatives, we face risks associated with, among others, the acquisition or disposition of businesses, the integration and development of acquired businesses, and the entry into new lines of business or products.\nIn pursuing our corporate strategy, we often acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own and we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, and negotiating possible transactions. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, secure regulatory approval of transactions where required, complete transactions and, in the case of acquisitions, successfully integrate them into our existing businesses and culture. If we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition targets, or if our competitors are more successful in identifying acquisition targets at favorable valuations, we may we fail to achieve desired strategic goals, capabilities and efficiencies, and our results of operations might be adversely affected. If a proposed transaction is not consummated, the time and resources spent pursuing it could adversely impact employees, clients and shareholders and the failure to consummate a proposed transaction could result in payment of termination fees and reimbursement of expenses, reputational harm, disputes and litigation and missed opportunities to locate and acquire other businesses. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including, but not limited to, revenue growth, operational efficiencies, or expected synergies, and we could incur unexpected costs in connection with integration. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will\n23\nnot incur certain disposition related charges, will not be subject to post-closing liabilities, obligations or restrictions, will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets, or will realize the intended benefits of the disposition.\nWe may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business either through acquisitions or through initiative to generate organic revenue growth. These new lines of business, products, and services present the Company with additional risks, particularly in instances where the markets are new or not fully developed. Such risks include the investment of significant time and resources; the possibility that these efforts will not be successful and could result in reputational damage to us; the possibility that the marketplace does not accept our products or services or that we are unable to retain clients that adopt our new products or services; and the risk of new or additional liabilities associated with these efforts, including potential E&O or other claims. In addition, many of the businesses that we acquire and develop will likely have significantly smaller scales of operations prior to the implementation of our growth strategy. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of these businesses, including improving, refining, or revising our systems and operational practices, and enlarging the scale and scope of the businesses, our business may be adversely affected. Other risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, product or service, integrating the acquired business into our systems and culture, recruiting and retaining experienced professionals, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. External factors, such as compliance with new or revised regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business, products, or services. Failure to manage these risks in the acquisition or development of new businesses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in connection with the sale of the Divested Business.\nOn May 1, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the benefits administration and business process outsourcing business (the “Divested Business) to an entity controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “Buyer”). This transaction carries inherent risks, including the risk that we will not earn the $500 million of additional consideration or otherwise realize the intended value of the transaction.\nRisks Related to Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data Protection\nWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption due to a breach in the security of our information technology systems could have a negative impact on our reputation, operations, sales, and operating results.\nWe rely on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, security breaches, and unauthorized access or improper actions by insiders or employees. We are at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through new and increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including methods that take advantage of remote work scenarios due to COVID-19. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures, or detect and respond quickly enough in the event of an incident or attack. We regularly experience social engineering attempts, and increasingly sophisticated attempted attacks to our systems and networks. Aon has from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems, ransomware incidents, data loss via malicious and non-malicious methods, and similar incidents, which to date have not had a material impact on our business. If we are unable to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade our system safeguards, we may incur unexpected costs and certain of our systems may become more vulnerable to unauthorized access. Problems with the information technology systems of vendors, including breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, difficulties in the migration of services or data to third parties or the cloud hosted by third parties, cyber-attacks, and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise conduct business. Additionally, we are a global and acquisitive organization and we therefore might not adequately identify weaknesses in certain of our information systems, including those of targets we acquire, which could expose us to unexpected liabilities and fines or make our own systems more vulnerable to attack. These types of incidents affecting us, our clients, insurance carriers, vendors, or other third-parties could result in intellectual property or other confidential information being lost or stolen, including client or employee personal information or company data.\nWe have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network security and disruptions, but a security breach or a significant or extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, adversely impact our operations, sales, and operating results, and require us to incur significant expense (in connection with incident response, remediation efforts, or otherwise) and divert resources to address and\n24\nremediate or otherwise resolve such issues. Additionally, in order to maintain the level of security, service, and reliability that our clients require, we may be required to make significant additional investments in our information technology system.\nImproper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or harm to our reputation.\nOne of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our employees’ and clients’ confidential and proprietary information, including confidential information about our clients’ and employees’ compensation, medical information, and other personally identifiable information. We maintain policies, procedures, and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we have experienced cyber incidents and cannot eliminate the risk of human error, employee or vendor malfeasance, or cyber-attacks that could result in improper access to or disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information. Such access or disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws and regulations that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs, fines, loss of revenue, and loss of clients. The release of confidential information as a result of a security breach could also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals or business partners, or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include penalties or fines, could have a significant negative impact on our business.\nIn many jurisdictions, including in the E.U. and the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of this information. These laws and regulations are frequently changing and are becoming increasingly complex and sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services both in terms of substance and in terms of enforceability. This makes compliance challenging and expensive. Additionally, certain jurisdictions’ regulations include notice provisions that may require us to inform affected clients or employees in the event of a breach of confidential information before we fully understand or appreciate the extent of the breach. These notice provisions present operational challenges and related risk. In particular, there have been a number of recently adopted privacy laws around the globe including in China and, Brazil, and significant privacy rulings in the E.U. relating to the “Schrems II” case, which imposed significant changes to the way companies export personal data from the E.U. We have had to implement new requirements set out in these laws within our business before the effective date causing distraction from other aspects of our business. This new guidance issued to firms by the European Regulators has and will continue to require significant time to implement and may require significant effort to review and effect applicable changes to IT systems and transfer methods. Non-compliance with new and existing laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and additional costs in connection therewith. We expect additional jurisdictions to continue to adopt new privacy regulations and there to be amendments to existing regulations as governments continue to legislate in respect of personal data. We have and will continue to incur expenses and devote resources to bring our practices into compliance with these regulations and future regulations. Our failure to comply with or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, result in proceedings or fines against us by governmental entities or others, or impair our reputation in the marketplace. Further, regulatory initiatives in the area of data protection are more frequently including provisions allowing authorities to impose substantial fines and penalties, and therefore, failure to comply could also have a significant financial impact.\nRisks Related to Being an Irish-incorporated Company\nWe are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nIt may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland, based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S.\n25\nIn addition, depending on the circumstances, the acquisition, ownership and/or disposition of our ordinary shares may subject shareholders to different or additional tax consequences under Irish law including, but not limited to, Irish stamp duty, dividend withholding tax and capital acquisitions tax.\nAs an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions regarding the Company will require the approval of shareholders, which may limit the Company’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.\nIrish law generally provides that a board of directors may allot and issue shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert into shares) if authorized to do so by a company’s constitution or by an ordinary resolution of shareholders. Such authorization may be granted in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another ordinary resolution. The Company’s constitution authorizes our directors to allot shares up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This authorization will need to be renewed by ordinary resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, an allotment authority may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of shares being sought or approved.\nIrish law also generally provides shareholders with statutory pre-emption rights when new shares are issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption rights to be dis-applied in a company’s constitution or by a special resolution of shareholders. Such dis-application of pre-emption rights may be given in respect of up to the entirety of a company’s authorized but unissued share capital and for a maximum period of five years, at which point it must be renewed by another special resolution. The Company’s constitution dis-applies statutory pre-emption rights up to the maximum of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital for a period of five years from March 31, 2020. This dis-application will need to be renewed by special resolution upon its expiration and at periodic intervals thereafter. Under Irish law, a dis-application of statutory pre-emption rights may be given for up to five years at each renewal, but governance considerations may result in renewals for shorter periods or in respect of less than the maximum permitted number of unissued shares being sought or approved.\nIrish law requires us to have available “distributable profits” to pay dividends to shareholders and generally to make share repurchases and redemptions.\nUnder Irish law, we may only pay dividends and, generally, make share repurchases and redemptions from distributable profits. Distributable profits may be created through the earnings of the Company or other methods (including certain intra-group reorganizations involving the capitalization of the Company’s un-distributable profits and their subsequent reduction). While it is our intention to maintain a sufficient level of distributable profits in order to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and make share repurchases, there is no assurance that the Company will maintain the necessary level of distributable profits to do so."

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nAon plc is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, health, and wealth solutions. Through our experience, global reach, and comprehensive analytics, we are better able to help clients meet rapidly changing, increasingly complex, and interconnected challenges. We are committed to accelerating innovation to address unmet and evolving client needs, so that our clients are better informed, better advised, and able to make better decisions to protect and grow their business. Management is focused on strengthening Aon and uniting the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.\nFinancial Results\nThe following is a summary of our 2022 financial results:\n•\nRevenue increased $286 million, or 2%, to $12.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting 6% organic revenue growth and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation a 1% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other.\n•\nOperating expenses decreased $1.3 billion, or 13%, to $8.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to the $1.0 billion payment made in connection with terminating the combination with WTW (the “Termination Fee”) and certain transaction costs incurred related to the termination in the prior year (together, the “Transaction Costs”) and a $373 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, investments in long-term growth, and a $58 million charge related to certain legal settlements reached.\n•\nOperating margin increased to 29.4% in 2022 from 17.1% in 2021. The increase was driven by a decrease in operating expenses as listed above and organic revenue growth of 6%.\n•\nDue to the factors set forth above, Net income was $2.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 102%, from 2021.\n•\nDiluted earnings per share increased 119% to $12.14 per share during the twelve months of 2022 compared to $5.55 per share for the prior year period.\n•\nCash flows provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 48%, from $2.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to the Transaction Costs paid in the prior year period, and strong operating income growth, partially offset by higher incentive compensation payments made in the current year following strong performance in 2021.\nWe focus on four key metrics not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that we communicate to shareholders: organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP metrics should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is our measure of performance against these four metrics for 2022:\n•\nOrganic revenue growth, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Organic Revenue Growth,” was 6% in 2022, compared to 9% organic growth in the prior year.\n•\nAdjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Operating Margin,” was 30.8% in 2022, compared to 30.1% in the prior year. The increase in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects 6% organic revenue growth and a higher fiduciary investment income, partially offset by increased expenses and investments in long-term growth.\n•\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share,” was $13.39 per share in 2022, an increase of $1.39 per share, or 12%, from $12.00 per share in 2021. The increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share primarily reflects strong operational performance and effective capital management, highlighted by $3.2 billion of share repurchase during 2022, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.\n•\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP measure defined under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Free Cash Flow,” was $3.0 billion in 2022, an increase of $978 million, or 48%, from $2.0 billion in 2021, reflecting an increase in Cash flows from operations, partially offset by a $59 million increase in capital expenditures.\n30\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE\nFor many companies, the management of ESG risks and opportunities has become increasingly important, and ESG-related challenges, such as extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions, cyber events, regulatory changes, ongoing public health impacts, and the increased focus on workforce resilience in highly varied work environments continue to create volatility and uncertainty for our clients. Aon offers a wide range of risk assessment, consulting and advisory solutions, many of which are significant parts of our core business offerings, designed to address and manage ESG issues for clients, and to enable our clients to create more sustainable value. We view ESG risks as presenting an important opportunity for Aon to work together as one firm to address client needs and improve our impact on ESG matters.\nREVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nSummary of Results\nOur consolidated results are as follow (in millions, except per share data):\n31\nConsolidated Results for 2022 Compared to 2021\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased $286 million, or 2%, to $12.5 billion in 2022, compared to $12.2 billion in 2021. The increase was driven by 6% organic revenue growth and a 1% favorable impact from fiduciary investment income, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 1% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and other.\nCommercial Risk Solutions\nrevenue increased $80 million, or 1%, to $6.7 billion in 2022, compared to $6.6 billion in 2021. Organic revenue growth was 6% in 2022, reflecting growth across every major geography, including double-digit growth in Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific, driven by strong net new business generation, retention, and management of the renewal book portfolio. U.S. retail brokerage was pressured primarily by Transaction Solutions, which declined due to lower external deal volume. Results also reflect strong growth globally in the affinity business across both consumer and business solutions, including growth in the travel and events practice and Digital Client Solutions. On average globally, exposures and pricing were modestly positive, resulting in modestly positive market impact.\nReinsurance Solutions\nrevenue increased $193 million, or 10%, to $2.2 billion in 2022, compared to $2.0 billion in 2021. Organic revenue growth was 8% in 2022 driven by strong net new business generation in treaty, as well as solid growth in facultative placements and the Strategy and Technology Group. In addition, market impact was modestly positive on results.\nHealth Solutions\nrevenue increased $70 million, or 3%, to $2.2 billion in 2022, compared to $2.2 billion in 2021. Organic revenue growth was 8% in 2022, reflecting growth globally in core health and benefits brokerage, driven by strong retention, net new business generation and management of the renewal book portfolio. Strength in health and benefits included growth in advisory work related to wellbeing and resilience. Results also reflect double-digit growth in Human Capital, driven by data and advisory solutions, and modest growth in Consumer Benefits Solutions.\nWealth Solutions\nrevenue decreased $59 million, or 4%, to $1.4 billion in 2022, compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and a 2% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures, and other. This decrease was offset by organic revenue growth of 3% in 2022 driven by high demand and project related work related to pension risk transfer and ongoing impacts of regulatory changes. In Investments, a decrease in AUM-based delegated investment management revenue due to equity market and interest rate movements was partially offset by higher advisory demand and project-related work.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits decreased $261 million, or 4%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $293 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation and a $245 million decrease in Transaction Costs, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth.\nInformation Technology\nInformation technology, which represents costs associated with supporting and maintaining our infrastructure, increased $32 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily driven by ongoing investments in Aon Business Services-enabled technology platforms and technology to drive long-term growth, partially offset by a $17 million decrease in Transaction Costs.\nPremises\nPremises, which represents the cost of occupying offices in various locations throughout the world, decreased $38 million, or 12%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $22 million decrease in Transaction Costs and a $19 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.\nDepreciation of Fixed Assets\nDepreciation of fixed assets primarily relates to software, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, computer equipment, buildings, and automobiles. Depreciation of fixed assets decreased $28 million, or 16%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $16 million decrease in Transaction Costs.\nAmortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets\nAmortization and impairment of intangibles primarily relates to finite-lived customer-related and contract-based, technology, and tradename assets. Amortization and impairment of intangibles decreased $34 million, or 23%, in 2022 compared to 2021.\n32\nOther General Expenses\nOther general expenses decreased $964 million, or 43%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a $1.1 billion decrease in Transaction Costs, partially offset by an increase in expense associated with 6% organic revenue growth, including travel and entertainment expense, and a $58 million charge from certain legal settlements reach in 2022.\nInterest Income\nInterest income represents income earned on operating cash balances and other income-producing investments. It does not include interest earned on Funds held on behalf of clients. Interest income was $18 million in 2022, an increase of $7 million, or 64%, from 2021.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense, which represents the cost of our debt obligations, was $406 million in 2022, an increase of $84 million, or 26%, from 2021. The increase primarily reflects an increase in total debt.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther expense was $125 million in 2022, which primarily reflects a non-cash pension settlement charge of $170 million incurred in the fourth quarter, compared to Other income of $152 million in 2021, primarily reflecting a gain from sale of  businesses in the prior year period.\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes was $3.2 billion in 2022, a 63% increase from $1.9 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by $1.4 billion in Transaction Costs in the prior year period and strong operational performance.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate on net income was 16.2% in 2022 and 32.3% in 2021. The 2022 tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical distribution of income and certain discrete items, primarily the favorable impacts of share-based payments.\nThe 2021 tax rate was primarily driven by the impact of the Termination Fee, the U.K. statutory tax rate increase, and the tax benefit of share-based payments. The U.K. enacted legislation in the second quarter of 2021 which increases the corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% with effect from April 1, 2023 and the Company remeasured its U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.\nNet Income Attributable to Aon Shareholders\nNet income attributable to Aon shareholders increased to $2.6 billion, or $12.14 per diluted share, in 2022, compared to $1.3 billion, or $5.55 per diluted share, in 2021.\nConsolidated Results for 2021 Compared to 2020\nWe have elected not to include a discussion of our consolidated results for 2021 compared to 2020 in this report in reliance upon Instruction 1 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K. This discussion can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022.\nNon-GAAP Metrics\nIn our discussion of consolidated results, we sometimes refer to certain non-GAAP supplemental information derived from consolidated financial information specifically related to organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income attributable to Aon shareholders, adjusted net income per share, other income (expense), as adjusted, adjusted effective tax rate, free cash flow, and the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operating results. Management believes that these measures are important to make meaningful period-to-period comparisons and that this supplemental information is helpful to investors. Management also uses these measures to assess operating performance and performance for compensation. This non-GAAP supplemental information should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n33\nOrganic Revenue Growth\nWe use supplemental information related to organic revenue growth to help us and our investors evaluate business growth from existing operations. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP measure that includes the impact of certain intercompany activity and excludes the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges. This supplemental information related to organic revenue growth represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements. Industry peers provide similar supplemental information about their revenue performance, although they may not make identical adjustments. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the reported Total revenue is as follows (in millions, except percentages):\n(1)\nCurrency impact is determined by translating last year’s revenue at this year’s foreign exchange rates.\n(2)\nFiduciary investment income for the years ended December 31, 2022 2021, and 2020 was $76 million, $8 million, and $27 million, respectively.\n(3)\nOrganic revenue growth includes the impact of certain intercompany activity,\nchanges in foreign exchange rates, fiduciary investment income, acquisitions, divestitures, transfers between revenue lines, and gains or losses on derivatives accounted for as hedges.\n34\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nWe use adjusted operating margin as a non-GAAP measure of core operating performance of the Company. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses reflect our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted operating margin represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported operating margins is as follows (in millions, except percentages):\n(1)\nAs part of the terminated combination with WTW, certain transaction costs were incurred by the Company through the third quarter of 2021. These costs included advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees related to the combination, including planned divestitures, some of which were terminated, as well as certain compensation expenses and expenses related to further steps on our Aon United operating model as a result of the termination. Additionally, this includes the $1 billion Termination Fee paid in connection with the termination of the combination.\n(2)\nIn connection with certain legal settlements reached, a $58 million charge was recognized in the second quarter of 2022.\n35\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share\nWe use adjusted diluted earnings per share as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of certain items, as listed below, because management does not believe these expenses are the best indicators of our core operating performance. This supplemental information related to adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nA reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to reported diluted earnings per share is as follows (in millions, except per share data and percentages):\n(1)\nTo further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. A non-cash settlement charge totaling $170 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022 which is excluded from Adjusted Other income (expense).\n(2)\nAdjusted items are generally taxed at the estimated annual effective tax rate, except for the applicable tax impact associated with certain transaction costs and other charges related to the combination and resulting termination, as well as certain legal and pension settlements, which are adjusted at the related jurisdictional rate. In addition, income tax expense for the year ended December 30, 2021 excludes the impact of remeasuring the net deferred tax liabilities in the U.K. as a result of the corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the second quarter of 2021.\n(3)\nAdjusted Other income (expense) excludes gains from dispositions of $124 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n36\nFree Cash Flow\nWe use free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations minus capital expenditures, as a non-GAAP measure of our core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. This supplemental information related to free cash flow represents a measure not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, not instead of, the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of this non-GAAP measure does not imply or represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to cash flow provided by operations is as follows (in millions):\nImpact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations\nBecause we conduct business in more than 120 countries and sovereignties, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on our business. Foreign currency exchange rate movements may be significant and may distort true period-to-period comparisons of changes in revenue or pretax income. Therefore, to give financial statement users meaningful information about our operations, we have provided an illustration of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results. The methodology used to calculate this impact isolates the impact of the change in currencies between periods by translating the prior year’s revenue, expenses, and net income using the current year’s foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of\n$0.33\non earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2022 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $0.17 on earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2021, if 2020 results were translated at 2021 rates.\nCurrency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of\n$0.44\non adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2022 if prior year period results were translated at current period foreign exchange rates. Currency fluctuations had a favorable impact of $0.23 on adjusted earnings per diluted share during the year ended December 31, 2021, if 2020 results were translated at 2021 rates. These translations are performed for comparative and illustrative purposes only and do not impact the accounting policies or practices for amounts included in our Financial Statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity\nExecutive Summary\nWe believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with adequate liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity in the near-term include cash flows provided by operations and available cash reserves; primary sources of liquidity in the long-term include cash flows provided by operations, debt capacity available under our credit facilities, and capital markets. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and investments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, pension obligations, and shareholder dividends. We believe that cash flows from operations, available credit facilities, available cash reserves, and the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including principal and interest payments on debt obligations, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and anticipated working capital requirements in the next twelve months and over the long-term.\nCash on our balance sheet includes funds available for general corporate purposes, as well as amounts restricted as to their use. Funds held on behalf of clients in a fiduciary capacity are segregated and shown together with uncollected insurance premiums and claims in Fiduciary assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding amount in Fiduciary liabilities.\nIn our capacity as an insurance broker or agent, we collect premiums from insureds and, after deducting our commission, remit the premiums to the respective insurance underwriters. We also collect claims or refunds from underwriters on behalf of insureds, which are then returned to the insureds. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held by us in a fiduciary capacity. The levels of funds held on behalf of clients and liabilities can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect the premiums, claims, and refunds, make payments to underwriters and insureds, and collect funds from clients and make\n37\npayments on their behalf, and upon the impact of foreign currency movements. Funds held on behalf of clients, because of their nature, are generally invested in very liquid securities with highly rated, credit-worthy financial institutions. Fiduciary assets include funds held on behalf of clients comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $6.4 billion and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and fiduciary receivables of $9.5 billion and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. While we earn investment income on the funds held in cash and money market funds, the funds cannot be used for general corporate purposes.\nWe maintain multi-currency cash pools with third-party banks in which various Aon entities participate. Individual Aon entities are permitted to overdraw on their individual accounts provided the overall global balance does not fall below zero. At December 31, 2022, non-U.S. cash balances of one or more entities may have been negative; however, the overall balance was positive.\nThe following table summarizes our Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\nCash and cash equivalents and funds held on behalf of clients increased $431 million in 2022 compared to 2021. A summary of our cash flows provided by and used for operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows (in millions):\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $1,037 million, or 48%, from the prior year to $3,219 million. This amount represents Net income reported, generally adjusted for the following primary drivers including gains from sales of businesses, losses from sales of businesses, share-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, amortization and impairments, and other non-cash income and expenses, including pension settlement charges. Adjustments also include changes in working capital that relate primarily to the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and collection of receivables.\nPension Contributions\nPension contributions were $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $87 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $61 million in cash to our pension plans, including contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, which are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 were $449 million, a decrease of $498 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows used for investing activities are acquisition of businesses, purchases of short-term investments, capital expenditures, and payments for investments. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flows provided by investing activities are sales of businesses, sales of short-term investments, and proceeds from investments. The gains and losses corresponding to cash flows provided by proceeds from investments and used for payments for investments are primarily recognized in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n38\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments increased $160 million at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. As disclosed in Note 14 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report, the majority of our investments carried at fair value are money market funds. These money market funds are held throughout the world with various financial institutions. We are not aware of any market liquidity issues that would materially impact the fair value of these investments.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses\nDuring 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of five businesses for consideration of $162 million, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients, and the disposition of three businesses for a $81 million cash inflow, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients.\nDuring 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses for consideration of $14 million, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients, and the disposition of six business for a $218 million cash inflow, net of cash and funds held on behalf of clients.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company’s additions to fixed assets, including capitalized software, which amounted to $196 million in 2022 and $137 million in 2021, primarily related to refurbishing and modernizing of office facilities, software development costs, and computer equipment purchases.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used for financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,790 million, a decrease of $134 million compared to prior year. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flow used for financing activities are repayments of debt, share repurchases, dividends paid to shareholders, cash paid for employee taxes on withholding shares, transactions with noncontrolling interests, and other financing activities, such as collection of or payments for deferred consideration in connection with prior year business acquisitions and divestitures. Generally, the primary drivers of cash flow provided by financing activities are issuances of debt, changes in net fiduciary liabilities, and proceeds from issuance of shares.\nShare Repurchase Program\nWe have a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases, and was increased by $5.0 billion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020, and by $7.5 billion in February 2022 for a total of $27.5 billion in repurchase authorizations.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s Share Repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data):\nAt December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchase under the Repurchase Program was approximately $6.0 billion. Under the Repurchase Program, we have repurchased a total of 160.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $21.5 billion.\nBorrowings\nTotal debt at December 31, 2022 was $10.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion compared to December 31, 2021.\nIn November 2022, Aon Global Limited’s $350 million 4.00% Senior Notes due November 2023 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year as of December 31, 2022.\n39\nIn November 2022, Aon Corporation’s $500 million 2.20% Senior Notes matured and were repaid in full. In November 2021, the Company’s $500 million 2.20% Senior Notes due November 2022 were classified as Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as the date of maturity is in less than one year as of December 31, 2021.\nOn September 12, 2022, Aon Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Aon Global Holdings plc, a public limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, co-issued $500 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due September 2032. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\nOn February 28, 2022, Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc co-issued $600 million of 2.85% Senior Notes due May 2027 and $900 million of 3.90% Senior Notes due February 2052. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\nOn December 2, 2021, Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc co-issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.60% Senior Notes due December 2031. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.\nOn August 23, 2021, Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc co-issued $400 million of 2.05% Senior Notes due August 2031 and $600 million of 2.90% Senior Notes due August 2051. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 13, 2021, Aon Global Limited issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to holders of its 2.80% Senior Notes for the redemption of all $400 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes, which were set to mature in March 2021. The redemption date was on February 16, 2021 and resulted in an insignificant loss due to extinguishment.\nAon Corporation has established a U.S. commercial paper program (the “U.S. Program”) and Aon Global Holdings plc has established a European multi-currency commercial paper program (the “European Program” and, together with the U.S. Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”). Commercial paper may be issued in aggregate principal amounts of up to $1 billion under the U.S. Program and €625 million under the European Program, not to exceed the amount of our committed credit facilities, which was approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The aggregate capacity of the Commercial Paper Program remains fully backed by our committed credit facilities. Commercial paper activity during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):\n(1)   The proceeds of the commercial paper issuances were used primarily for short-term working capital needs.\n(2)   Proceeds from commercial paper issued by Aon Corporation under the U.S. Program, where the aggregate principal was raised on July 26, 2021, were used to pay approximately $400 million of the Termination Fee on July 27, 2021.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nDistributable Profits\nWe are required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g. Accumulated deficit). As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had distributable profits in excess of $29.0 billion and $32.7 billion, respectively. We believe that we will have sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future.\nCredit Facilities\nWe expect cash generated by operations for 2022 to be sufficient to service our debt and contractual obligations, finance capital expenditures, and continue to pay dividends to our shareholders. Although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these activities, we have the ability to access the commercial paper markets or borrow under our credit facilities to accommodate any timing differences in cash flows. Additionally, under current market conditions, we believe that we could access capital markets to obtain debt financing for longer-term funding, if needed.\n40\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had two primary committed credit facilities outstanding: our $1.0 billion multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in September 2026 and our $750 million multi-currency U.S. credit facility expiring in October 2024. In aggregate, these two facilities provide approximately $1.8 billion in available credit.\nEach of these primary committed credit facilities includes customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of adjusted consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense and consolidated debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA, tested quarterly. At December 31, 2022, we did not have borrowings under either facility, and we were in compliance with the financial covenants and all other covenants contained therein during the rolling year ended December 31, 2022.\nShelf Registration Statement\nOn May 12, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, registering the offer and sale from time to time of an indeterminate amount of, among other securities, debt securities, preference shares, class A ordinary shares and convertible securities. Our ability to access the market as a source of liquidity is dependent on investor demand, market conditions, and other factors.\nRating Agency Ratings\nThe major rating agencies’ ratings of our debt at February 17, 2023 appear in the table below.\nLetters of Credit and Other Guarantees\nWe have entered into a number of arrangements whereby our performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of a LOC. We had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $74 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $75 million at December 31, 2021. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of our U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for our own workers’ compensation program. We also have obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at our international subsidiaries.\nWe have certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately $173 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $153 million at December 31, 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2022 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and purchase obligations.\nOperating leases are primarily comprised of leased office space throughout the world. As leases expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. In certain circumstances, we may have unused space and may seek to sublet such space to third parties, depending upon the demands for office space in the locations involved. Refer to Note 8 “Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information.\nPension and other postretirement benefit plan obligations include estimates of our minimum funding requirements pursuant to the ERISA and other regulations, as well as minimum funding requirements agreed with the trustees of our U.K. pension plans. Additional amounts may be agreed to with, or required by, the U.K. pension plan trustees. Nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are based on estimated future benefit payments. We may make additional discretionary contributions. Refer to Note 11 “Employee Benefits” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information.\nPurchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us, and that specifies all significant terms, including the goods to be purchased or services to be rendered, the price at which the goods or services are to be rendered, and the timing of the transactions. Most of our purchase obligations are related to purchases of information technology services or other service contracts.\n41\nWe had no other cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nGuarantee of Registered Securities\nIn connection with the Ireland Reorganization, Aon plc and Aon Global Holdings plc, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, entered into various agreements pursuant to which they agreed to guarantee the obligations of Aon Corporation arising under issued and outstanding debt securities, which were previously guaranteed solely by Aon Global Limited and the obligations of Aon Global Limited arising under issued and outstanding debt securities, which were previously guaranteed solely by Aon Corporation. Those agreements include: (1) Second Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, and Aon Global Holdings plc and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”) (amending and restating the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 2, 2012, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee); (2) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated December 12, 2012, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited plc and the Trustee); (3) Second Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated May 20, 2015, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee); (4) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated November 13, 2015, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee); and (5) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated December 3, 2018, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee).\nAfter the Ireland Reorganization, newly issued and outstanding debt securities by Aon Corporation are guaranteed by Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, and Aon Global Holdings plc, and include the following (collectively, the “Aon Corporation Notes”):\nAll guarantees of Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, and Aon Global Holdings plc of the Aon Corporation Notes are joint and several as well as full and unconditional. Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all other present and future unsecured debt which is not expressed to be subordinate or junior in rank to any other unsecured debt of the company. There are no subsidiaries other than those listed above that guarantee the Aon Corporation Notes.\nAfter the Ireland Reorganization, newly issued and outstanding debt securities by Aon Global Limited are guaranteed by Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc, and Aon Corporation, and include the following (collectively, the “Aon Global Limited Notes”):\nAll guarantees of Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc, and Aon Corporation of the Aon Global Limited Notes are joint and several as well as full and unconditional.

There are no subsidiaries other than those listed above that guarantee the Aon Global Limited Notes.\nNewly co-issued and outstanding debt securities by Aon Corporation and Aon Global Holdings plc (together, the “Co-Issuers”) are guaranteed by Aon plc and Aon Global Limited and include the following (collectively, the “Co-Issued Notes”):\nAll guarantees of Aon plc and Aon Global Limited of the Co-Issued Notes are joint and several as well as full and unconditional. Senior Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all other present and future unsecured debt which is not expressed to be subordinate or junior in rank to any other unsecured debt of the Co-Issuers. There are no subsidiaries other than those listed above that guarantee the Co-Issued Notes.\nAon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, and Aon Global Holdings plc are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Aon plc. Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, Aon Global Holdings plc, and Aon Corporation together comprise the “Obligor group”. The following tables set forth summarized financial information for the Obligor group.\nAdjustments are made to the tables to eliminate intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group. Intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group and non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented as separate line items within the summarized financial information. These balances are presented on a net presentation basis, rather than a gross basis, as this better reflects the nature of the intercompany positions and presents the funding or funded position that is to be received or owed. No balances or transactions of non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented in the summarized financial information, including investments of the Obligor group in non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nSummarized Statement of Income information for the Obligor group is as follows (in millions):\n43\nSummarized Statement of Financial Position information for the Obligor group is as follows (in millions):\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. To prepare these financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect what we report as our assets and liabilities, what we disclose as contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.\nIn accordance with our policies, we regularly evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, those concerning revenue recognition, pensions, goodwill and other intangible assets, contingencies, share-based payments, and income taxes, and base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on our historical experience and on factors we believe reasonable under the circumstances. The results involve judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources. If our assumptions or conditions change, the actual results we report may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments we use to prepare these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.\nCosts incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.\nCommercial Risk Solutions\nincludes retail brokerage, specialty solutions, global risk consulting and captives management, and Affinity programs. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services\n44\nto customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period.\nReinsurance Solutions\nincludes treaty reinsurance, facultative reinsurance, Strategy and Technology Group, and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly for treaty reinsurance arrangements, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums.\nHealth Solutions\nincludes consulting and brokerage, Human Capital, and Consumer Benefits Solutions. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For Human Capital, revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time upon completion of the services. For arrangements recognized over time, revenue is based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, including units delivered or time elapsed. Input and output measures utilized vary based on the arrangement but typically include reports provided or days elapsed. Revenue from Consumer Benefits Solutions arrangements are typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.\nWealth Solutions\nincludes retirement consulting, pension administration and investments. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Revenue generated from our delegated investment business is generally earned as an agreed percentage based on AUM and, to a lesser extent, based on performance fees. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.\nPensions\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world. Our most significant plans are located in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, and Canada, which are closed to new entrants. We have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and services for our U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plans to the extent statutorily permitted.\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense). We used a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for our major pension and other postretirement benefit plans; this was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\n45\nRecognition of Gains and Losses and Prior Service\nCertain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets, which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, actual demographic experience, and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income. Such changes are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost.\nUnrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in Other comprehensive income, as previously described, are amortized into expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada plan members. We amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor, which is defined as 10% of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or PBO. To the extent not offset by future gains, incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized.\nThe following table discloses our accumulated other comprehensive loss, the number of years over which we are amortizing the loss, and the estimated 2023 amortization of loss by country (in millions, except amortization period):\nThe U.S. had no unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2022. The unrecognized prior service cost (credit) at December 31, 2022 was $35 million, and $(6) million for the U.K. and other plans, respectively.\nFor the U.S. pension plans, we use a market-related valuation of assets approach to determine the expected return on assets, which is a component of net periodic benefit cost recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. This approach recognizes 20% of any gains or losses in the current year’s value of market-related assets, with the remaining 80% spread over the next four years. As this approach recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value of assets and therefore, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. As of December 31, 2022, the market-related value of assets was $1.8 billion. We do not use the market-related valuation approach to determine the funded status of the U.S. plans recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Instead, we record and present the funded status in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position based on the fair value of the plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of plan assets was $1.5 billion. Our non-U.S. plans use fair value to determine expected return on assets.\nRate of Return on Plan Assets and Asset Allocation\nThe following table summarizes the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for future pension expense as of December 31, 2022:\nIn determining the expected rate of return for the plan assets, we analyze investment community forecasts and current market conditions to develop expected returns for each of the asset classes used by the plans. In particular, we surveyed multiple third-party financial institutions and consultants to obtain long-term expected returns on each asset class, considered historical performance data by asset class over long periods, and weighted the expected returns for each asset class by target asset allocations of the plans.\nThe U.S. pension plan asset allocation is based on approved allocations following adopted investment guidelines. The investment policy for U.K. and other non-U.S. pension plans is generally determined by the plans’ trustees. Because there are several pension plans maintained in the U.K. and other non-U.S. categories, our target allocation presents a range of the target allocation of each plan. Target allocations are subject to change.\n46\nImpact of Changing Economic Assumptions\nChanges in the discount rate and expected return on assets can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our PBO at December 31, 2022 (in millions):\n(1)\nIncreases to the PBO reflect increases to our pension obligations, while decreases in the PBO are recoveries toward fully-funded status. A change in the discount rate has an inverse relationship to the PBO.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our discount rate would have on our estimated 2023 pension expense (in millions):\nHolding all other assumptions constant, the following table reflects what a 25 BPS increase and decrease in our long-term rate of return on plan assets would have on our estimated 2023 pension expense (in millions):\nEstimated Future Contributions\nWe estimate cash contributions of approximately $61 million to our pension plans in 2023 as compared with cash contributions of $59 million in 2022.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired. We classify our intangible assets acquired as either customer-related and contract-based, technology, tradenames or other intangibles.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter. We test more frequently if there are indicators of impairment or whenever business circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. These indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, among others.\nWe perform impairment reviews at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. An operating segment shall be deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components are a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. We aggregate components of any operating segments that have similar economic characteristics into a single reporting unit.\n47\nWhen evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test becomes a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWhen determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use a DCF model based on our most current forecasts. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts and selection of the discount rate for use in the DCF model involve significant judgments, and changes in these estimates could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. We also use market multiples which are obtained from quoted prices of comparable companies to corroborate our DCF model results. The combined estimated fair value of our reporting units from our DCF model often results in a premium over our market capitalization, commonly referred to as a control premium. We believe the implied control premium determined by our impairment analysis is reasonable based upon historic data of premiums paid on actual transactions within our industry.\nWe review intangible assets that are being amortized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that an asset group’s carrying value may not be recoverable. If we are required to record impairment charges in the future, they could materially impact our results of operations\n.\nContingencies\nWe define a contingency as an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty as to a possible gain or loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to establish reserves for loss contingencies when the loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate its financial impact. We are required to assess the likelihood of material adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as potential ranges or probability of losses. We determine the amount of reserves required, if any, for contingencies after carefully analyzing each individual item. The required reserves may change due to new developments in each issue. We do not recognize gain contingencies until all contingencies are resolved.\nShare-Based Payments\nShare-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period for awards that we ultimately expect to vest. For purposes of measuring share-based compensation expense, we consider whether an adjustment to the observable market price is necessary to reflect material nonpublic information that is known to us at the time the award is granted. No adjustments were necessary for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. We also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant based on our actual experience to date and revise our estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nRestricted Share Units\nRSUs are service-based awards for which we recognize the associated compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period where applicable.\nPerformance Share Awards\nPSAs are performance-based awards for which vesting is dependent on the achievement of certain objectives. Such objectives may be made on a personal, group or company level. We estimate the fair value of the awards based on the market price of the underlying share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period.\nCompensation expense is recognized over the performance period. The number of shares issued on the vesting date will vary depending on the actual performance objectives achieved, which are based on a fixed number of potential outcomes. We make assessments of future performance using subjective estimates, such as long-term plans. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense recognized.\nThe largest plan is the LPP, which has a three-year performance period. As the percent of expected performance increases or decreases, the potential change in expense can go from 0% to 200% of the targeted total expense. The 2020 to 2022 performance period ended on December 31, 2022, the 2019 to 2021 performance period ended on December 31, 2021, and the 2018 to 2020 performance period ended on December 31, 2020. The LPP currently has two open performance periods: 2021 to\n48\n2023 and 2022 to 2024. A 10% upward adjustment in our estimated performance achievement percentage for both open performance periods would have increased our 2022 expense by approximately $2.6 million, while a 10% downward adjustment would have decreased our expense by approximately $7.7 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe earn income in numerous countries and this income is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries.\nThe carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies and are based on management’s assumptions and estimates about future operating results and levels of taxable income, and judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of current accounting principles.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in various factors.\nWe assess carryforwards and tax credits for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a “more likely than not” determination.\nWe base the carrying values of liabilities and assets for income taxes currently payable and receivable on management’s interpretation of applicable tax laws and incorporate management’s assumptions and judgments about using tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. Using different estimates, assumptions, and judgments in accounting for income taxes, especially those that deploy tax planning strategies, may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and changes in our results of operations.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nNote 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, including a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their impact or future potential impact on our financial results, if determinable."

    "text": "We are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair values of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. Refer to Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe are subject to foreign exchange rate risk. Our primary exposures include exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, and the Japanese yen. We use over-the-counter options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency risk to our financial statements.\nAdditionally, some of our non-U.S. brokerage subsidiaries receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiaries earn a portion of their revenue in U.S. dollars, euro, and Japanese yen, but most of their expenses are incurred in British pounds. At December 31, 2022, we have hedged approximately 45% of our U.K. subsidiaries’ expected exposures to the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen transactions for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2024. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.\nWe also use forward and option contracts to economically hedge foreign exchange risk associated with monetary balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany notes and current assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency and are subject to remeasurement.\nThe potential loss in future earnings from foreign exchange derivative instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would be $19 million and $9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n49\nThe translated value of revenues and expenses from our international brokerage operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were to translate prior year results at current year exchange rates, diluted earnings per share would have an unfavorable $0.33 impact during the year ended December 31, 2022. Further, adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure as defined and reconciled under the caption “Review of Consolidated Results — Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share,” would have an unfavorable $0.44 impact during the year ended December 31, 2022 if we were to translate prior year results at current quarter exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur fiduciary investment income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and, as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and in continental Europe. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel decrease in the year-end yield curve of 100 BPS would cause a decrease, net of derivative positions, of $67 million to each of 2023 and 2024 pretax income. A corresponding increase in the year-end yield curve of 100 BPS would cause an increase, net of derivative positions, of $67 million to each of 2023 and 2024 pre-tax income.\nWe have long-term debt outstanding, excluding the current portion, with a fair market value of\n$8.7 billion\nand $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value was less than the carrying value by\n$1.1 billion\nat December 31, 2022, and $0.9 billion greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2021. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value by a decrease of 7% or an increase of 8%, respectively, at December 31, 2022.\nWe have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events.\n50"

    "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Aon plc\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Aon plc (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principle\ns.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates\n.\n51\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1986.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 17, 2023\n52\nAon plc\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n53\nAon plc\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n54\nAon plc\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n55\nAon plc\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nAon plc\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Aon plc and all of its controlled subsidiaries (“Aon” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Consolidated Financial Statements include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for all periods presented.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of reserves and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Management believes its estimates to be reasonable given the current facts available. Aon adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency exchange rate movements increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment would, if applicable, be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts in prior periods' Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In prior periods, commercial paper issuances and repayments were included in Issuance of debt and Repayment of debt, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The net amount of commercial paper activity is now disclosed separately in Commercial paper issuances, net of repayments in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, commercial paper issuances reclassified from Issuance of debt was $\n4,478\nmillion and $\n3,162\nmillion, respectively, and commercial paper repayments reclassified from Repayment of debt was $\n3,807\nmillion and $\n3,275\nmillion, respectively. Further information on the gross commercial paper activity for the current and prior year periods is included within the Liquidity and Financial Conditions section of Part II Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn November 2022, Aon incurred a non-cash pension settlement charge of $\n170\nmillion in connection with the purchase of an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans. Aon has separately classified the non-cash pension settlement charge within Other, net on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as an adjustment to reconcile Net income to Cash provided by operating activities for the period ended December 31, 2022. Prior year comparable balances have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Aon incurred insignificant non-cash pension settlement charges of $\n5\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion, respectively, which were presented as changes in assets and liabilities held within Pension, other postretirement and other postemployment liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 11 “Employee Benefits” for further information regarding the non-cash settlement charges incurred.\nIn prior periods, Cash paid for employee taxes on withholding shares were included with Proceeds from issuance of shares, and presented as Issuance of shares for employee benefit plans in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These items are now presented separately and prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Proceeds from issuance of shares was $\n55\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion, respectively, and Cash paid for employee taxes on withholding shares was $\n185\nmillion and $\n193\nmillion, respectively.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Principles and Practices\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenues primarily through commissions, compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services provided to them, and fees from customers. Commissions and fees for brokerage services vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services provided to a client, insurer, or reinsurer, and the capacity in which the Company acts. Compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies includes: (1) fees for consulting and analytics services and (2) fees and commissions for administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers. In Aon’s capacity as an insurance and reinsurance broker, the service promised to the customer is placement of an effective insurance or reinsurance policy, respectively. The customer\n58\nobtains control over the services promised by the Company at the completion of the insurance or reinsurance policy placement process once coverage is effective. Judgment is not typically required when assessing whether the coverage is effective. Fees from clients for advice and consulting services are dependent on the extent and value of the services provided. Payment terms for the Company’s principal service lines are discussed below; the Company believes these terms are consistent with current industry practices. Significant financing components are typically not present in Aon’s arrangements.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to the customer in the amount that best reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements where control is transferred over time, an input or output method is applied that represents a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For arrangements that include variable consideration, the Company assesses whether any amounts should be constrained. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates consideration based on their relative fair values.\nCosts incurred by the Company in obtaining a contract are capitalized and amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, considering anticipated renewals when applicable. Certain contract related costs, including pre-placement brokerage costs, are capitalized as a cost to fulfill and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of control of the services to which the asset relates, which is generally less than one year.\nThe Company has elected to apply practical expedients to not disclose the revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations if (1) the contract has an original duration of 1 year or less, (2) the Company has recognized revenue for the amount in which it has the right to bill, and (3) the variable consideration is allocated entirely to an unsatisfied performance obligation which is recognized as a series\nof distinct goods or services that form a single performance obligation.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following is a description of principal service lines from which the Company generates its revenue:\nCommercial Risk Solutions\nincludes retail brokerage, specialty solutions, global risk consulting and captives management, and Affinity programs. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of allowances for estimated policy cancellations, which are determined based on an evaluation of historical and current cancellation data. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced near the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period.\nReinsurance Solutions\nincludes treaty reinsurance, facultative reinsurance, Strategy and Technology Group, and capital markets. Revenue primarily includes reinsurance commissions and fees for services rendered. Revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement using output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. For arrangements recognized over time, various output measures, including units delivered and time elapsed, are utilized to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the inception of the reinsurance period for certain reinsurance brokerage, or more commonly, over the term of the arrangement in installments based on deposit or minimum premiums for most treaty reinsurance arrangements.\nHealth Solutions\nincludes consulting and brokerage, Human Capital, and Consumer Benefits Solutions. Revenue primarily includes insurance commissions and fees for services rendered. For brokerage commissions, revenue is predominantly recognized at a point in time upon the effective date of the underlying policy (or policies), or for a limited number of arrangements, over the term of the arrangement to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services using input or output measures, including units delivered or time elapsed, to provide a faithful depiction of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation. Revenue from health care exchange arrangements is typically recognized upon successful enrollment of participants. Commissions and fees for brokerage services may be invoiced at the effective date of the underlying policy or over the term of the arrangement in installments during the policy period. Payment terms for other services vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.\n59\nWealth Solutions\nincludes retirement consulting and pension administration, as well as investments. Revenue recognized for these arrangements is predominantly recognized over the term of the arrangement using input or output measures to depict the transfer of control of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services, or for certain arrangements, at a point in time upon completion of the services. For consulting arrangements recognized over time, revenue will be recognized based on a measure of progress that depicts the transfer of control of the services to the customer, utilizing an appropriate input or output measure to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including units delivered or time elapsed. Fees paid by customers for consulting services are typically charged on an hourly, project or fixed-fee basis, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time incurred, days elapsed, or reports delivered. Revenue from time-and-materials or cost-plus arrangements are recognized as services are performed using input or output measures to provide a reasonable assessment of the progress towards completion of the performance obligation including hours worked, and revenue for these arrangements is typically recognized based on time and materials incurred. Revenue generated from the Company’s delegated investment business is generally earned as an agreed percentage based on AUM and, to a lesser extent, based on performance fees. Reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses are generally recorded as a component of revenue. Payment terms vary but are typically over the contract term in installments.\nShare-based Compensation Expense\nShare-based payments to employees, including grants of RSUs and PSAs, are measured based on grant date fair value. For purposes of measuring share-based compensation expense, the Company considered whether an adjustment to the observable market price is necessary to reflect material nonpublic information that is known to us at the time the award is granted. No adjustments were necessary for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. The Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to ultimately vest. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company records net periodic cost relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations that include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, inflation rates, mortality rates, compensation increases, and turnover rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and modifies these assumptions based on current rates and trends. The effects of gains, losses, and prior service costs and credits are amortized over future service periods or future estimated lives if the plans are frozen as reflected in Other income (expense) within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The funded status of each plan, calculated as the fair value of plan assets less the benefit obligation, is reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position using a December 31 measurement date.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding, including participating securities, which consist of unvested share awards with non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, which have been adjusted for the dilutive effect of potentially issuable ordinary shares, including certain contingently issuable shares. The diluted earnings per share calculation reflects the more dilutive effect of either (1) the two-class method that assumes that the participating securities have not been exercised, or (2) the treasury stock method.\nPotentially issuable shares are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share if their inclusion would be antidilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances and all highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less. Short-term investments generally consist of money market funds. The estimated fair value of Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments approximates their carrying values.\nAt December 31, 2022, Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments totaled\n$\n1,142\nmillion\ncompared to $\n836\nmillion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $\n306\nmillion. Of the total balance, $\n115\nmillion and $\n160\nmillion was restricted as to its use at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included within Short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 balances, respectively, were £\n60.1\nmillion ($\n72.5\nmillion at December 31, 2022 exchanges rates) and £\n84.3\nmillion ($\n112.8\nmillion at December 31, 2021 exchange rates) of operating funds required to be held by the Company in the U.K. by the FCA, a U.K.-based regulator.\n60\nFiduciary Assets and Liabilities\nIn its capacity as an insurance agent and broker, Aon collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commission, remits the premiums to the respective insurers. Aon also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers are recorded as Fiduciary assets in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity and the obligation to remit these funds is recorded as Fiduciary liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nFunds held on behalf of clients represent fiduciary assets held by Aon for premiums collected from insureds but not yet remitted to insurance companies and claims collected from insurance companies but not yet remitted to insureds of\n$\n6.4\nbillion\nand $\n6.1\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Fiduciary receivables were\n$\n9.5\nbillion\nand $\n8.3\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These funds and a corresponding liability are included in Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company’s estimate for allowance for credit losses with respect to receivables is based on a combination of factors, including evaluation of forward-looking information, historical write-offs, aging of balances, and other qualitative and quantitative analyses.\nReceivables, net included an allowance for doubtful accounts of\n$\n76\nmillion\nand $\n90\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFixed Assets\nFixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Included in this category are certain capitalized costs incurred during the application development stage related to directly obtaining, developing, or enhancing internal use software.\nDepreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally as follows:\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is allocated to applicable reporting units. Upon disposition of a business entity, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the relative fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it was included. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company may initially perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill balance is impaired. If a qualitative assessment is not performed or if a determination is made that it is not more likely than not that the value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then the Company will perform a quantitative analysis. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value limited to the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Any resulting difference will be a charge to Amortization and impairment of intangible assets in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the determination is made. Fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses.\n61\nWe classify our intangible assets acquired as either customer-related and contract based, technology, tradenames, or other intangibles.\nAmortization basis and estimated useful lives by intangible asset type are generally as follows:\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value. Where the Company has entered into master netting agreements with counterparties, the derivative positions are netted by counterparties and are reported accordingly in other assets or other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings each period, unless the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow or net investment hedge.\nThe Company has historically designated the following hedging relationships for certain transactions: (1) a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or firm commitment (“fair value hedge”), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows from a recognized variable-rate asset or liability or forecasted transaction (“cash flow hedge”), and (3) a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment hedge”).\nIn order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow, or a net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation must include a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, Aon’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, and the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Aon assesses the ongoing effectiveness of its hedges quarterly or more frequently if facts and circumstances require.\nFor a derivative designated as a fair value hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. The effect is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For a cash flow hedge that qualifies for hedge accounting, the change in fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged item impacts earnings. For a net investment hedge, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in Accumulate Other Comprehensive Income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as part of a hedging relationship (commonly referred to as an “economic hedge”) are recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period of change.\nThe Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, (2) the qualifying criteria are no longer met, or (3) management removes the designation of the hedging relationship.\nForeign Currency\nCertain of the Company’s non-U.S. operations use their respective local currency as their functional currency. These operations that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency translate their financial statements at the current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included in Net foreign currency translation adjustments within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. Further, gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency of that entity are included in Other income (expense) within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for the effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates and laws that are currently in effect. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in the period when the rate change is enacted.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if, based on the consideration of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax assets are realized by having sufficient future taxable income to allow the related tax benefits to reduce taxes otherwise payable. The sources of taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,\n62\nfuture taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, taxable income in carry-back years, and tax planning strategies that are both prudent and feasible.\nThe Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold but are not highly certain are initially and subsequently measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Only information that is available at the reporting date is considered in the Company’s recognition and measurement analysis, and events or changes in facts and circumstances are accounted for in the period in which the event or change in circumstance occurs.\nThe Company records penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income taxes in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe Company releases income tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the portfolio approach.\nLeases\nThe Company leases office facilities, equipment, and automobiles under operating and finance leases. The Company’s lease obligations are primarily for the use of office facilities. The Company evaluates if a leasing arrangement exists upon inception of a contract. A contract contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified tangible assets for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Identified property, plant, or equipment may include a physically distinct portion of a larger asset, or a portion of an asset that represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset but is not physically distinct. The Company assesses whether a contract implicitly contains the right to control the use of a tangible asset that is not already owned. In addition, the Company subleases certain real estate properties to third parties, which are classified as operating leases.\nThe Company’s leases expire at various dates and may contain renewal, expansion or termination options. The exercise of lease renewal and expansion options are typically at the Company’s sole discretion and are only included in the determination of the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements typically do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nROU assets and lease liabilities are based on the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company has elected the practical expedient related to lease and non-lease components, as an accounting policy election for all asset classes, which allows a lessee to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account for consideration received in a contract as a single lease component. The Company’s lease agreements may include initial direct costs and lease incentives. Initial direct costs are incremental costs of a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained and are included in the measurement of the ROU asset. Payments made to or on behalf of the Company, such as tenant improvement allowances, represent incentives that are considered reductions to the ROU asset and lease expense over the lease term.\nThe Company made a policy election to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases with an initial term of twelve months or less in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. However, the Company recognized these lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the expense was incurred. The Company applies this accounting policy across all classes of underlying assets.\nA portion of the Company’s lease agreements include variable lease payments that are not recorded in the initial measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset balances. For real estate arrangements, base rental payments may be escalated according to annual changes in the CPI or other indices. The escalated rental payments based on the estimated CPI at the lease commencement date are included within minimum rental payments; however, changes in CPI are considered variable in nature and are recognized as variable lease costs in the period in which the obligation is incurred. Additionally, real estate lease agreements may include other variable payments related to operating expenses charged by the landlord based on actual expenditures. Information technology equipment agreements may include variable payments based on usage of the equipment. These expenses are also recognized as variable lease costs in the period in which the expense is incurred.\nThe Company utilizes discount rates to determine the present value of the lease payments based on information available at the commencement date of the lease. As the rate implicit in each lease is not typically readily available, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on factors such as the lease term and the economic environment where the lease exists to determine the appropriate present value of future lease payments. When determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers the rate of interest it would pay on a secured borrowing in an amount equal to the lease payments for the underlying asset under similar terms.\n63\nOperating leases are included in Operating lease ROU assets, Other current liabilities, and Non-current operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Finance leases are included in Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities, and Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Aon plc and those entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. To determine if Aon holds a controlling financial interest in an entity, the Company first evaluates if it is required to apply the variable interest model to the entity, otherwise, the entity is evaluated under the voting interest model. When Aon holds rights that give it the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, combined with a variable interest that gives the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses, the Company has a controlling financial interest in that VIE. The Company does not hold a controlling financial interest over any VIEs that significantly impacts the VIE’s economic performance and the Company does not have rights to any significant benefits or obligations to absorb potentially significant losses. Thus, the Company does not consolidate any VIEs and Aon’s interest in VIEs as of December 31, 2022 was insignificant.\nAon holds a controlling financial interest in entities that are not VIEs when it, directly or indirectly holds more than 50% of the voting rights and the noncontrolling interest holders do not hold substantive participating rights.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nAll issued, but not yet effective, guidance has been deemed not applicable or not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n3.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table summarizes revenue from contracts with customers by principal service line (in millions):\nConsolidated revenue from contracts with customers by geographic area, which is attributed on the basis of where the services are performed, is as follows (in millions):\n64\nContract Costs\nChanges in the net carrying amount of costs to fulfill contracts with customers are as follows (in millions):\nChanges in the net carrying amount of costs to obtain contracts with customers are as follows (in millions):\n4.\nOther Financial Data\nConsolidated Statements of Income Information\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe components of Other income (expense) are as follows (in millions):\n(1)  Refer to Note 11 “Employee Benefits” for further information.\n65\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position Information\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nChanges in the net carrying amount of allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows (in millions):\nOther Current Assets\nThe components of Other current assets are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nRefer to Note 3 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for further information.\nFixed Assets, net\nThe components of Fixed assets, net are as follows (in millions):\nDepreciation expense, which includes software amortization, was $\n151\nmillion, $\n179\nmillion, and $\n167\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n66\nOther Non-current Assets\nThe components of Other non-current assets are as follows (in millions):\n(1)    Refer to Note 3 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for further information.\n(2)    Refer to Note 8 “Lease Commitments” for further information.\nOther Current Liabilities\nThe components of Other current liabilities are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\n$\n653\nmillion\nand $\n553\nmillion was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 8 “Lease Commitments” for further information.\nOther Non-current Liabilities\nThe components of Other non-current liabilities are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nIncludes $\n129\nmillion and $\n145\nmillion for the non-current portion of the transition tax as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

The acquisition-date fair value of the previous equity interest was $\n15\nmillion and is included in the measurement of consideration transferred. There was no significant impact as a result of remeasuring the carrying value of the Company’s prior equity interest in Anviti held before the business combination.\n68\nCompleted Dispositions\nThe Company completed\nthree\ndispositions during the year ended December 31, 2022.

The U.S. Program was fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, and Aon Global Holdings plc and the European Program was fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Aon plc, Aon Global Limited, and Aon Corporation.\n71\nCommercial paper outstanding, which is included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, is as follows (in millions):\nThe weighted average commercial paper outstanding and its related interest rates are as follows (in millions, except percentages):\n8.\nLease Commitments\nThe classification of operating and finance lease asset and liability balances within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are as follows (in millions):\nThe components of lease costs are as follows (in millions):\n(1)   Short-term lease cost does not include expenses related to leases with a lease term of one month or less.\n72\nWeighted average remaining lease term and discount rate related to operating and finance leases are as follows:\nOther cash and non-cash related activities are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nThe Company has recorded non-cash changes in Operating lease ROU assets and Non-current operating lease liabilities through Other assets and liabilities in Cash flows from operations within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nMaturity analysis of operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2022 are as follows (in millions):\n73\n9.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income tax and the provision for income tax consist of the following (in millions):\nIncome before income taxes shown above is based on the location of the business unit to which such earnings are attributable for tax purposes. In addition, because the earnings shown above may, in some cases, be subject to taxation in more than one country, the income tax provision shown above as Ireland, U.K., U.S. or Other may not correspond to the geographic attribution of the earnings.\n74\nThe Company performs a reconciliation of the income tax provisions based on its domicile and statutory rate at each reporting period. The reconciliation of the income tax provisions based on the Irish statutory corporate tax rate of 25% to the provisions reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements is as follows:\n(1)\nThe Company determines the adjustment for taxes on international operations based on the difference between the statutory tax rate applicable to earnings in each foreign jurisdiction and the enacted rate of\n25.0\n%,\n25.0\n% and\n25.0\n% at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The benefit to the Company’s effective income tax rate from taxes on international operations relates to benefits from lower-taxed global operations, primarily due to the use of global funding structures and the tax holiday in Singapore.\n(2)\nIn July 2020, final U.S. tax regulations were issued regarding the GILTI high tax election, allowing taxpayers to exclude from GILTI the income of a Controlled Foreign Corporation that incurs a foreign tax rate more than 90% of the top U.S. corporate tax rate. A GILTI high tax election may be made on an annual basis, and taxpayers may choose to apply the election to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company expects to make the GILTI high-tax election for 2022 and therefore recorded the impact of making the election.\n(3)\nExcess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment transactions are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\n75\nThe Company has elected to account for GILTI in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore has not provided deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nDeferred income taxes (assets and liabilities have been netted by jurisdiction) have been classified in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as follows (in millions):\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly. Considerations with respect to the realizability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the deferred tax asset, historical earnings and projected future taxable income by jurisdiction as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of future taxable income. Valuation allowances have been established primarily with regard to the tax benefits of certain tax credits and net operating losses, capital losses, and interest carryforwards. Valuation allowances increased by $\n45\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, when compared to December 31, 2021. The change is primarily attributable to an increase in valuation allowances related to net operating losses and foreign tax credits.\n76\nThe Company generally intends to limit distributions from foreign subsidiaries in excess of U.S. tax earnings and profits (except where distributions would be limited by available cash) and to limit repatriations from certain other jurisdictions that would otherwise generate a U.S. tax liability. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has accrued $\n38\nmillion for local country income taxes, withholding taxes and state income taxes on those undistributed earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on outside basis differences in our investments in our foreign subsidiaries that are unrelated to these accumulated undistributed earnings, as these outside basis differences are indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to these other components of our outside basis differences is not practicable.\nThe Company had the following carryforwards (in millions):\nThe U.K. operating losses and capital losses have an indefinite carryforward period. The federal operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates between 2034 and 2036 while federal operating loss carryforwards generated after this date have indefinite carryforward periods. State net operating losses as of December 31, 2022 have various carryforward periods and will begin to expire in 2023. Federal and state capital losses can be carried forward until 2023. Federal and state interest carryforwards have indefinite carryforward periods. Foreign tax credits can be carried forward for ten years and will begin to expire in 2028. Operating, capital losses, and other carryforwards in other non-U.S. jurisdictions have various carryforward periods and will begin to expire in 2023. The interest carryforwards in other non-U.S. jurisdictions have an indefinite carryforward period.\nDuring 2012, the Company was granted a tax holiday for the period from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2022, with respect to withholding taxes and certain income derived from services in Singapore. The Company has been granted a new incentive for the period October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2032. The new incentive provides for a reduced withholding tax rate and a reduced tax rate on certain income derived from services in Singapore, as long as certain conditions are met.\nThe benefit realized was approximately $\n115\nmillion, $\n104\nmillion, and $\n97\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The impact of this tax holiday on diluted earnings per share was $\n0.54\n, $\n0.46\n, and $\n0.42\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n77\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Company’s beginning and ending amount of uncertain tax positions (in millions):\nThe Company’s liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, includes $\n535\nmillion, $\n295\nmillion, and $\n270\nmillion, respectively, related to amounts that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change in the next twelve months; however, the Company does not expect the change to have a significant impact on its consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes within the next twelve months cannot be made.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in its provision for income taxes. The Company accrued potential interest and penalties of $\n40\nmillion, $\n22\nmillion, and $\n21\nmillion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company recorded a liability for interest and penalties of $\n181\nmillion, $\n142\nmillion, and $\n120\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters for years through 2007. Material U.S. state and local income tax jurisdiction examinations have been concluded for years through 2014. The Company has concluded income tax examinations in its primary non-U.S. jurisdictions through 2008.\n10.\nShareholders’ Equity (Deficit)\nDistributable Profits\nThe Company is required under Irish law to have available “distributable profits” to make share repurchases or pay dividends to shareholders. Distributable profits are created through the earnings of the Irish parent company and, among other methods, through intercompany dividends or a reduction in share capital approved by the High Court of Ireland. Distributable profits are not linked to a U.S. GAAP reported amount (e.g., accumulated deficit). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had distributable profits in excess of $\n29.0\nbillion and $\n32.7\nbillion, respectively. We believe that we have the ability to create sufficient distributable profits for the foreseeable future.\nOrdinary Shares\nAon has a share repurchase program authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Repurchase Program was established in April 2012 with $\n5.0\nbillion in authorized repurchases and was increased by $\n5.0\nbillion in authorized repurchases in each of November 2014, June 2017, and November 2020, and by $\n7.5\nbillion in February 2022 for a total of $\n27.5\nbillion in repurchase authorizations.\nUnder the Repurchase Program, the Company’s class A ordinary shares may be repurchased through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, based on prevailing market conditions and will be funded from available capital.\n78\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s share repurchase activity (in millions, except per share data):\nAt December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized amount for share repurchases under the Repurchase Program was approximately $\n6.0\nbillion. Under the Repurchase Program, the Company has repurchased a total of\n160.7\nmillion shares for an aggregate cost of approximately $\n21.5\nbillion.\nWeighted Average Ordinary Shares\nWeighted average ordinary shares outstanding are as follows (in millions):\nPotentially issuable shares are not included in the computation of Diluted net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders if their inclusion would be antidilutive. There were\n0.8\nmillion and\n0.3\nmillion shares excluded from the calculation in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and\nno\nshares excluded from the calculation in 2020.\n79\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nChanges in Accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of related tax, are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nReclassifications from this category included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are recorded in Total revenue, Interest expense, and Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 13 “Derivatives and Hedging” for further information regarding the Company’s derivative and hedging activity.\n(2)\nReclassifications from this category included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are recorded in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n80\n11.\nEmployee Benefits\nDefined Contribution Savings Plans\nAon maintains defined contribution savings plans for the benefit of its employees. The expense recognized for these plans is included in Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe expense for the significant plans in the U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada is as follows (in millions):\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement health and welfare plans that provide retirement, medical, and life insurance benefits. The postretirement health care plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance and pension plans are generally noncontributory. The significant U.S., U.K., Netherlands, and Canada pension plans are closed to new entrants.\n81\nPension Plans\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligations and fair value of assets for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and a statement of the funded status as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, for Aon’s significant U.K., U.S., and other major pension plans, which are located in the Netherlands and Canada. These plans represent approximately\n88\n% of the Company’s projected benefit obligations.\nThe benefit obligation decreased primarily as a result of increases in the discount rates in 2022 as compared to 2021. The value of plan assets decreased as a result of negative asset returns, predominately in the U.K, and overall weaker exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar. The U.K. pension assets are concentrated in fixed income and annuities which were disproportionately negatively impacted by the rising interest rate environment. The U.K. hedging strategy continues to perform as expected and the related pension plans remain over-funded.\nNet actuarial gains decreased the benefit obligation in 2021 primarily due to the increase in the discount rates.\nIn November 2022, to further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. The transaction settled $\n280\nmillion of benefit obligations using $\n280\nmillion of assets.\nIn November 2020, the Company entered into an insurance contract that covers a portion of the assets within a select U.K. pension scheme. The transaction resulted in a decrease in Prepaid pension assets and Accumulated other comprehensive income of $\n94\nmillion.\n82\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position consist of (in millions):\n(1)\nIncluded in Prepaid pension.\n(2)\nIncluded in Other current liabilities.\n(3)\nIncluded in Pension, other postretirement, and postemployment liabilities.\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (income) that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost at December 31, 2022 and 2021 consist of (in millions):\nIn 2022, U.S. plans with a PBO and an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $\n2.2\nbillion, an ABO of $\n2.2\nbillion, and plan assets with a fair value of $\n1.5\nbillion. U.K. plans with a PBO and an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $\n114\nmillion, an ABO of $\n114\nmillion and, plan assets with a fair value of $\n93\nmillion. Other plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $\n1.1\nbillion and plan assets with a fair value of $\n1.0\nbillion, and other plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had an ABO of $\n220\nmillion and plan assets with a fair value of $\n166\nmillion.\nIn 2021, U.S. plans with a PBO and an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $\n3.2\nbillion, an ABO of $\n3.2\nbillion, and plan assets with a fair value of $\n2.4\nbillion. U.K. plans with a PBO and an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $\n17\nmillion, an ABO of $\n17\nmillion and no plan assets. Other plans with a PBO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had a PBO of $\n1.5\nbillion and plan assets with a fair value of $\n1.4\nbillion, and other plans with an ABO in excess of the fair value of plan assets had an ABO of $\n409\nmillion and plan assets with a fair value of $\n326\nmillion.\nService cost is reported in Compensation and benefits and all other components are reported in Other income (expense) as follows (in millions):\nThe Company uses a full-yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for its major pension and other postretirement benefit plans. This estimation was obtained by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\n83\nIn November 2022, to further its pension de-risking strategy the Company purchased an annuity for portions of its U.S. pension plans that will settle certain obligations. This triggered settlement accounting which required immediate recognition of a portion of the accumulated losses associated with the plan. Consequently, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement charge of approximately $\n170\nmillion in 2022.\nTransfer payments from certain U.K. pension plans exceeded the plan’s service and interest cost in 2021 and 2020. This triggered settlement accounting which required immediate recognition of a portion of the accumulated losses associated with the plan. Consequently, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement charge for approximately £\n3\nmillion in 2021 ($\n5\nmillion using December 31, 2021 exchange rates), and approximately £\n2\nmillion in 2020 ($\n2\nmillion using December 31, 2020 exchange rates).\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows:\n(1)\nU.S. pension plans are frozen and therefore not impacted by compensation increases or price inflation.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost are as follows:\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nTo determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the historical performance, investment community forecasts, and current market conditions are analyzed to develop expected returns for each asset class used by the plans. The expected returns for each asset class are weighted by the target allocations of the plans. The expected return of\n5.28\n% on U.S. plan assets reflects a portfolio that is seeking asset growth through a higher equity allocation while maintaining prudent risk levels. The portfolio contains certain assets that have historically resulted in higher returns, as well as other financial instruments to minimize downside risk.\nNo plan assets are expected to be returned to the Company during 2023.\nFair value of plan assets\nThe Company determined the fair value of plan assets through numerous procedures based on the asset class and available information. Refer to Note 14 “Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments” for a description of the procedures performed to determine the fair value of the plan assets.\n84\nThe fair values of the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, by asset category, are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nConsists of cash and institutional short-term investment funds.\n(2)\nCertain investments measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the above table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair values to the amounts presented in the plan assets contained in this Note.\n(3)\nConsists of property funds and trusts holding direct real estate investments.\n(4)\nConsists of limited partnerships, private equity, and hedge funds.\n85\nThe fair values of the Company’s major U.K. pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, by asset category, are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nConsists of cash and institutional short-term investment funds.\n(2)\nCertain investments measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the above table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair values to the amounts presented in the plan assets contained in this Note.\n(3)\nConsists of equity securities and equity derivatives, including repurchase agreements.\n(4)\nConsists of property funds and trusts holding direct real estate investments.\n(5)\nConsists of multi-strategy limited partnerships, private equity, hedge funds, and collective investment schemes with a diversified portfolio of cash, equities, equity related securities, derivatives, and/or fixed income securities.\n86\nThe following table presents the changes in the Level 3 fair-value category in the Company’s U.K. pension plans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in millions):\nThe fair values of the Company’s other major pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, by asset category, are as follows (in millions):\n87\n(1)\nConsists of cash and institutional short-term investment funds.\n(2)\nCertain investments measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the above table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair values to the amounts presented in the plan assets contained in this Note.\n(3)\nConsists of limited partnerships, private equity, and hedge funds.\n(4)\nConsists of property funds and trusts holding direct real estate investments.\nInvestment Policy and Strategy\nThe U.S. investment policy, as established by the RPGIC, seeks reasonable asset growth at prudent risk levels within weighted average target\nallocations. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average targeted allocation for the U.S. plans was\n30\n% for equity investments,\n54\n% for fixed income investments, and\n16\n% for other investments. Aon believes that plan assets are well-diversified and are of appropriate quality. The investment portfolio asset allocation is reviewed quarterly and re-balanced to be within policy target allocations. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate by the RPGIC. The investment policies for international plans are generally established by the local pension plan trustees and seek to maintain the plans’ ability to meet liabilities and to comply with local minimum funding requirements. Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios that provide adequate levels of return at an acceptable level of risk. The investment policies are reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate to ensure that the objectives are being met. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average targeted allocation for the U.K. and non-U.S. plans was\n6\n% for equity investments,\n86\n% for fixed income investments, and\n8\n% for other investments.\nCash Flows\nContributions\nBased on current assumptions, in 2023, the Company expects to contribute approximately $\n4\nmillion, $\n43\nmillion, and $\n14\nmillion to its significant U.K., U.S., and other major pension plans, respectively.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nEstimated future benefit payments for plans, not including voluntary one-time lump sum payments, are as follows at December 31, 2022 (in millions):\n88\nU.S. and Canadian Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe following table provides an overview of the accumulated PBO, fair value of plan assets, funded status and net amount recognized as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 for the Company’s other significant postretirement benefit plans located in the U.S. and Canada (in millions):\nOther information related to the Company’s other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nBased on current assumptions, the Company expects:\n•\nThe amount in Accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost during 2023 is $\n0.8\nmillion net gain and $\n0.2\nmillion of prior-service credit.\n•\nTo contribute $\n5\nmillion to fund significant other postretirement benefit plans during 2023.\n•\nEstimated future benefit payments will be approximately $\n5\nmillion each year for 2023 through 2027, and $\n27\nmillion in aggregate for 2028-2032.\n12.\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nThe following table summarizes share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Compensation and benefits (in millions):\n(1)    2021 includes expenses related to the Aon United Growth Ownership Plan.\nRestricted Share Units\nRSUs generally vest between\nthree\nand\nfive years\n. The fair value of RSUs is based upon the market value of the Company’s class A ordinary shares at the date of grant. With certain limited exceptions, any break in continuous employment will cause the forfeiture of all non-vested awards. Compensation expense associated with RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Dividend equivalents are paid on certain RSUs, based on the initial grant amount.\n89\nThe following table summarizes the status of the Company’s RSUs (shares in thousands, except fair value):\n(1)\nRepresents per share weighted average fair value of award at date of grant.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of the Company's RSU awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 was $\n279\n, $\n253\n, and $\n185\n, respectively. The fair value of RSUs that vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $\n216\nmillion, $\n189\nmillion, and $\n190\nmillion, respectively.\nUnamortized deferred compensation expense amounted to $\n466\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, with a remaining weighted average amortization period of approximately\n2.0\nyears.\nPerformance Share Awards\nThe vesting of PSAs is contingent upon meeting a cumulative level of adjusted diluted earnings per share related performance over a\nthree-year\nperiod. The actual issuance of shares may range from\n0\n-\n200\n% of the target number of PSAs granted, based on the terms of the plan and level of achievement of the related performance target. The grant date fair value of PSAs is based upon the market price of the Company’s class A ordinary shares at the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends foregone during the vesting period. The performance conditions are not considered in the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period based on management’s estimate of the number of units expected to vest. Management evaluates its estimate of the actual number of shares expected to be issued at the end of the programs on a quarterly basis. The cumulative effect of the change in estimate is recognized in the period of change as an adjustment to Compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income, if necessary. Dividend equivalents are not paid on PSAs.\nThe following table summarizes the status of the Company's PSAs at 100% of the targeted amount (shares in thousands, except fair value):\n(1)\nRepresents per share weighted average fair value of award at date of grant.\nThe per share weighted-average grant date fair value of the Company's PSA awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 was $\n311\n, $\n225\n, and $\n163\n, respectively. The payout of shares in 2022 with respect to the PSA awards granted in 2019 based on performance for the three-year performance period ended 2021 was, in aggregate,\n888\nthousand shares. The fair value of PSAs that vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $\n145\nmillion, $\n112\nmillion, and $\n121\nmillion, respectively.\nUnamortized compensation expense, based on current performance levels, amounted to $\n126\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, with a remaining weighted average amortization period of approximately\n1.3\nyears.\n13.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nThe Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage the risk related to these exposures, the Company enters into various derivative instruments that reduce these risks by creating offsetting exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\n90\nForeign Exchange Risk Management\nThe Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk when it earns revenues, pays expenses, enters into monetary intercompany transfers or other transactions denominated in a currency that differs from its functional currency. The Company uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts, options and cross-currency swaps, to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. These exposures are hedged, on average, for less than\ntwo years\n. These derivatives are accounted for as hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded each period in Other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe Company also uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts and options, to economically hedge the currency exposure of the Company’s global liquidity profile, including monetary assets or liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency of an entity, typically on a rolling\n90\n-day basis, but may be for up to\none year\nin the future. These derivatives are not accounted for as hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded each period in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe notional and fair values of derivative instruments are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nIncluded within Other current assets ($\n3\nmillion in 2022 and $\n21\nmillion in 2021) or Other non-current assets ($\n9\nmillion in 2022 and $\n8\nmillion in 2021).\n(2)\nIncluded within Other current liabilities ($\n2\nmillion in 2022) or Other non-current liabilities ($\n1\nmillion in 2022).\n(3)\nThese contracts typically are for\n90\n-day durations and executed close to the last day of the most recent reporting month, thereby resulting in nominal fair values at the balance sheet date.\nThe amounts of derivative gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows (in millions):\nThe amounts of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows (in millions):\nThe Company estimates that approximately $\n10\nmillion of pretax loss currently included within Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months.\nThe Company recorded a gain of $\n11\nmillion in 2022, a loss of $\n24\nmillion in 2021, and a gain of $\n1\nmillion in 2020 in Other income (expense) for foreign exchange derivatives not designated or qualifying as hedges.\n91\n14.\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nAccounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair values as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 — observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets in active markets;\n•\nLevel 2 — inputs other than quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n•\nLevel 3 — unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires the use of valuation techniques and the development of assumptions.\nThe following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments, including pension assets (refer to Note 11 “Employee Benefits”):\nMoney market funds\nconsist of institutional prime, treasury, and government money market funds. The Company reviews treasury and government money market funds to obtain reasonable assurance that the fund net asset value is $1 per share and reviews the floating net asset value of institutional prime money market funds for reasonableness.\nCash and cash equivalents\nconsist of cash and institutional short-term investment funds. The Company reviews the short-term investment funds to obtain reasonable assurance that the fund net asset value is $1 per share.\nEquity investments\nconsist of equity securities and equity derivatives valued using the closing stock price on a national securities exchange. Over the counter equity derivatives are valued using observable inputs such as underlying prices of the underlying security and volatility. On a sample basis the Company reviews the listing of Level 1 equity securities in the portfolio, agrees the closing stock prices to a national securities exchange, and independently verifies the observable inputs for Level 2 equity derivatives and securities.\nFixed income investments\nconsist of certain categories of bonds and derivatives. Corporate, government, and agency bonds are valued by pricing vendors who estimate fair value using recently executed transactions and proprietary models based on observable inputs, such as interest rate spreads, yield curves, and credit risk. Asset-backed securities are valued by pricing vendors who estimate fair value using DCF models utilizing observable inputs based on trade and quote activity of securities with similar features. Fixed income derivatives are valued by pricing vendors using observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves. The Company obtains an understanding of the models, inputs, and assumptions used in developing prices provided by its vendors through discussions with the fund managers. The Company independently verifies the observable inputs, as well as assesses assumptions used for reasonableness based on relevant market conditions and internal Company guidelines. If an assumption is deemed unreasonable, based on internal Company guidelines, it is then reviewed by management and the fair value estimate provided by the vendor is adjusted, if deemed appropriate. These adjustments do not occur frequently and historically are not material to the fair value estimates used in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPooled funds\nconsist of various equity, fixed income, and real estate mutual fund type investment vehicles. Pooled investment funds fair value is estimated based on the proportionate share ownership in the underlying net assets of the investment, which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities. The underlying securities typically trade on a national securities exchange or may be valued by the fund managers using applicable models, inputs, and assumptions. The Company gains an understanding of the investment guidelines and valuation policies of the fund and discusses fund performance with pooled fund managers. The Company obtains audited fund manager financial statements, when available. If the pooled fund is designed to replicate a publicly traded index, the Company compares the performance of the fund to the index to assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurement.\nAlternative investments\nconsist of limited partnerships, private equity, and hedge funds. Alternative investment fair value is generally estimated based on the proportionate share ownership in the underlying net assets of the investment as determined by the general partner or investment manager. The valuations are based on various factors depending on investment strategy, proprietary models, and specific financial data or projections. The Company obtains audited fund manager financial statements, when available. The Company obtains a detailed understanding of the models, inputs, and assumptions used in developing prices provided by the investment managers, or appropriate party, through regular discussions. The Company also obtains the investment manger’s valuation policies and assesses the assumptions used for reasonableness based on relevant market conditions and internal Company guidelines. If an assumption is deemed unreasonable, based on the Company’s guidelines, it is then reviewed by management and the fair value estimate provided by the vendor is adjusted, if deemed appropriate. These adjustments do not occur frequently and historically are not material to the fair value estimates in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n92\nDerivatives\nare carried at fair value, based upon industry standard valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced pricing inputs, such as interest rates, currency exchange rates, or implied volatility.\nAnnuity contracts\nconsist of insurance group annuity contracts purchased to match the pension benefit payment stream owed to certain selected plan participant demographics within a few major U.K. defined benefit plans. Annuity contracts are valued using a DCF model utilizing assumptions such as discount rate, mortality, and inflation.\nReal estate and REITs\nconsist of publicly traded REITs and direct real estate investments. Level 1 REITs are valued using the closing stock price on a national securities exchange. Non-Level 1 values are based on the proportionate share of ownership in the underlying net asset value as determined by the investment manager. The Company independently reviews the listing of Level 1 REIT securities in the portfolio and agrees the closing stock prices to a national securities exchange. The Company gains an understanding of the investment guidelines and valuation policies of the non-Level 1 real estate funds and discusses performance with the fund managers. The Company obtains audited fund manager financial statements, when available. See the description of “Alternative investments” for further detail on valuation procedures surrounding non-Level 1 REITs.\nDebt\nis carried at outstanding principal balance, less any unamortized issuance costs, discount or premium. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or estimates using DCF analyses based on current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.\nThe following tables present the categorization of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 (in millions):\n(1)\nIncluded within Fiduciary assets or Short-term investments in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, depending on their nature and initial maturity.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 13 “Derivatives and Hedging” for additional information regarding the Company’s derivatives and hedging activity.\nThere were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value hierarchy levels during 2022 or 2021. The Company recognized\nno\nrealized or unrealized gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to assets and liabilities measured at fair value using unobservable inputs in 2022, 2021, or 2020.\n93\nThe fair value of debt is classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table provides the carrying value and fair value for the Company’s term debt (in millions):\n15.\nClaims, Lawsuits, and Other Contingencies\nLegal\nAon and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, which frequently include E&O claims. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble, or extraordinary damages. While Aon maintains meaningful E&O insurance and other insurance programs to provide protection against certain losses that arise in such matters, Aon has exhausted or materially depleted its coverage under some of the policies that protect the Company and, consequently, is self-insured or materially self-insured for some claims. Accruals for these exposures, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, are included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and have been recognized in Other general expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These amounts are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. Matters that are not probable and reasonably estimable are not accrued for in the financial statements.\nThe Company is not subject to current matters in connection with which the Company believes (1) material loss (including interest and costs) is probable, (2) material loss (including interest and costs) is reasonably possible (that is, more than remote but not probable), or (3) there exists the reasonable possibility of material loss (including interest and costs) greater than the accrued amount. The Company includes in the current matters described below certain matters in which it believes a material loss is remote but in which the claimed amounts are significant. Although management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon, legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or other events. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary or punitive damages imposed on Aon or its subsidiaries. If unfavorable outcomes of these matters were to occur, future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially adversely affected.\nCurrent Matters\nAon Hewitt Investment Consulting, Inc, now known as Aon Investments USA, Inc. (“Aon Investments”), Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and the Administrative Committee of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (collectively “Lowe’s”) were sued on April 27, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (the “Court”) in a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of participants in the Lowe’s 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”). Aon Investments provided investment consulting services to Lowe’s under ERISA. The plaintiffs contend that in 2015 Lowe’s imprudently placed the Hewitt Growth Fund in the Plan’s lineup of investments, the Hewitt Growth Fund underperformed its benchmarks, and that Aon had a conflict of interest in recommending the proprietary fund for the Plan. The plaintiffs allege the Plan suffered over $\n200\nmillion in investment losses when compared to the eight funds it replaced. The plaintiffs allege that Aon Investments breached its duties of loyalty and prudence pursuant to ERISA. The matter was tried to the Court the last week of June 2021, and the Court entered judgment in favor of Aon on all claims on October 12, 2021. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and oral argument took place on December 7, 2022. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims and appeal.\nAon faces legal action arising out of a fatal plane crash in November 2016. Aon U.K. Limited placed an aviation civil liability reinsurance policy for the Bolivian insurer of the airline. After the crash, the insurer determined that there was no coverage under the airline’s insurance policy due to the airline’s breach of various policy conditions. In November 2018, the owner of the aircraft filed a claim in Bolivia against Aon, the airline, the insurer and the insurance broker. The claim is for $\n16\nmillion plus any liability the owner has to third parties. In November 2019, a federal prosecutor in Brazil filed a public civil action naming\nthree\nAon entities as defendants, along with the airline, the insurer, and the lead reinsurer. That claim seeks pecuniary damages for families affected by the crash in the sum of $\n300\nmillion; or, in the alternative, $\n50\nmillion; or, in the alternative, $\n25\nmillion; plus “moral damages” of an equivalent sum. Separately, in March 2020, the Brazilian Federal Senate invited Aon to give evidence to a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry in an investigation into the accident. Aon cooperated with that inquiry. In August 2020,\n43\nindividuals (surviving passengers and estates of the deceased) filed a motion in the Circuit Court of\n94\nthe 11th Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, seeking permission to commence proceedings against Aon (and the insurer and reinsurers) for claims totaling $\n844\nmillion. Finally, in April 2021, representatives of\n16\npassengers issued a claim against Aon in the High Court in England seeking damages under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 in the sum of £\n29\nmillion ($\n35\nmillion at December 31, 2022 exchange rates). In December 2022, the High Court in England granted an anti-suit injunction, restricting the\n43\nindividuals who previously filed a motion in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida, from continuing litigation in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit against Aon. Aon believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against the remaining claims.\nSettled/Closed Matters\nOn October 3, 2017, CCC invoked arbitration to pursue a claim that it asserts against Aon New Zealand. Aon provided insurance broking services to CCC in relation to CCC’s 2010-2011 material damage and business interruption program. In December 2015, CCC settled its property and business interruption claim for its losses arising from the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes against the underwriter of its material damage and business interruption program and the reinsurers of that underwriter. CCC contends that acts and omissions by Aon caused CCC to recover less in that settlement than it otherwise would have. CCC claimed damages of approximately NZD\n320\nmillion ($\n202\nmillion at December 31, 2022 exchange rates) plus interest and costs. In December 2022, the case was settled with no admission of liability on the part of Aon.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nThe Company provides a variety of guarantees and indemnifications to its customers and others. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the notional amounts that could become payable under the guarantees and indemnifications if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or other methods. These amounts may bear no relationship to the expected future payments, if any, for these guarantees and indemnifications. Any anticipated amounts payable are included in the Financial Statements and are recorded at fair value.\nThe Company expects that, as prudent business interests dictate, additional guarantees and indemnifications may be issued from time to time.\nGuarantee of Registered Securities\nIn connection with the Ireland Reorganization, on April 1, 2020, Aon plc and Aon Global Holdings plc entered into various agreements pursuant to which they agreed to guarantee the obligations of Aon Corporation arising under issued and outstanding debt securities, which were previously guaranteed solely by Aon Global Limited and the obligations of Aon Global Limited arising under issued and outstanding debt securities, which were previously guaranteed solely by Aon Corporation. Those agreements include: (1) Second Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, and Aon Global Holdings plc and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”) (amending and restating the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 2, 2012, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee); (2) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated December 12, 2012, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited plc and the Trustee); (3) Second Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Amended and Restated Indenture, dated May 20, 2015, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee); (4) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated November 13, 2015, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee); and (5) Amended and Restated Indenture, dated April 1, 2020, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited, Aon plc, Aon Global Holdings plc and the Trustee (amending and restating the Indenture, dated December 3, 2018, among Aon Corporation, Aon Global Limited and the Trustee).\nLetters of Credit\nAon has entered into a number of arrangements whereby the Company’s performance on certain obligations is guaranteed by a third party through the issuance of LOCs. The Company had total LOCs outstanding of approximately $\n74\nmillion at December 31, 2022, and $\n75\nmillion at December 31, 2021. These LOCs cover the beneficiaries related to certain of Aon’s U.S. and Canadian non-qualified pension plan schemes and secure deductible retentions for Aon’s own workers compensation program. The Company has also obtained LOCs to cover contingent payments for taxes and other business obligations to third parties, and other guarantees for miscellaneous purposes at its international subsidiaries.\n95\nPremium Payments\nThe Company has certain contractual contingent guarantees for premium payments owed by clients to certain insurance companies. The maximum exposure with respect to such contractual contingent guarantees was approximately\n$\n173\nmillion\nat December 31, 2022 compared to $\n153\nmillion at December 31, 2021.\n16.\nSegment Information\nThe Company operates as\none\nsegment that includes all of Aon’s operations, which as a global professional services firm provides a broad range of risk, health, and wealth solutions through\nfour\nsolution lines which make up its principal products and services. The CODM assesses the performance of the Company and allocates resources based on\none\nsegment: Aon United.\nThe Company’s reportable operating segment has been determined using a management approach, which is consistent with the basis and manner in which the CODM uses financial information for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. The CODM assesses performance and allocates resources based on total Aon results against its key\nfour\nmetrics, expense discipline, and collaborative behaviors that maximize value for Aon and its shareholders, regardless of which solution line it benefits.\nAs Aon operates as\none\nsegment, segment profit or loss is consistent with consolidated reporting as disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 3 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for further information on revenue by principal service line.\nConsolidated long-lived assets, net by geographic area are as follows (in millions):\n96"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded as of December 31, 2022 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to Aon, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to Aon’s management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of Aon plc is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013 Framework)\n.\nBased on this assessment, management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst & Young, LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report titled “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.”\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo changes in Aon’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during 2022 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, Aon’s internal control over financial reporting.\n97\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Aon plc\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe\nhave audited Aon plc’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Aon plc (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 17, 2023\n98"
