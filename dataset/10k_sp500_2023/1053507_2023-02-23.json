    "text": "Overview\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting, structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\nIn 2022, we launched operations in New Zealand through the acquisition of land under carrier or other third-party communications sites from Clearspan Pty Ltd for total consideration of approximately 50.1 million New Zealand Dollars (approximately $28.7 million at the date of closing). As of December 31, 2022, our communications real estate portfolio of 224,768 communications sites included 43,275 communications sites in the U.S. & Canada, 78,469 communications sites in Asia-Pacific, 23,755 communications sites in Africa, 30,721 communications sites in Europe and 48,548 communications sites in Latin America, as well as (i) urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico, South Africa and Spain, (ii) other property interests in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States and (iii) 28 data center facilities across ten United States markets.\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation (“CoreSite”), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite’s existing debt (the “CoreSite Acquisition”).\nIn 2022, in connection with the funding of the CoreSite Acquisition, we entered into agreements with certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Partners LP (such investment vehicles, collectively, “Stonepeak”) for Stonepeak to acquire a noncontrolling ownership interest in our U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of approximately $3.1 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity (the “Stonepeak Transaction”). As of December 31, 2022, we hold a common equity interest of approximately 72% in our U.S. data center business, with Stonepeak holding approximately 28% of the outstanding common equity and 100% of the outstanding mandatorily convertible preferred equity. On a fully converted basis, which is expected to occur four years from the date of the initial closing in August 2022, and on the basis of the currently outstanding equity, we will hold a controlling ownership interest in our U.S. data center business of approximately 64%, with Stonepeak holding approximately 36%.\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2022, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n1\nWe report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\nProducts and Services\nProperty Operations\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 97% and 99% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n•\nLong-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations.\nIn general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2022, we expect to generate over $62 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n•\nConsistent demand for our sites.\nAs a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n•\nHigh lease renewal rates.\nOur tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings lost on this basis by our prior-year tenant billings. Historically, churn has averaged approximately 1% to 2% of tenant billings per year. During the year ended December 31, 2022, churn was approximately 5% of our tenant billings, primarily driven by churn in our U.S. & Canada property segment. We expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will continue to be elevated for a period of several years through 2025 due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile US, Inc. (“T-Mobile”), including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of our master lease agreement with T-Mobile (the “T-Mobile MLA”) entered into in September 2020.\n•\nHigh operating margins.\nIncremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants or equipment to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants or equipment are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets, certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base.\n•\nLow maintenance capital expenditures.\nOn average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites.\nOur property business includes the operation of communications sites and managed networks, the leasing of property interests  and, in select markets, the operation of fiber, the operation of data centers and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and long-term growth potential. Our property segments accounted for the following percentage of\n2\nconsolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31,:\nCommunications Sites.\nApproximately 89%, 95% and 95% of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites, excluding DAS networks, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, mobile video and a number of other applications. In addition, in many of our international markets, we receive pass-through revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs, including power and fuel costs and ground rent. Our top tenants by revenue for each property segment are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n•\nU.S. & Canada:\nAT&T Inc. (“AT&T”); T-Mobile; and Verizon Wireless accounted for an aggregate of 88% of U.S. & Canada property segment revenue.\n•\nAsia-Pacific:\nBharti Airtel Limited (“Airtel”); Reliance Jio; and VIL accounted for an aggregate of 90% of Asia-Pacific property segment revenue.\n•\nAfrica:\nAirtel; and MTN Group Limited (“MTN”) accounted for an aggregate of 78% of Africa property segment revenue.\n•\nEurope:\nTelefónica S.A. (“Telefónica”) accounted for an aggregate of 71% of Europe property segment revenue.\n•\nLatin America:\nAmérica Móvil; AT&T; Telefónica; and TIM S.p.A. accounted for an aggregate of 74% of Latin America property segment revenue.\nAccordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our current and projected revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.”\nAs further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” and “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” in the third quarter of 2022, VIL communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022 (the “VIL Shortfall”). In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. We considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under our tenant leases when conducting our annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and goodwill in India and, as a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired.\nAs a result of the challenging business environment in India, we are exploring various strategic alternatives aimed at potentially reducing our exposure there, including the sale of an equity interest in our India operations to one or more private investors. Any such completed transaction could have a material impact on our financial statements and on our results of operations in the period in which any such transaction occurred. There can be no assurance that any such strategic alternative will be implemented and, if so implemented, as to the timing thereof, and any such proposed transaction would be subject to conditions, including regulatory approvals in India.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.”\nManaged Networks, Fiber and Related Assets, Data Centers and Related Assets, Property Interests and Shared Generators.\nIn addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites, provide the right to use fiber, operate data center facilities and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites. The balance of our property segment revenue not attributable to our communications sites was attributable to these items.\n3\n•\nManaged Networks.\nWe own and operate DAS networks in the United States and certain international markets. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer a small portfolio of outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States and in certain international markets. Typically, we have designed, built and operated our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites, such as macro tower sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless services in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions, including small cells and other network architectures that may support our tenants’ networks in these areas.\n•\nFiber and Related Assets.\nWe own and operate fiber and related assets in certain international markets. We currently provide the right to use such fiber and related assets to communications and internet service providers and third-party operators to support their telecommunications infrastructure. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to invest selectively in and expand these and other similar assets in the future as part of advanced network deployments.\n•\nData Centers and Related Assets.\nAs a result of our recent data center acquisitions, we own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the United States, which consist of specialized and secure buildings that house networking, storage and communications technology infrastructure, including servers, storage devices, switches, routers and fiber optic transmission equipment. These buildings are designed to provide the power, cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate this equipment. Data centers located at points where many communications networks converge can also function as interconnection hubs where customers are able to connect to multiple networks, cloud companies and other service providers to exchange traffic and interoperate with each other.\n•\nProperty Interests\n.\nWe own portfolios of property interests in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, including land under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provide recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements.\n•\nShared Generators\n.\nWe have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators.\nServices Operations\nWe offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural analysis and construction management services. Our services operations primarily support our site leasing business, including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for 2%, 3% and 1% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSite Application, Zoning and Permitting\n. We engage in site application services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants’ engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants’ needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site.\nStructural Analysis.\nWe offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve on-air readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties.\nConstruction Management.\nWe offer construction management services to wireless carriers in connection with the deployment of their networks on our tower sites. Our construction management team oversees construction activities such as contractor sourcing, contractor selection and management, materials management, on-site quality control and closeout documentation for new installations or modifications. Our construction management capabilities enable us to provide efficient deployment to the carriers while ensuring that the construction work meets our quality control standards.\n4\nStrategy\nOperational Strategy\nAs wireless communications technologies advance and the use of wireless services on handsets, tablets and other advanced mobile devices grows, there is a corresponding increase in demand for the communications infrastructure required to facilitate ever growing network demand. To capture this demand, our primary operational focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity, (ii) invest in, and selectively grow, our communications real estate portfolio and service offerings, including through platform expansion initiatives, (iii) further improve our operational performance and efficiency and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts to meet our customers’ needs will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. In addition, we expect to explore new opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses, including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new customers, or to existing customers for new uses, and those that increase our operational efficiency.\n•\nIncrease the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio to support global connectivity.\nWe believe that our highest incremental returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers and other connectivity providers. As a result, we anticipate growing demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenants and equipment. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven by ongoing network densification initiatives as well as the early stages of multiple concurrent 5G network deployments. In our international markets, carriers are increasingly deploying more advanced network technologies such as 4G and, in the case of our international markets with more mature network technology, 5G, while continuing to selectively augment legacy networks. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites.\n•\nInvest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio to meet our customers’ needs.\nWe seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program, acquisitions and platform expansion initiatives. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. More recently, we have invested in strategic data center assets, including through the CoreSite Acquisition, which we believe can drive strong, recurring growth and also meaningfully enhance the value of our existing communications tower real estate through emerging edge compute opportunities in the future. We also expect to explore additional ways to use our platform expansion initiatives to enhance the efficiency of our operations over time.\n•\nFurther improve our operational performance and efficiency.\nWe continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service initiatives, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. We are also focused on developing and implementing renewable power solutions across our footprint to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help improve the overall efficiency of the communications infrastructure and wireless industries through our sustainability and power as a service (PaaS) initiatives.\n•\nMaintain a strong balance sheet.\nWe remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2022, had $7.1 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to continue to invest in growing and augmenting our business.\nCapital Allocation Strategy\nThe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations per share and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required annually to distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders. After complying with our REIT distribution requirements, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies.\n5\n•\nCapital expenditure program.\nWe expect to continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with site maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site and data center facility construction, land interest acquisitions and power solutions.\n•\nAcquisitions.\nWe intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of communications sites and other telecommunications infrastructure in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. The risk-adjusted hurdle rates used to evaluate acquisition opportunities consider additional factors such as the country and counterparties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk, among others.\n•\nReturn excess capital to stockholders\n. If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) the repayment of debt consistent with our financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition and select platform expansion opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders, including through our stock repurchase programs.\nInternational Growth Strategy\nWe believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others:\n•\nCountry analysis.\nPrior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the country’s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation and foreign currency exchange rate trends, demographics, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime.\n•\nWireless industry analysis.\nTo confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country’s wireless market. This includes an evaluation of the industry’s pricing environment, past and potential consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctions.\n•\nOpportunity and counterparty analysis.\nOnce an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region.\nRegulatory Matters\nTowers, Antennas and Fiber.\nOur U.S. and international tower leasing businesses are subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders.\nCertain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing, registration, permitting and public listings. In India, our subsidiary, ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited (“ATC TIPL”), holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I (“IP-I”) Registration Certificate issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. Additionally, in 2018, ATC TIPL issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. Although the debt is held by another subsidiary of ours and is eliminated in consolidation, ATC TIPL is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange.\nIn Asia-Pacific, our subsidiaries in the Philippines and Bangladesh are required to hold a registration or license in order to establish, manage and operate passive telecommunications infrastructure services.\n6\nOur subsidiaries in New Zealand are required to satisfy certain investment and reporting requirements. Specifically, our subsidiaries are required to invest $10 million in the aggregate in additional land interests under telecommunications assets in New Zealand by September 30, 2027, of which $5 million must be invested by September 30, 2025. Quarterly reporting for all acquisitions and dispositions is required to be provided to the Overseas Investment Office.\nIn Africa, our subsidiaries in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda are required to hold a license in order to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers. Additionally, in Uganda, our subsidiary is subject to review for three years commencing in 2020 by a monitoring trustee regarding compliance with certain conditions of approval of our acquisition in 2019 of Eaton Towers Holdings Limited.\nIn Latin America, our subsidiary in Chile holds a concession of intermediate telecommunications services and our subsidiary in Argentina holds an information and communications technology service license. In Peru, our subsidiaries are registered as infrastructure providers at the Ministry of Transport and Communications and in Colombia, our subsidiaries have a general authorization certificate for the provision of telecommunications networks and/or services. The subsidiaries that hold our fiber business in Mexico and Brazil are also licensed and regulated as concession holders and permit holders authorized to provide telecommunications services. In many of the markets in which we operate, we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a non-discriminatory basis, subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable terms. Additionally, in 2023, one of our Brazilian subsidiaries, American Tower do Brasil – Cessao de Infraestruturas S.A. (“ATC Brazil”) issued non-convertible debentures, which are listed on the Brazilian stock exchange. Although the non-convertible debentures are held by another subsidiary of ours and are eliminated in consolidation, ATC Brazil is still subject to the listing requirements of such exchange.\nOur international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the “BBBEE Act”) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In Kenya, our regulator requires all holders of a commercial license to issue at least 30% of their shares to Kenyans within three years of receiving the license unless a waiver is obtained to extend such period of compliance by a year. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers and certain regional and other governmental bodies have sought to impose levies or other forms of fees. Our foreign operations may be affected if a country’s regulatory authority restricts, revokes or modifies spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership.\nIn all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. This opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications or additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects. Further, additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us or changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. These factors could materially and adversely affect our operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations.\nPortions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we, or our customers, may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites.\nData Centers\n. Our U.S. data center facilities and related assets are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) federal requirements. If one of our properties is not in compliance with these regulations, we may be required to make significant unanticipated expenditures in order to comply with such regulations and/or pay fines or civil damage awards. Existing regulations may subsequently change\n7\nor future regulations may be enacted, either of which could have a similar impact as described above, and could materially and adversely affect our operations.\nEnvironmental Matters.\nOur U.S. and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes, the siting of our towers and the maintenance of our data center facilities. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our tower sites and/or data center facilities. When a site is decommissioned, we are required to follow applicable regulatory requirements, including by following decommissioning procedures and environmental management plans. With respect to our data center facilities, the presence of contamination, asbestos, mold or other air quality issues or the failure to remediate contamination, asbestos, mold or other air quality issues at our facilities may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions.\nAdditionally, in the United States and in other countries where we operate, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed or modifications to the site construction plans may be necessary.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, some of the states and localities in which we operate and the governments of other countries in which we operate have also enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions and may adopt new regulations related to the use of fossil fuels or requiring the use of alternative fuel or renewable energy sources to power energy resources that serve our data centers. Efforts to support and enhance renewable electricity generation may increase our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred through procurement of conventional electricity. Our data centers require and consume significant amounts of power, including electricity generated by the burning of fossil fuels. These laws, regulations and stakeholder requests could limit our ability to develop new facilities or result in substantial compliance, maintenance, repair, retrofit and construction costs, including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. Changes in regulations that affect electric power providers, such as regulations related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change-related matters, could adversely affect the costs of electric power and increase our operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations or those of our customers.\nHealth and Safety.\nIn the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure and air quality issues. Additionally, and in response to various national, state and local laws and guidance enacted in response to the ongoing coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, we implemented work-from-home arrangements and travel restrictions for our employees where practicable, as well as and other modifications to our business practices.\nCompetition\nOur industry is highly competitive. We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and Cellnex Telecom, S.A., wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, carrier-affiliated tower companies, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. Our data center business also competes with a variety of companies offering similar data center solutions and services, including space, power, interconnection and development services. We believe that location and capacity, network and/or interconnection density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites and data center facilities.\nOur services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site application consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, construction management firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants’ personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria, including a company’s experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project.\n8\nFor more information on demand trends in our industry, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.”\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed 6,391 full-time individuals, including 2,375 employees based in the United States and 4,016 employees based internationally. Our teams in our nearly 30 countries around the world are our most important assets and fundamental to our success. Aligned with our business strategy, our human capital management strategy focuses on developing and delivering solutions to attract, develop, engage and retain top diverse talent in each of the countries where we operate. We consider our employee relations to be good. Our Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer regularly report to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, respectively, on our initiatives related to human capital management.\nEmployee Engagement\n. In 2022, our employees participated in several surveys related to our company-wide sustainability efforts, our internal communications and how we measure up against our targeted values. We also solicited, and responded to, feedback from our employees regarding our return-to-office policies. Across the globe, most of our employees now work on a hybrid schedule.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental considerations and values for us in conducting business. A critical factor in our success is ensuring that each of these remains at the core of our business culture, infusing fresh ideas, helping us remain connected to our customers in a dynamic global market and ensuring mutual respect guides us in our interactions both internally and externally. We have adopted a Global Human Rights Statement, which can be found on our website.\nOur Board of Directors is a diverse group with respect to traditional diversity metrics such as gender, race and national origin, as well as professional background and skills, with five members of our board identifying as female and four identifying as part of a minority group. We are also committed to ensuring diverse representation among our employees. In 2022, 35% of all employees promoted globally were female, which is greater than the female representation in our workforce of 29%. And as of December 31, 2022, nearly 35% of management-level positions in the United States were also held by women. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the “EEOC”) requires employers to submit an EEO-1 report on an annual basis. The report breaks down an employer’s workforce by race, ethnicity and gender across job categories established by the EEOC. We publish the EEO-1 reports on our website, which provides transparency for our stakeholders to better understand our diversity and workforce practices, and helps us identify areas for growth as we continue strengthening our diversity efforts and initiatives.\nAdditionally, we have implemented several initiatives designed to help address social injustice and enhance our diversity. These include pledges from the American Tower Foundation of (i) $1.0 million for grants to organizations around the globe, recommended by our Social Justice Committee, supporting charitable organizations that are promoting racial equity and enhancing the American Tower Foundation’s work on social justice and (ii) a total of $1.0 million for scholarship funds at two Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In 2022, our Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer continued to lead our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy by introducing new initiatives and best practices, including working with each region to develop relevant representation, development and recruitment goals and updating employees on a company-wide resource center. With the oversight of our Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, we developed our first employee resource group, Women and Allies of American Tower Climb Higher (“WAATCH”), in our U.S. and Latin America offices, to promote better employee connection and collaboration. WAATCH focuses on mentorship, networking and working with the local communities on charitable initiatives.\nTalent Development and Recruitment.\nAs a critical investment in our capacity to provide our customers with outstanding support and customer service, we offer a variety of development opportunities unique to each market to cultivate our talent throughout our global organization. For individual contributors, we have 9,600 resources in up to five languages that focus on job-specific training and general topics, such as productivity, collaboration and project management. We create and customize courses to meet regional needs and update these courses regularly to address changing marketplace dynamics and employee interests.\nDeveloping our managers is critical to our success, and over 39,000 resources and tools are provided to all levels of management. For example, our management development programs provide continuous learning opportunities through training led by American Tower leaders. Managers learn tools and best practices that enable both management and team success, and that build and strengthen competencies to better respond to the needs of a growing and increasingly complex organization. Our annual Advanced Leadership Development program, in collaboration with the INSEAD executive education program, provides\n9\nour next generation leaders in Latin America, Europe, the U.S. and Africa with a twelve-week intensive workshop to enhance management and leadership skills. The Leadership Excellence at American Tower program supports global senior leaders’ development through its partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Participants learn from leading experts on topics like global strategy and leading in uncertain times. For our U.S. employees in underrepresented groups who are considered emerging leaders, we offer The Power of Choice program. This development opportunity, which is a blend of in-person and virtual sessions, is designed to support these employees through a career path journey. We also have a comprehensive talent-management review process to develop future leaders and ensure effective succession planning.\nOur recruiting efforts consistently include strategies to build diverse candidate pipelines and promote a culture that supports a diverse team of global employees. We are proud of our Leadership Development Program, which provides a recruitment opportunity for business school students, who are able to learn about different aspects of our business through regular rotational assignments. Further, with respect to our Leadership Development Program, as of December 31, 2022, 56% of our hires identified as part of a minority group and 44% identified as female. We have also continued our recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as other recruiting efforts to build a diverse talent pipeline.\nOur Compensation Committee also approved a shared human capital management goal for the entire executive team for 2022, which focuses on developing talent, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups.\nWorkplace Safety.\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and surrounding communities. Depending on the role, team members are required to pass and complete regular safety training courses and follow specific tower and site safety protocols with the support of operational manuals. A key component of our culture is a strong commitment to incident reporting and corrective actions, as well as a comprehensive program for ensuring vendor compliance with safety standards and certifications. Our strict adherence to the rigorous standards set forth by the relevant government agencies and other authorities, such as the Telecommunications Infrastructure Registered Apprenticeship Program and Telecommunications Industry Association, is critical to ensuring our towers are structurally safe for field personnel, vendors, customers and communities. In 2022, our Chief Security Officer implemented several employee safety and security protocols. In 2022, our Chief Security Officer led the production of enhanced security standards to better protect our people and assets worldwide. These include global standards for the security of international travelers and personnel ground movements. We also implemented a traveler assistance program that allows us to better monitor international travel and provide employees with relevant trip advice and 24/7 assistance services.\nHealth and Wellness.\nWe offer medical and parental leave benefits to full-time employees across all markets, with some local variation. As a result of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conduct wellness check-ins and offer resources to support our employees’ mental health and well-being, including access to a free Employee Assistance Program, which offers confidential assistance on a wide range of issues. We also offer market competitive benefits in all locations and, in 2022, continued our behavioral health benefit in the United States to support employees’ mental well-being.\nExecutive Officers\nFor information about our Executive Officers, see Item 10 of this Annual Report under the caption “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”\nAvailable Information\nOur internet website address is\nwww.americantower.com\n.

    "text": "Risks Related to Our Business Strategy\nA significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand.\nA significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include:\n•\nincreased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of communications service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or communications service providers;\n•\nthe financial condition of communications service providers;\n•\nzoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof;\n•\ngovernmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our customers’ spectrum licenses;\n•\na decrease in demand for wireless or colocation services, including due to general economic conditions, disruption in the financial and credit markets or global social, political or health crises, such as the material adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and markets, inflation, slowing growth, rising interest rates or recession;\n•\nthe ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure;\n•\ndelays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and\n•\ntechnological changes.\nA substantial portion of our current and projected future revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.\nA substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of customers. If any of these customers are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our growth projections are based on future revenue from a small number of customers, and such projections could be adversely impacted by adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.\nOne or more of our customers, or their parent companies, may experience financial difficulties, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations as a result of a prolonged economic downturn, economic difficulties (including those from the imposition of taxes, fees, regulations or judicial interpretations of regulations, and any associated penalties or interest, which may be substantial) or otherwise. The current inflationary and high interest rate environment could materially and adversely affect our customers through disruptions of, among other things, their ability to procure their equipment through their supply chains, their ability to procure power and fuel and their ability to maintain liquidity and deploy network capital, with potential decreases in consumer spending contributing to liquidity risks. Such financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. The loss of significant customers, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur largest customer in India is VIL, which represented approximately 3.2% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In the third quarter of 2022, VIL communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. We considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under our tenant leases when conducting our annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and goodwill in India. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million. For more information on impairments in India, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”\n11\nincluded in this Annual Report. For more information on revenue reserves related to the VIL Shortfall, please see the information under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Results of Operation\" included in this Annual Report. Continued partial payments from VIL could have further negative effects on our fixed assets, intangible assets or goodwill, could result in additional impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn October 2022, and as subsequently amended in February 2023, ATC TIPL and VIL notified the stock exchange of India that both parties have board approvals in relation to an issuance of convertible debentures pursuant to which, in exchange for VIL’s payment of certain amounts towards accounts receivables, ATC TIPL shall pay equivalent amounts towards subscription to convertible debentures issued by VIL. The convertible debentures are to be repaid by VIL with interest and ATC TIPL has the option to convert the debentures into equity of VIL. The issuance of the debentures is subject to certain conditions precedent, which may not be met. VIL may not be able to meet its operating obligations, including making payments to us in the future,\nwhich may result in us incurring additional impairment expenses or other similar charges,\nand which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDue to the long-term nature of our customer leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our customers. Many communications service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. In our international operations, many of our customers are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. These subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities.\nIn addition, many of our customers and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets, such as the current environment driven by the significant disruptions caused by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. If our customers or potential customers are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, file for bankruptcy or reduce or terminate operations, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications infrastructure and our services business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. Historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our relationships with our customers. However, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with those customers, a material adverse modification of the terms of those leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those customers that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nSignificant consolidation among our customers could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. Certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other customers could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases or related payments with us. In the event a customer terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum, we may experience increased churn as a result. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. For example, see our discussion of churn as a result of the T-Mobile MLA in our U.S. & Canada property segment in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview.”\nIn addition, extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers, including due to increases in advanced network technology such as 5G, as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the customers’ networks may become redundant.\nIncreasing competition within our industry may materially and adversely affect our revenue.\nOur industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives in leasing communications infrastructure assets. Competition due to pricing or alternative contractual arrangements from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. We may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases, or if we are able to renew\n12\nor enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates or on less favorable terms than our current terms, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate.\nOur expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk.\nAs we continue to acquire and build communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets, including data center facilities and related assets, in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention. Achieving the benefits of acquisition and platform expansion initiatives depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, conflicting policies, procedures and operations. Significant acquisition-related integration costs, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees, integrating information technology systems, acquiring permits and visiting, inspecting, engineering and upgrading tower sites or other communications infrastructure assets, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. Some of our acquired portfolios have included sites that do not meet our structural specifications, including sites that may be overburdened. In these cases, beyond additional capital expenditures, general liability risks associated with such portfolios will exist until such time as those portfolios are upgraded or otherwise remedied. In addition, integration may significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks, such as those described above, as well as our ability to comply with bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar local laws.\nMoreover, we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity. If we are not able to meet these integration challenges, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nFor example, failure to successfully and efficiently operate and expand acquired assets from the CoreSite Acquisition may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We must safeguard our customers’ infrastructure and equipment located in our data centers and ensure our data centers remain operational at all times. Problems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant infrastructure or equipment damage. These could result from numerous factors, including energy cost and availability, human error, equipment failure, physical, electronic and cyber security breaches, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, extreme temperatures, water damage, fiber cuts, power loss, terrorist acts, sabotage and vandalism, global pandemics or health emergencies and failure of business partners.\nWe have service level commitment obligations to substantially all of our data center customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. Because our data centers are critical to many of our customers’ businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. In addition, any loss of service, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Furthermore, we are dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and utility providers, some of which have experienced significant system failures and outages in the past. Our customers may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and offerings. If, for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. If, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable or the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge in the period the determination is made.\nOur platform expansion initiatives may not be successful, or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, and could limit our continued investments in such platform expansion initiatives.\n13\nIn addition, as we continue to invest in partnership opportunities to support our expansion initiatives, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could present governance challenges with multiple partners or expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that partnership or to execute buyouts of their interests.\nNew technologies or changes, or lack thereof, in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.\nThe development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a customer’s business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. In addition, if the industry trends toward deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies, then customers may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers. Examples of these technologies include more spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our customers’ network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. Additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies or satellite services could shift a portion of our customers’ network investments away from traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites.\nMoreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. Further, a customer may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. Similarly, our data center site infrastructure may become antiquated due to the development of new systems that deliver power to, or eliminate heat from, the servers and other customer equipment that we house or the development of new technology that requires levels of power and cooling density that our facilities are not designed to provide. Our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a customer’s business model could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business, results of operations or financial condition. Conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies, platform expansion initiatives or new additions to our core business that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAdditionally, our customers may overestimate or overvalue the benefits and use of 5G networks and other new technology that are deployed onto our communications sites that, in turn, could adversely affect our customers' growth, thereby adversely affecting our growth.\nCompetition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria.\nWe may experience increased competition for the acquisition of communications infrastructure assets or contracts to build new communications infrastructure assets for customers, which could make the acquisition of high-quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. Some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria or less stringent contractual terms than we do. In addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. Higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our data center competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, lower operating costs, lower levels of leverage, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, greater financial, marketing and other resources, access to better networks and access to less expensive power. These advantages could allow our data center competitors to respond more quickly or effectively to strategic opportunities and as a result, we may lose existing or potential data center customers, incur costs to improve our properties or be forced to reduce our rental rates. These risks are compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our data center customer leases expire every year.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance or General Economic Conditions\nOur leverage and debt service obligations, including during a rising interest rates environment, may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations, including as a result of our recent CoreSite Acquisition, could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:\n14\n•\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and REIT distributions;\n•\nimpairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured;\n•\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\nWe may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, required purchases of our partners’ interests and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations and leverage requirements, including financial ratio covenants. An increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants, which could accelerate our debt repayment obligations. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nFurther, market volatility and disruption caused by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt and equity financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations, which in turn may have an adverse impact on our credit ratings. The Federal Reserve Board began to raise interest rates in March 2022 for the first time in over three years, significantly increased the federal funds rate during 2022 and has indicated that further rate increases may be announced in the short-term to combat rising inflation in the United States. Such rate increases have corresponding impact to our costs of borrowing and may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise funds through the offering of our securities or through the issuance of debt due to higher debt capital costs, diminished credit availability and less favorable equity markets. Any significant additional federal fund rate increases may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The extent to which these factors will impact our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation.\nRising inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\nThe United States and other large global economies experienced historically high inflation during 2022, which has continued into the beginning of 2023. The Federal Reserve Board and other central banks already have raised interest rates more aggressively and to their highest levels in the last four to five decades. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, supply chain disruptions, governmental stimulus or fiscal policies, as well as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Inflation can materially adversely affect us by increasing the costs of land, materials, labor and other costs required to manage and grow our business. In addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our returns could be adversely\naffected. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation or our customers may be unwilling to pay contractual increases, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. If we are unable to increase our prices to offset the effects of inflation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Rising inflation rates have also contributed to foreign currency exchange rate volatility, including in several of the markets where we operate. The ongoing impact of inflation may continue to create foreign exchange rate instability in our international markets that could, in turn, depress the value of that market’s currency, thereby adversely impacting our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve Board and other central banks have recently raised interest rates aggressively, to their highest levels in the last four to five decades. The combination of higher interest rates and high inflation could lead to an extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results of operations and financial condition even after these conditions improve.\n15\nRestrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nThe agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. A failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. If the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets.\nThe agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required REIT distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. Additionally, our credit facilities restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. These covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower or other communications infrastructure development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. Our credit agreements also contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions, which may be triggered if we default on certain indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds. In the event of such a default, the resulting cross-defaults or cross-accelerations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. For more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nWe also enter into hedges for certain debt instruments, which may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined or the use of alternative reference rates.\nThe United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced plans to phase out certain LIBOR rates by June 2023. As contemplated, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be assured after June 2023, and LIBOR will cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for benchmarking. While our bank facilities contain fallback provisions to establish an alternative rate in the event LIBOR is unavailable, the elimination of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Financial institutions may replace LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). In April 2018, the United States Federal Reserve commenced publishing SOFR; however, SOFR is calculated differently from LIBOR and has inherent differences, which could give rise to uncertainties, including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates. No consensus exists as to what may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before June 2023 or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Furthermore, the use of an alternative rate could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense, and increased borrowing and hedging costs in the future. We cannot predict the effect of the FCA’s decision not to sustain LIBOR or, if changes ultimately are made to LIBOR, the effect those changes may have on our interest expense related to borrowings under our bank facilities, certain other debt service obligations and interest swap agreements, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nOur business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.\nOur business, and that of our customers, is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, treaties and regulations and administrative and judicial decisions. In certain jurisdictions, these regulations, laws and treaties could be applied or be enforced retroactively. Zoning authorities and community organizations are sometimes opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demands.\n16\nExisting or new regulatory policies, regulations or laws may materially and adversely affect the timing, cost or completion of our communications sites or result in changes in the competitive landscape that may negatively affect our business. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to litigants or result in decreased revenue. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we and certain of our customers are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. Governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal and additional conditions to receive or maintain such license. Additionally, we have government customers for several of our communications sites and data centers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\nFurthermore, the tax laws, regulations, applicable license terms and conditions, and interpretations governing our business, and that of our customers, in jurisdictions where we operate, may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an impact on our financial results. This includes changes in tax laws, transfer pricing regulations, spectrum use terms, administrative compliance guidance or judicial interpretations thereof. For example, the definition and application of adjusted gross revenue (“AGR”) in India and associated fees and charges may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Changes in laws, regulations and judicial decisions, such as the ongoing Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) legislative developments regarding global minimum tax rules, could have a more significant impact on us as a REIT relative to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries. These factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur international business operations and our potential expansion into additional new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n•\nuncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications infrastructure or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay;\n•\nfailure to retain our tax status or to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied;\n•\nexpropriation resulting in government takeover of customer operations or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture;\n•\nlaws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;\n•\nchanges in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation;\n•\nchanges to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications infrastructure;\n•\nactions restricting or revoking our customers’ spectrum licenses, or alterations or interpretations thereof, or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses;\n•\nfailure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the Office of Foreign Assets Control requirements;\n•\nfailure to comply with data privacy laws or other protections of employee health and personal information;\n•\nmaterial site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids;\n17\n•\nsignificant increases in, or implementation of new, license surcharges on our revenue;\n•\nloss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and\n•\nprice-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure.\nWe also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from the impacts of the current inflationary and high interest rate environment on the global economy and markets and those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. Our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. We have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-U.S. Dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income.\nWe may be adversely affected by regulations related to climate change.\nEfforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, the use of fossil fuels or requirement to use alternative fuel to power energy resources that serve our data centers or the generators we use in our emerging markets to deliver primary power to our customers may have direct or indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of compliance. In addition, there is an increased focus by many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders regarding environmental and energy policies relating to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related matters. These governmental initiatives are becoming more stringent and may require us and our customers to make capital expenditures, such as investing in renewable energy solutions or internal compliance systems, which would result in increased costs for us and our customers. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other requirements imposed on us could also lead to fines and/or lost revenue.\nIn 2021, we adopted science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, which were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and are in line with the goals set forth in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Our ability to achieve these goals are based on several factors, some of which are outside of our control including changing regulatory requirements, the pace of changes in technology and the availability of requisite financing. In addition, to meet our goals, we may be required to expend significant resources to meet them, which could increase our operational costs. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, consumers’ perceptions of our efforts to achieve these goals often differ widely and present risks to our reputation and brand. Failing to meet these goals could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation with our key stakeholders, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations, reputation, financial condition and stock price.\nIf we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow.\nCommencing with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Qualification for taxation as a REIT requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. There are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the Code.\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:\n•\nwe will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders and would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, which could be substantial in amount, and may require us to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability and, accordingly, may reduce funds available for other purposes; and\n•\nwe will be disqualified from REIT tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified.\nWe are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. While state and local income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many of these jurisdictions differ in their treatment of REITs. For example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a REIT’s deduction for dividends\n18\npaid, which could increase our income tax expense. We are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. The results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.\nFurthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary REITs, which must also comply with the same REIT requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. If the subsidiary REIT is determined to have failed to qualify for taxation as a REIT and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary REIT would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. In addition, our ownership of shares in such subsidiary REIT would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.\nOur use of TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of the assets of the REIT may be represented by non-qualifying assets (including securities of one or more TRSs). This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments or take advantage of acquisition opportunities, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy.\nFurther, as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). To meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. As no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our TRSs to fund other investments.\nIn addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our TRSs are generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.\nWe could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. We may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. Many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. We may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. Further, our data center properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations and ADA federal requirements. We may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements.\nThe requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. In certain jurisdictions, these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. While we maintain environmental and workers’ compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\n19\nOur towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage or result in increased insurance premiums.\nOur towers, fiber networks, data centers and computer systems are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, such as hurricanes, ice and windstorms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wildfires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as the potential adverse effects of pandemics and acts of terrorism. During the past several years, we have seen an increase in severe weather events and expect this trend to continue due to climate change. Further, environmental liabilities, such as contamination, asbestos-containing building materials and mold or other air quality issues at some of our data centers, could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance.\nAny damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers, fiber networks, data centers or computer systems may cause supply chain delays or impact our ability to provide services to our customers and lead to customer loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition and also, our communications sites could be subject to attacks instigated by claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage for certain natural disasters, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites or fiber for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new customers that could have been added to our towers, fiber networks or data centers but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event, such was wildfire damage caused by our towers. Further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nIf we, or third parties on which we rely, experience technology failures, including cybersecurity incidents or the loss of personally identifiable information, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include reputational damage.\nAs part of our normal business activities, including in our data centers, we rely on energy systems, cooling systems, communication networks, information technology and other computing resources. We may be vulnerable to physical or cybersecurity breaches that could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We face risks associated with unauthorized access to our or our vendors’ computer systems, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses, malware, distributed denial-of-service attacks or other malicious activities. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our or our vendors’ networks or the security of our communications infrastructure could misappropriate either our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers or our employees, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers’ operations. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security.\nGlobally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends may continue, especially during times of geopolitical tension or instability among countries, including, for example, the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, from which a number of recent cybersecurity events have been alleged to have originated. Such cyber-attacks could be in the form of espionage, phishing campaigns and otherwise. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents. As techniques used to breach security grow in frequency and sophistication, and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we, or our vendors, may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred or implement security measures in a timely manner. If and when implemented, we, or our vendors, may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, damage relating to loss of proprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We offer managed services in certain of our data centers where we provide “remote hands” services for our customers. The access to our customers’ networks and data, which is gained from these services, creates some risk that our customers’ networks or data will be improperly accessed. If we were held responsible for any such breach, it could result in a significant loss to us, including damage to our customer relationships, harm to our brand and reputation and legal liability. Additionally, while we maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity incidents, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs in the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, and we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks.\n20\nAlthough we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, breached or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations, including our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information, our customers’ network availability may be impacted or we could unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our customers or landlords, or customer information on our fiber, data center or managed networks businesses), which could result in a loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, damage to our customer and vendor relationships, litigation, regulatory investigations and penalties under existing or future data privacy laws and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues.\nOur costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated.\nPublic perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks, including claims that the deployment of 5G networks is linked to adverse health effects, could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. If a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our customers and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.\nIf we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time, we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe do not own the buildings for all of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all, though we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases when the primary terms of the leases expire. Failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset any potential increase in lease costs, including as a result of the current inflationary environment, would adversely impact our operating income. We could also lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by our inability to renew our data center leases.\nAdditionally, we rely on our landlords for basic maintenance of our leased data centers. If such landlords have not maintained our leased properties sufficiently, we may be forced into an early exit from one or more of these data centers, which could be disruptive to our business.\nIf we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period, our cash flows derived from those towers will be eliminated.\nOur communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. We may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. If we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers."

    "text": "21\nAs of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated a portfolio of 224,768 communications sites, including 1,713 DAS networks. See the table in Item 7 of this Annual Report, under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Overview” for more detailed information on the geographic locations of our communications sites. In addition, we own property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators in Canada and the United States, which are included in our U.S. & Canada property segment, and in Australia and New Zealand, which are included in our Asia-Pacific property segment, and also own and operate data center facilities and related assets in the United States, which are included in our Data Centers segment.\nOur interests in our communications sites consist of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities.\nA typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure and, in some cases, one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. In addition, many of our international sites typically include power generators and batteries, which are often used for primary power in lieu of an electric grid connection in select markets. The principal types of our towers are guyed, self-supporting lattice and monopole, and rooftop towers in our international markets.\n•\nA guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground and can reach heights of up to 2,000 feet. A typical guyed broadcast tower can be located a tract of land of up to 20 acres.\n•\nA self-supporting lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1,000 feet, although most lattice structures are between 200 and 400 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site can be located on a tract of land of 10,000 square feet for a rural site or fewer than 2,500 square feet for a metropolitan site.\n•\nA monopole tower is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site used in metropolitan areas for a typical wireless communications tower can be located on a tract of land of fewer than 2,500 square feet.\n•\nRooftop towers are primarily used in metropolitan areas in our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, where locations for traditional tower structures are unavailable. Rooftop towers typically have heights ranging from 10 to 100 feet.\nU.S. & Canada Property Segment Encumbered Sites\n. As of December 31, 2022, the loan underlying the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 and March 2018 (the “2013 Securitization” and the “2018 Securitization”, respectively, and together, the “Trust Securitizations”) is secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan on substantially all of the 5,102 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets owned by the borrowers (the “Trust Sites”) and the secured revenue notes issued in a private transaction completed in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) are secured by mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 3,516 communications sites owned by subsidiaries of the issuer (the “2015 Secured Sites”).\nThere are no encumbered sites in our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe or Latin America property segments or in our Data Centers segment.\nGround Leases.\nOf the 223,055 towers in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, approximately 90% were located on land we lease. Typically, we seek to enter long-term ground leases, which have initial terms of approximately five to ten years with one or more automatic or exercisable renewal periods. As a result, 43% of the ground leases for our sites have a final expiration date of 2032 and beyond.\nCustomers\n. Our customers are primarily wireless service providers, broadcasters and other companies in a variety of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top three customers by total revenue were T-Mobile (18%), AT&T (17%) and Verizon Wireless (11%).\nAcross most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. As a result, approximately 56% of our current tenant leases have a renewal date of 2028 or beyond.\nData Centers.\nWe own and operate data center facilities and related assets, and as of December 31, 2022, our data center portfolio consisted of 28 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, across 3.1 million net rentable square feet (“NRSF”).\nOffices.\nOur principal corporate headquarters is leased and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we currently lease approximately 40,000 square feet of office space. We also own or have entered into long-term leases for the majority of our\n22\nfacilities in international and regional locations for the management and operation of our property and services businesses, including offices in each of our U.S. & Canada, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe, Latin America and Data Centers segments. Our international headquarters is leased and located in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs."

As of February 16, 2023, we had 465,646,055 outstanding shares of common stock and 137 holders of record.\nDividends\nAs a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of net operating losses (\n“\nNOLs\n”\n).\nThe amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nPerformance Graph\nThis performance graph is furnished and shall not be deemed ‘‘filed’’ with the SEC or subject to Section 18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index, the Dow Jones U.S. Telecommunications Equipment Index and the FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs Index.

The performance of our common stock reflected below is not necessarily indicative of future performance.\n24\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In December 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock (the “2017 Buyback”, and together with the 2011 Buyback the “Buyback Programs”).\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased a total of 90,042 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $18.8 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. There were no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback. The table below sets forth details of our repurchases under the 2011 Buyback during the three months ended December 31, 2022.\n_______________\n(1)     Repurchases made pursuant to the 2011 Buyback.\n(2)     Average price paid per share is a weighted average calculation using the aggregate price, excluding commissions and fees.\n(3)     Remaining under the 2011 Buyback.\nWe have repurchased a total of 14,451,325 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to our having available cash to fund repurchases.\nUnder the Buyback Programs, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time."

    "text": "The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below.\nWe report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).\nExecutive Overview\nWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and includes our U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment.\nWe also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.\n26\nThe following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2022:\n_______________\n(1)\nApproximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options.\n(2)\nWe also control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites in Australia and New Zealand, which provide recurring cash flows through tenant leasing arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our property portfolio included 28 operating data center facilities across ten markets in the United States that collectively comprise approximately 3.1 million NRSF of data center space, as detailed below:\n27\n_______________\n(1)\nExcludes approximately 0.4 million of office and light-industrial NRSF acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition.\nIn most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2022 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.\nBased upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, we expect to generate over $62 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\nFollowing the court rulings by the Supreme Court of India regarding carriers’ obligations for the AGR fees and charges prescribed by such court, we continue to experience variability and a level of uncertainty in collections in India. As further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our current and projected revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers,” in the third quarter of 2022, our largest customer in India, VIL, communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments.\nWe considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under our tenant leases when conducting our annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and goodwill in India. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million. We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information on impairments in India,\nplease see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”\nincluded in this Annual Report.\nIn October 2022, and as subsequently amended in February 2023, ATC TIPL and VIL notified the stock exchange of India that both parties have board approvals in relation to an issuance of convertible debentures pursuant to which, in exchange for VIL’s payment of certain amounts towards accounts receivables, ATC TIPL shall pay equivalent amounts towards subscription to convertible debentures issued by VIL. The convertible debentures are to be repaid by VIL with interest and ATC TIPL has the option to convert the debentures into equity of VIL. The issuance of the debentures is subject to certain conditions precedent, which may not be met.\nAs a result of the challenging business environment in India, we are exploring various strategic alternatives aimed at potentially reducing our exposure there, including the sale of an equity interest in our India operations to one or more private investors. Any such completed transaction could have a material impact on our financial statements and on our results of operations in the period in which any such transaction occurred. There can be no assurance that any such strategic alternative will be implemented and, if so implemented, as to the timing thereof, and any such proposed transaction would be subject to conditions, including regulatory approvals in India.\n28\nThe revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.\nRevenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, churn was approximately 5% of our tenant billings, primarily driven by churn in our U.S. & Canada property segment, as discussed below.\nWe expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will remain elevated for a period of several years through 2025 due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA entered into in September 2020.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nProperty Operations Revenue Growth\n. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.\nThe primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:\n•\nGrowth in tenant billings, including:\n•\nNew revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments;\n•\nContractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and\n•\nNew revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.\n•\nRevenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations on existing leases, mark-to-market increases on renewing leases and increased interconnection services and solutions.\n•\nRevenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.\nWe continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives.\nProperty Operations Organic Revenue Growth\n. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites.\nBased on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:\n•\nIn less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their\n29\nnetworks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.\n•\nSubscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.\n•\nThe deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.\n•\nWireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage.\n•\nWireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. We expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higher-band spectrum such as 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and C-Band being deployed for 5G, as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lower-band spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers.\n•\nNext generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages.\n•\nContinued data growth and emerging high-performance, latency-sensitive applications will drive an increased need for reliable, secure and interconnected data center solutions. We believe these trends will result in incremental utilization and interconnection demand at our data center facilities.\nAs part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.\nIn emerging markets, such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate.\nIn India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure that is more constructive for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure over the long-term.\nIn markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa, Poland and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network deployments. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.\nFinally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, France, New Zealand and Spain, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their\n30\ncustomer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity, as well as the early stages of 5G deployment.\nWe believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 182,000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long\n-\nterm growth.\nWe have master lease agreements with many of our tenants for our communications sites that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.\nDemand for our communications infrastructure assets could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our customers, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our customers may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications infrastructure assets.\nProperty Operations New Site Revenue Growth.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 7,405 communications sites globally. In a majority of our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.\nIn 2021, we significantly grew our portfolio of data center facilities through the acquisition of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in the United States, including through the CoreSite Acquisition.\nProperty Operations Expenses.\nDirect operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.\nServices Segment Revenue Growth\n. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues.\n31\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.\nNareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends to noncontrolling interests, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).”\nWe define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax and other income tax adjustments; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures.\nWe define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).”\nAdjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.\nOur measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.\n32\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nFor a discussion of our 2021 Results of Operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022 (the “2021 Form 10-K”).\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021\n(in millions, except percentages)\nRevenue\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nU.S. & Canada property segment revenue growth of $86.1 million was attributable to:\n•\nTenant billings growth of $47.9 million, which was driven by:\n◦\n$148.7 million due to colocations and amendments;\n◦\nPartially offset by:\n▪\nA decrease of $92.5 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations (as discussed above, we expect that our churn rate will be elevated for a period of several years due to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA);\n▪\nA decrease of $6.3 million from other tenant billings; and\n▪\nA decrease of $2.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, which includes the impact of the disposition of certain operations acquired in connection with our acquisition of InSite Wireless Group, LLC (“InSite,” and the acquisition, the “InSite Acquisition”); and\n▪\nAn increase of $38.7 million in other revenue, which includes a $35.4 million increase due to straight-line accounting.\nSegment revenue growth included a decrease of $0.5 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Canadian Dollar.\nAsia-Pacific property segment revenue decrease of $122.1 million was attributable to:\n•\nA decrease of $78.3 million in other revenue, primarily due to revenue reserves of $52.5 million related to the VIL Shortfall (as discussed above) and a decrease of $13.1 million due to straight-line accounting, primarily related to a write off of VIL balances; and\n•\nA decrease of $21.3 million in pass-through revenue, primarily due to revenue reserves of $42.0 million related to the VIL Shortfall, partially offset by an increase in fuel prices;\n•\nPartially offset by tenant billings growth of $39.6 million, which was driven by:\n◦\n$35.8 million due to colocations and amendments; and\n◦\n$23.3 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites;\n◦\nPartially offset by:\n▪\nA decrease of $18.9 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations; and\n▪\nA decrease of $0.6 million from other tenant billings.\nSegment revenue decline included a decrease of $62.1 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Indian Rupee (“INR”).\nAfrica property segment revenue growth of $187.0 million was attributable to:\n33\n•\nAn increase of $185.3 million in pass-through revenue, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices;\n•\nTenant billings growth of $100.6 million, which was driven by:\n◦\n$55.4 million due to colocations and amendments;\n◦\n$44.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites;\n◦\n$1.0 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and\n◦\n$0.2 million from other tenant billings; and\n•\nAn increase of $26.2 million in other revenue, which includes an increase due to straight-line accounting and a decrease in revenue reserves.\nSegment revenue growth included a decrease of $125.1 million attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation, which included, among others, negative impacts of $69.1 million related to fluctuations in Ghanaian Cedi, $17.8 million related to fluctuations in South African Rand, $14.2 million related to fluctuations in Nigerian Naira, $10.3 million related to fluctuations in West African CFA Franc and $9.3 million related to fluctuations in Kenyan Shilling.\nEurope property segment revenue growth of $239.5 million was attributable to:\n•\nTenant billings growth of $185.7 million, which was driven by:\n◦\n$158.1 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily attributable to our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of the VIL Shortfall is reflected in revenue reserves as described above.\n•\nThe increase in our Africa property segment SG&A was primarily driven by increased personnel costs to support our business and higher canceled construction costs.\n•\nThe increase in our Latin America property segment SG&A was primarily driven by increased personnel costs to support our business, including as a result of the Telxius Acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of\n$11.0 million.\n•\nThe increase in our Data Centers segment SG&A was attributable to data centers acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021, including through the CoreSite Acquisition.\n•\nThe increase in other SG&A was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $49.8 million, including expense associated with certain equity awards related to the CoreSite Acquisition, and an increase in corporate SG&A, including an increase in personnel costs to support our business.\nOperating Profit\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n•\nThe increases in operating profit for our U.S. & Canada, Africa, Europe and Latin America property segments were primarily attributable to increases in our segment gross margin, partially offset by increases in our segment SG&A.\n36\n•\nThe decrease in operating profit for our Asia-Pacific property segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in our segment gross margin, which was impacted by the VIL Shortfall, partially offset by a decrease in our segment SG&A.\n•\nThe increase in operating profit for our Data Centers segment was attributable to data centers acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021, including through the CoreSite Acquisition.\n•\nThe decrease in operating profit for our Services segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in our segment gross margin and an increase in our segment SG&A.\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion\nThe increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the acquisition, lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prior-year period, including due to the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition, which resulted in increases in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOther Operating Expenses\nThe increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of $482.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in integration and acquisition related costs, including pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements, of $122.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment charges included $97.0 million related to tower and network location intangible assets and $411.6 million related to tenant-related intangible assets in our Asia-Pacific property segment related to VIL in India. For more information on these impairments, see the information under the caption “India Impairments” included in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The year ended December 31, 2021 included acquisition and merger related costs associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses. We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies.\nThe increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to an increase in net interest expense of $234.4 million, primarily due to increases in our weighted average interest rate and our average debt outstanding, and a decrease in foreign currency gains of $108.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $37.8 million, primarily attributable to the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the securitizations assumed in connection with the InSite Acquisition (the “InSite Debt”) and repayment of our 4.70% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “4.70% Notes”) in the prior-year period.\nIncome Tax Provision\nAs a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 differs from the federal statutory rate.\n37\nThe decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to a reduction in taxable income due to impairment charges in India and the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. The decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 included the reversal of valuation allowances of $76.5 million in certain jurisdictions, as compared to a reversal of $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These valuation allowance reversals were recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision as the net related deferred tax assets were deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.\nNet Income / Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income / Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders / Consolidated AFFO / AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders\n_______________\n(1)    Included in these amounts are impairment charges of $655.9 million and $173.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n38\n(2)    For the year ended December 31, 2022, includes $16.7 million of distributions related to the outstanding Stonepeak mandatorily convertible preferred equity and dividends of $5.5 million paid to PGGM.\n(3)    In 2015, we incurred charges in connection with certain tax elections wherein MIP Tower Holdings LLC, parent company to Global Tower Partners (“GTP”), would no longer operate as a separate REIT for federal and state income tax purposes. We finalized a settlement related to this tax election during the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that these related transactions are nonrecurring, and do not believe it is an indication of our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe it is more meaningful to present Consolidated AFFO excluding these amounts.\n(4)    Includes gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $449.4 million and $557.9 million, respectively.\n(5)    Primarily includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs.\n(6)    Includes adjustments for the impact on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as well as the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nThe decrease in net income was primarily due to (i) an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, (ii) an increase in other operating expense, including an increase in impairment charges of $482.2 million, (iii) an increase in interest expense and (iv) a decrease in gains on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by (a) an increase in our operating profit and (b) a decrease in the income tax provision. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $25.7 million, attributable to the repayment of the InSite Debt and the 4.70% Notes.\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to an increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, of $110.9 million.\nThe increases in Consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, excluding the impact of straight-line accounting, partially offset by (i) increases in cash paid for taxes and cash paid for interest, (ii) an increase in dividends to noncontrolling interests, including $16.7 million of distributions payable related to the outstanding Stonepeak mandatorily convertible preferred equity, and (iii) an increase in capital improvement capital expenditures. The growth in AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was also impacted by changes in noncontrolling interests held in Data Centers, Europe and Asia-Pacific since the beginning of the prior-year period.\n39\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor a discussion of our 2021 Liquidity and Capital Resources, including a discussion of cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part I, Item 7 of the 2021 Form 10-K.\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2022 financing transactions included:\n•\nRepayment of debt assumed in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, including senior unsecured notes previously entered into by CoreSite (the “CoreSite Debt”).\n•\nRedemption of our 2.250% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “2.250% Notes”) upon their maturity.\n•\nRegistered public offering in an aggregate amount of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturities in 2027 and 2032.\n•\nRegistered public offering of\n9,185,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of\n$2.3 billion.\n•\nThe Stonepeak Transaction (as defined and further discussed below) pursuant to which we received an aggregate amount of approximately $3.1 billion.\n•\nRepayment of all amounts outstanding under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan (as defined below).\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, we made additional net borrowings of $895.0 million under the 2021 Credit Facility (as defined below) and $655.0 million under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility (as defined below). The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.\nSummary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions):\nWe use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including maintenance and improvements, communications site construction, managed network installations and acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.\nIn July 2022, in connection with the funding of the CoreSite Acquisition, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in our U.S. data center business. The transaction was completed in August 2022 for total aggregate consideration of $2.5 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity.\nIn October 2022, we entered into an agreement with Stonepeak for Stonepeak to acquire additional common equity and mandatorily preferred equity interests in our U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $570.0 million. The transaction was completed in October 2022. We expect to pay distributions related to the outstanding common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we hold a common equity interest of approximately 72% in our U.S. data center business, with Stonepeak holding approximately 28% of the outstanding common equity and 100% of the outstanding mandatorily convertible\n40\npreferred equity. On a fully converted basis, which is expected to occur four years from the date of the initial closing in August 2022, and on the basis of the currently outstanding equity, we will hold a controlling ownership interest of approximately 64%, with Stonepeak holding approximately 36%. The mandatorily convertible preferred equity, which accrues dividends at 5.0%, will convert into common equity on a one for one basis, subject to adjustment that will be measured on the conversion date.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $38.9 billion, with a current portion of $4.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our equity and debt issuances and cash on hand, to fund our acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2023, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, we had $244.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our joint ventures, of which $223.7 million was held by our foreign joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by operating activities decreased $1,123.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, include:\n•\nA decrease in unearned revenue due to advance payments from a customer during the year ended December 31, 2021;\n•\nAn increase in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of an increase in prepaid and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable;\n•\nAn increase of approximately $297.4 million in cash paid for interest; and\n•\nAn increase of approximately $97.1 million in cash paid for taxes.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 are highlighted below:\n•\nWe spent approximately $549.0 million for acquisitions, including payments made for acquisitions completed in 2021.\n•\nWe spent $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions):\n_______________\n(1)\nIncludes the construction of 6,890 communications sites globally and approximately $330 million of spend related to data center assets.\n(2)\nIncludes $36.7 million of perpetual land easement payments reported in Deferred financing costs and other financing activities in the cash flows from  financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n(3)\nIncludes $6.7 million of finance lease payments reported in Repayments of notes payable, credit facilities, term loans, senior notes, secured debt and finance leases in the cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n(4)\nNet of purchase credits of $14.5 million on certain assets, which are reported in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while maintaining our commitment to our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site and data center facility construction, and through acquisitions. We also regularly review our portfolios as to capital\n41\nexpenditures required to upgrade our infrastructure to our structural standards or address capacity, structural or permitting issues.\nWe expect that our 2023 total capital expenditures will be as follows (in millions):\n_______________\n(1)    Includes the construction of approximately 3,450 to 4,550 communications sites globally and approximately $360 million of anticipated spend related to data center assets.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur significant financing activities were as follows (in millions):\n_______________\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the InSite Debt.\n(2)\nIncludes the CoreSite Debt, which, as of December 31, 2021, included $875.0 million aggregate principal amount and a fair value adjustment of $80.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the CoreSite Debt.\n(3)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, includes approximately $3.1 billion of contributions received from Stonepeak in connection with the Stonepeak Transaction. For the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $3.1 billion of contributions received from Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”) and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, “Allianz”), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, “ATC Europe”) (the “ATC Europe Transactions”).\n(4)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $214.9 million of cash consideration paid to PGGM in connection with the reorganization of our subsidiaries in Europe.\n(5)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, includes the redemption of our minority interest in ATC TIPL for total consideration of INR 12.9 billion (approximately $173.2 million at the date of redemption). During the year ended December 31, 2021 we also liquidated our interests in a company held in France for total consideration of 2.2 million EUR (approximately $2.5 million at the date of redemption).\n42\nSenior Notes\nRepayments of Senior Notes\nRepayment of 2.250% Senior Notes\n—On January 14, 2022, we repaid $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.250% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “2.250% Notes”) upon their maturity. The 2.250% Notes were repaid using borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility. Upon completion of the repayment, none of the 2.250% Notes remained outstanding.\nRepayment of 3.50% Senior Notes\n—On January 31, 2023, we repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “3.50% Notes”) upon their maturity. The 3.50% Notes were repaid using borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility. Upon completion of the repayment, none of the 3.50% Notes remained outstanding.\nOffering of Senior Notes\n3.650% Senior Notes and 4.050% Senior Notes Offering—\nOn April 1, 2022, we completed a registered public offering of $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.650% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the “3.650% Notes”) and $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.050% senior unsecured notes due 2032 (the “4.050% Notes” and, together with the 3.650% Notes, the “Notes”). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,282.6 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility and the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan.\nThe key terms of the Notes are as follows:\n_______________\n(1)\nAccrued and unpaid interest on U.S. Dollar (“USD”) denominated notes is payable in USD semi-annually in arrears and will be computed from the issue date on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.\n(2)\nWe may redeem the Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the Notes on or after the par call date, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium.\nIf we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the supplemental indenture for the Notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries.\nThe supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the supplemental indenture.\nRepayment of CoreSite Debt—\nOn January 7, 2022, we repaid the entire amount outstanding under the CoreSite Debt, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, January 7, 2022, for an aggregate redemption price of $962.9 million, including $80.1 million of prepayment consideration and $7.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest. The repayment of the CoreSite Debt was funded with borrowings under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and cash on hand.\nBank Facilities\n2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility—\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow up to $6.0 billion under our $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021 (the “2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility”), which includes a $3.5 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed an aggregate of $850.0 million and repaid an aggregate of $1.4 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed an aggregate of $3.3 billion and repaid an aggregate of $3.7 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2021 Credit Facility. We used the borrowings to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the 2.250% Notes, and for general corporate purposes.\nRepayments under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan\n—On April 6, 2022, we repaid $100.0 million of indebtedness under our $3.0 billion unsecured term loan entered into in December 2021 (the “2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan”) using proceeds from the issuance of the 3.650% Notes and the 4.050% Notes and cash on hand. On June 10, 2022, we repaid $2.3 billion of indebtedness under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan using proceeds from the June 2022 common stock offering (as further discussed in note 14) and cash on hand. On August 11, 2022, we repaid all remaining amounts outstanding under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan using proceeds from the initial closing of the Stonepeak Transaction.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the key terms under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, our $1.0 billion unsecured term loan, as amended and restated in December 2021 (the “2021 Term Loan”), our 825.0 million EUR unsecured term loan, as amended in December 2021 (the “2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan”) and our $1.5 billion unsecured term loan entered into in December 2021 (the “2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan”) were as follows:\n_______________\n(1)\nRepresents interest rate above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings, interest rate above Euro Interbank Offer Rate (“EURIBOR”) for EURIBOR based borrowings and interest rate above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings.\n(2)\nCurrently borrowed at LIBOR for USD denominated borrowings and at EURIBOR for EUR denominated borrowings.\n(3)\nSubject to two optional renewal periods.\n(4)\nCurrently borrowed at LIBOR.\n(5)\nCurrently borrowed at EURIBOR.\nWe must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility. The commitment fee for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080% to 0.300% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110%.\nThe 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate, LIBOR or EURIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities.\nThe loan agreements for each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.\nNigeria Letters of Credit\n—During the year ended December 31, 2022, we drew on letters of credit in Nigeria (the “Nigeria Letters of Credit”). The drawn amounts bear interest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate at the time of drawing plus a spread. Amounts are due 270 days from the date of drawing. As of December 31, 2022, we had $16.2 million outstanding under the drawn Nigeria Letters of Credit.\n44\nIndia Indebtedness\nIndia Working Capital Facilities—\nThe India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate or Market Benchmark (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2022, we have not borrowed under these facilities.\nAmounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 (in millions, except percentages):\n_______________\n(1)    7.9 billion INR ($95.6 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2022. We have 0.2 billion INR (approximately $2.6 million) of of bank guarantees outstanding included within the overall borrowing capacity.\nIndia Term Loan—\nOn February 16, 2023, we entered into a 12.0 billion INR (approximately $145.1 million at the date of signing) unsecured term loan with a maturity date that is one year from the date of the first draw thereunder (the “India Term Loan”). On February 17, 2023, we borrowed 10.0 billion INR (approximately $120.7 million at the date of borrowing) under the India Term Loan. The India Term Loan bears interest at the three month treasury bill rate as announced by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Limited at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 1.95%. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The India Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium.\nStock Repurchase Programs\n— We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 90,042 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $18.8 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback.\nUnder each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time.\nWe have repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases.\nSales of Equity Securities\n—We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received an aggregate of $32.4 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP.\n2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program\n—In August 2020, we established an “at the market” stock offering program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion (the “2020 ATM Program”). Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any issuances under the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program.\n45\nCommon Stock Offering\n—\nOn June 7, 2022, we completed a registered public offering of 9,185,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, (which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) at $256.00 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.3 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan.\nFuture\nFinancing Transactions\n—\nWe regularly consider various options to access the capital markets, subject to market conditions, to meet our funding needs. Such capital raising alternatives, in addition to those noted above including the 2020 ATM Program, may include additional senior note offerings and securitization transactions. No assurance can be given as to whether any such financing transactions will be completed or as to the timing or terms thereof.\nDistributions—\nAs a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $14.5 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in February 2023, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending before 2026.\nThe amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $5.69 per share, or $2.6 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.56 per share, or $726.3 million, paid on February 2, 2023 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 28, 2022.\nWe accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $17.0 million and $12.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $6.9 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units.\nFor more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2022, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\n—\nThe following table summarizes material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):\n______________\n(1)    Includes aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).\n(2)    Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).\nDistributions—\nWe expect that our 2023 total distributions declared to our common stockholders will be $3.0 billion. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.\nAsset Retirement Obligations—\nWe are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $4.2 billion.\nFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity\nOur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.\n46\nInternally Generated Funds\n—Because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2022 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications infrastructure.\nRestrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities\n—The loan agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.\n_______________\n(1)    Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.\n(2)    Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.\n(3)    Assumes no change to our debt levels.\n(4)    Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.\nUnder the terms of the agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition were designated as a Qualified Acquisitions, whereby our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was adjusted to not exceed 7.50 to 1.00 for four full fiscal quarters following consummation of such acquisitions, which lasted until the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio stepped back down to not exceed 6.00 to 1.00. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.\nFailure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.\nRestrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations—\nThe indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).\nUnder the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”), and the\n47\nSecured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) issued in the Trust Securitizations (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2022, $78.4 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash.\nCertain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.\n_______________\n(1)    Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2022 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable.\n(2)    Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower.\n(3)    An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters.\n(4)    No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.\n(5)    An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full.\nA failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes.\n48\nFurthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,516 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,102 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.\nAs discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.\nIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.\n•\nImpairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization\n: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.\nWe review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.\nWe review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.\nIf the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.\nIn October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, and again in July 2021 with respect to the total charges, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers and could affect their ability to perform their obligations under\n49\nagreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government of India approved a relief package that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis. In the third quarter of 2022, our largest customer in India, VIL, communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million.\nWe will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from customers in India could have further negative effects on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangible assets, resulting in additional impairments. The carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $379.5 million as of December 31, 2022, which represents 3% of our consolidated balance of $13.1 billion. Additionally, a significant reduction in customer-related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets in India were $905.8 million and $266.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022, which represent 10% and 8% of our consolidated balances of $8.8 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.\n•\nImpairment of Assets—Goodwill:\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach), exceeded the carrying value by approximately 24%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions, including uncertainty with respect to amounts owed from VIL (discussed above). For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) 5% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 229 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 200% reduction in terminal revenue growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased tenant attrition exceeding our forecast, additional VIL payment shortfalls, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.”\n•\nAcquisitions\n: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset\n50\nwith a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition.\n•\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and our data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation.\nOur revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $499.8 million, $465.6 million and $322.0 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.\nWe derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 46% of our revenues derived from three tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.\n•\nRent Expense and Lease Accounting:\nMany of the leases underlying our tower sites and data centers have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. Our calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured.\nWe recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts.\nThe calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.\n•\nIncome Taxes:\nAccounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is\n51\nrecognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income.\nWe periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.\nWe recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.\nAccounting Standards Update\nFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report."

For long-term debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates (in millions, except percentages). For more information, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\n_______________\n(a)    Fixed rate debt consisted of: Securities issued in the Trust Securitizations; Securities issued in the 2015-2 Securitization; our senior unsecured notes (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a detailed description of all such senior unsecured notes), excluding the 3.000% Notes (as defined below); and other debt including finance leases.\n(b)    Variable rate debt consisted of: the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, which matures on June 30, 2025; the 2021 Credit Facility, which matures on January 31, 2027; the 2021 Term Loan, which matures on January 31, 2027; the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, which matures on May 28, 2024; the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, which matures on December 28, 2023; the 3.000% Notes; and other debt including the Nigeria Letters of Credit.\n(c)    Based on rates effective as of December 31, 2022.\n(d)    As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate swap agreements in the United States were included in Accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet.\n(e)    Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of our 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “3.000% Notes”). These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023.\nChanges in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 consisted of $3.8 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.1 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility, $1.0\n52\nbillion under the 2021 Term Loan, $883.2 million under the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes and $16.2 million under the Nigeria Letters of Credit. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $42.4 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 43% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $40.5 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we have 7.3 billion EUR (approximately $7.8 billion) denominated debt outstanding. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our outstanding EUR debt would result in $0.9 billion of foreign currency losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022."

Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on management’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Item 9A under the caption “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n54\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Tower Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of American Tower Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 23, 2023"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition for Significant Contract Modifications - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s contracts with major tenants are often governed by a master lease agreement that contains terms and provisions governing the tenant’s right to use the Company’s telecommunications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and the tenant’s responsibility for reimbursement of various costs incurred by the Company in operating the telecommunications towers and supporting the tenant’s equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease components”). The master lease agreements contain both lease and non-lease components, may contain unusual or non-standard terms, and often pertain to many of the Company’s telecommunications sites. In the current year, the Company amended a master lease agreement with a major tenant.\nManagement of the Company exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the amended master lease agreement, including the following:\n•\nDetermination of the lease and non-lease components and whether they should be accounted for as a combined lease component or separately.\nF-2\n•\nDetermination of the stand-alone selling prices for each performance obligation in the master lease agreement if not accounted for with the lease component.\n•\nDetermination of the fixed and variable consideration in the master lease agreement, the impact of cancellation and renewal provisions, the estimated term of each of the individual contracts impacted by the master lease agreement, and the pattern of recognition for each lease component or performance obligation.\nWe identified the amended master lease agreement with a major tenant as a critical audit matter because the audit effort required to evaluate the Company’s judgments in determining the appropriate revenue recognition for the impact of a multi-faceted, complex master lease agreement entered into with the major tenant was extensive.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company’s amended master lease agreement with the major customer included the following:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the Company’s process for evaluating the proper accounting for the master lease agreement.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s significant accounting policies related to the master lease agreement for reasonableness and compliance with the applicable accounting standards.\n•\nWe evaluated the master lease agreement and performed the following procedures:\n◦\nObtained and evaluated the documents that were part of the overall master lease agreement.\n◦\nTested the Company’s identification of the significant terms for completeness and accuracy, including the identification of the lease and non-lease components, cancellation and renewal provisions, estimated term and fixed and variable consideration.\n◦\nTested the completeness and accuracy of leases subject to the master lease agreement.\n◦\nAssessed the terms and provisions in the master lease agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.\n•\nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company’s determination of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.\nRecoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets – India Reporting Unit - Refer to Notes 1, 3, 5, 16, and 22 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, the Company reviews other long-lived assets to be held and used and which are subject to depreciation or amortization, such as property and equipment, tenant-related intangible assets, network location intangible assets, and right-of-use assets on operating leases for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company's evaluation of recovery of goodwill involves the comparison of the carrying amount of a reporting unit inclusive of allocated goodwill to the fair value of the applicable reporting unit.  The Company’s evaluation of the recovery of long-lived assets, involves a comparison of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.\nIf these assets are determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined using forecasted cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital. As of December 31, 2022, the India reporting unit had goodwill of approximately $881.6 million. As the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeded its’ carrying amount as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that its related goodwill was not impaired. Other long-lived assets to be held and used in India at December 31, 2022 consisted of property and equipment, tenant-related intangible assets, network location intangible assets, and right of use assets of approximately $924.4 million, $379.5 million, $266.7 million and $668.9 million, respectively, after impairments were recorded during the year then ended of $58.6 million, $411.6 million,  $38.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nF-3\nWe identified the evaluation of the recovery of goodwill and long-lived assets held in the Company’s India reporting unit, along with any related impairments, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows and related estimated fair values used in the impairment analyses. There was a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating management's assumptions and estimates related to future tenant retention rates (specifically, a high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate future revenues related to variability in receipts from a significant tenant in India), revenue growth rates, margin projections, the timing of future cash flows, the discount rate used and the determination of market multiples for the India reporting unit and related long-lived assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the assumptions and estimates of future tenant retention rates, revenue growth rates, and margin projections used to estimate the timing and extent of future cash flows, and the discount rate and the determination of market multiples used by management to estimate fair value, included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the India reporting unit.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management’s long-lived asset impairment evaluation.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to forecast future tenant retention rates, revenue growth rates, margin projections and timing of future cash flows by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s use of tenant retention rates, growth rates, margin projections and timing of future cash flows by comparing the forecasts to:\n◦\nHistorical results.\n◦\nInternal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\n◦\nForecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 23, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\nF-4\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except share count and per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(in millions, share counts in thousands)\n_______________\n(1)    For the year ended December 31, 2021, Additional-Paid in Capital includes $\n17.1\nmillion related to the CoreSite Replacement Awards (as described in note 6).\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-8\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOW\n(in millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-9\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n1.\nBUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness\n—American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “ATC” or the “Company”) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company’s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting (“AZP”), structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support the Company’s site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company’s customers include its tenants, licensees and other payers.\nThe Company’s portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (“DAS”) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators and holds a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that the Company leases primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\nAmerican Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC’s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.\nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers and in its data centers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). In addition, the Company’s international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\nThe use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business, its Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of its operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\n—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company’s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company holds (i) a\n52\n% controlling interest in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, “ATC Europe”) (Allianz and CDPQ (each as defined in note 15) hold the noncontrolling interests), (ii) a\n51\n% controlling interest in a joint venture whose holdings consist of the Company’s operations in Bangladesh (Confidence Tower Holdings Ltd. (“Confidence Group”) holds the noncontrolling interest) and (iii) a common equity interest of approximately\n72\n% in the Company’s U.S. data center business (Stonepeak (as defined and further discussed in note 15) holds approximately\n28\n% of the outstanding common equity and\n100\n% of the outstanding mandatorily convertible preferred equity). As of December 31, 2022, ATC Europe holds an\n87\n% and an\n83\n% controlling interest in subsidiaries that consist of the Company’s operations in Germany and Spain, respectively (PGGM holds the noncontrolling interests). See note 15 for a discussion of changes to the Company’s noncontrolling interests during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nF-10\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nReportable Segments\n—The Company reports its results in\nseven\nsegments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company’s data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services, which are discussed further in note 20.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of long-lived assets (including goodwill), revenue recognition, rent expense and lease accounting, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets. The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure.\nAccounts Receivable and Deferred Rent Asset\n—The Company derives the largest portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of customers in the telecommunications industry, and\n46\n% of its current-year revenues are derived from\nthree\ncustomers.\nThe Company’s deferred rent asset is associated with non-cancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its borrowers and customers. In recognizing customer revenue, the Company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, revenue recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customer’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. These allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns, days past due and collection history, and incorporate changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in historical trends, such as customers in bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization. Receivables are written-off against the allowances or reserves when they are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination includes analysis and consideration of the particular conditions of the account.\nChanges in the allowances were as follows:\nFunctional Currency\n—The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries is normally the respective local currency, except for Costa Rica and Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. All foreign currency assets and liabilities held by the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reflected in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”) in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nGains and losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations. However, the effect from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany debt for which repayment is not\nF-11\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nanticipated in the foreseeable future is reflected in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and included as a component of Comprehensive income.\nThe Company recorded the following net foreign currency (gains) losses:\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n—Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its deposits at high-quality financial institutions and monitors the credit ratings of those institutions.\nRestricted Cash—\nRestricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral to secure obligations and all cash whose use is otherwise limited by contractual provisions.\nThe reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the applicable balance sheet that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows is as follows:\nRestricted cash as of December 31, 2021 included advance payments from a customer.\nProperty and Equipment\n—Property and equipment is recorded at cost or, in the case of acquired properties, at estimated fair value on the date acquired. Cost for self-constructed sites includes direct materials and labor and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the site, such as transportation costs, employee benefits and payroll taxes. The Company begins the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period, which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site, and continues to capitalize costs until the site is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a customer. Labor and related costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $\n65.2\nmillion, $\n59.4\nmillion and $\n51.1\nmillion, respectively.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Augmentation and improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized.\nDepreciation expense is recorded using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives. Towers and assets on leased land are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset taking into consideration the term of the corresponding ground lease and residual value.\nTowers or assets acquired through finance leases are recorded net at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Property and equipment and assets held under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding\ntwenty years\n.\nThe Company reviews its asset portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual site basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n—The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nF-12\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nGoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company employs a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nno\npotential goodwill impairment was identified, as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.\nIntangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from\ntwo\nto\ntwenty years\nand are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nThe Company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company monitors its tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, the customer’s ability to meet its contractual obligations, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. The Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the Company determines that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company measures any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair value, as compared to the asset’s carrying amount. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n—Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCL, as well as a component of comprehensive income, and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs.\nThe primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk, exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk. From time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks. Under these agreements, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract. The Company’s exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform. The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes.\nFair Value Measurements\n—The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n—When required, the Company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its assets and remediate the leased space upon which certain of its assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. Fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows associated with remediation costs. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows, with an offsetting adjustment made to the related long-lived tangible asset. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of asset removals; cost of asset removals;\nF-13\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\ntiming and number of site lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates that approximate the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.\nIncome Taxes\n—As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets, and provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.\nThe Company estimates the liabilities from uncertain tax positions, which are recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company reports penalties and tax-related interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds as a component of Interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n—Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges, foreign currency translation adjustments, reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges and other items.\nThe AOCL balance included accumulated foreign currency translation losses of $\n5.7\nbillion, $\n4.7\nbillion and $\n3.8\nbillion as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDistributions\n—As a REIT, the Company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, the Company has distributed, and expects to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of its REIT taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses (“NOLs”).\nThe amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond the Company’s control, including the Company’s financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that the Company otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in the Company’s existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, the Company’s ability to utilize NOLs to offset the Company’s distribution requirements, limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its TRSs and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nAcquisitions\n—For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, the Company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All other acquisitions are accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price is allocated to the net assets acquired with no recognition of goodwill. The purchase price is not subsequently adjusted.\nThe fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, the Company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life and productive capacity of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition, and apply the applicable discount rate.\nF-14\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nRevenue\n—The Company’s revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and the space in its data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and data center facilities and supporting its customers’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of the Company’s revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with customers that are generally not accounted for as leases.\nThe Company’s revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index (“CPI”), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company’s tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $\n499.8\nmillion, $\n465.6\nmillion and $\n322.0\nmillion, respectively.\nNon-lease property revenue—\nNon-lease property revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements generally require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use available capacity on the applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Non-lease property revenue also includes revenue generated from interconnection offerings in the Company’s data center facilities. Interconnection offerings are generally contracted on a month-to-month basis and are cancellable by the Company or the data center customer at any time. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis.\nServices revenue—\nThe Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP, structural analysis and construction management. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural analysis services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed.\nSome of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to customers.\nSince most of the Company’s contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value added tax and similar taxes from non-lease revenue.\nRevenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company’s business segments, which are discussed further in note 20. A summary of revenue disaggregated by source and geography is as follows:\nF-15\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nInformation about non-lease receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers is as follows:\n_______________\n(1)    Includes capital contributions related to DAS networks.\nThe Company records unearned revenue when payments are received from customers in advance of the completion of the Company’s performance obligations. Long-term unearned revenue is included in Other non-current liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $\n135.3\nmillion of revenue that was previously included in the contract liabilities balances, primarily arising from balances as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company records unbilled receivables, which are included in Prepaids and other current assets, when it has completed a performance obligation prior to its ability to bill under the customer arrangement. Other contract assets are included in Notes receivable and other non-current assets. The Company recorded an immaterial change in unbilled receivables attributable to non-lease property revenue recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The change in contract assets attributable to revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $(\n0.3\n) million and $\n2.2\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for agreements (i) with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.\nLease Accounting and Rent Expense\n—The Company accounts for leases using a right-of-use model, which recognizes that, at the date of commencement, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lessee recognizes a corresponding right-of-use asset related to this right.\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the Company’s assets may not be recoverable. The Company reviews its right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, as part of its asset portfolio. Impairments primarily result from a site not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. The Company records impairment charges, which are discussed in note 16, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the Company identifies such impairment.\nF-16\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nThe calculation of the lease liability requires the Company to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, the Company considers the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to the Company and the lessor. The Company determines the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.\nMany of the leases underlying the Company’s sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the Company over time. In addition, certain of the Company’s tenant leases require the Company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. The Company’s calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the Company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured.\nThe straight-line component of ground rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n39.6\nmillion, $\n52.7\nmillion and $\n51.6\nmillion, respectively.\nSelling, General, Administrative and Development Expense\n—Selling, general and administrative expense consists of overhead expenses related to the Company’s property and services operations and corporate overhead costs not specifically allocable to any of the Company’s individual business operations. Development expense consists of costs related to the Company’s acquisition efforts, costs associated with new business initiatives and project cancellation costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\n—Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is generally recognized as an expense over the service period, which typically represents the vesting period. The Company provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense for stock options and time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) over the shorter of (i) the\nfour-year\nvesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such benefits due to death, disability or qualified retirement, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized includes the impact of forfeitures as they occur.\nThe Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) to its executive officers. Threshold, target and maximum parameters are established for a\nthree-year\nperformance period at the time of grant. The metrics are used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the awards vest, which may range from\nzero\nto\n200\n% of the target amounts. The Company recognizes compensation expense for PSUs over the\nthree-year\nvesting period, subject to adjustment based on the date the employee becomes eligible for retirement benefits as well as performance relative to grant parameters.\nThe fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of RSUs and PSUs is based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes all stock-based compensation expense in Selling, general, administrative and development expense.\nIn connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, the Company withholds from issuance a number of shares of common stock to satisfy certain employee tax withholding obligations arising from such vesting. The shares withheld are considered constructively retired. The Company recognizes the fair value of the shares withheld in Additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has withheld from issuance an aggregate of\n2.8\nmillion shares, including\n0.2\nmillion shares related to the vesting of restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLitigation Costs\n—The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business. The Company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss. The Company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss, or possible range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those liabilities may be required. The Company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses, which are reflected in Selling, general, administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nEarnings Per Common Share\n—\nBasic and Diluted\n—Basic net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share represents net income attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and any dilutive common share equivalents, including (A) shares issuable upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options and\nF-17\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n(B) shares expected to be earned upon the achievement of the parameters established for PSUs, each to the extent not anti-dilutive. The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of its outstanding RSUs, PSUs and stock options.\nRetirement Plan\n—The Company has a 401(k) plan covering nearly all eligible employees who meet certain age and employment requirements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company matched\n100\n% of the first\n5\n% of a participant's contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company contributed $\n16.9\nmillion, $\n14.9\nmillion and $\n13.2\nmillion to the plan, respectively.\n2.\nPREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nPrepaid and other current assets consisted of the following:\n3.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment (including assets held under finance leases) consisted of the following:\n_______________\n(1)    Assets on leased land are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset taking into consideration the corresponding ground lease term and residual value.\n(2)    Includes fiber, DAS and data center related assets.\n(3)    Estimated useful lives apply to improvements only.\nTotal depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n1,552.6\nmillion, $\n1,036.2\nmillion and $\n924.3\nmillion, respectively. Depreciation expense includes amounts related to finance lease assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 of $\n145.4\nmillion, $\n146.8\nmillion and $\n153.0\nmillion, respectively.\nF-18\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nInformation about finance lease-related balances is as follows:\n4.\nLEASES\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the agreement. The Company considers an arrangement to be a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of the communications infrastructure or ground space underneath communications infrastructure for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company is both a lessor and a lessee.\nLessor\n—The Company is a lessor in most of its revenue arrangements, as property revenue is derived from tenant leases of specifically-identified, physically distinct space on or in the Company’s communications real estate assets. The Company’s lease arrangements with its tenants for its communications sites vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant and generally have initial non-cancellable terms of\nfive\nto\nten years\nwith multiple renewal terms. The leases also contain provisions that periodically increase the rent due, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage or an inflationary index, or a combination of both. The Company structures its leases to include financial penalties if a tenant terminates the lease, which serve to disincentivize tenants from terminating the lease prior to the expiration of the lease term.\nThe Company’s leasing arrangements outside of the United States may require that the Company provide power to the communications site through an electrical grid connection, diesel fuel generators or other sources and permit the Company to pass through the costs of, or otherwise charge for, these services. Many arrangements require that the communications site has power for a specified percentage of time. In most cases, if delivery of power falls below the specified service level, a corresponding reduction in revenue is recorded. The Company has determined that this performance obligation is satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. In addition, the Company provides power to its data center customers, which is passed through, or otherwise charged, to customers pursuant to the terms of the customer power arrangement. Customer power arrangements are coterminous with such customer’s underlying lease and have the same pattern of transfer over the lease term. This performance obligation is generally satisfied over time for the duration of the lease. Fixed power revenue is recognized each month over the term of the lease. For variable power arrangements, the Company recognizes revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved.\nThe Company typically has more than\none\ntenant on a site and, by performing ordinary course repair and maintenance work, can often lease a site, either through renewing existing agreements or leasing to new tenants, for periods beyond the existing tenant lease term. Accordingly, the Company has minimal risk with respect to the residual value of its leased assets. Communications infrastructure assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which generally do not exceed\ntwenty years\n.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessor. To the extent there are any intercompany leases, these are eliminated in consolidation. The Company generally does not enter into sales-type leases or direct financing leases. The Company’s leases generally do not include any incentives for the lessee, however, if incentives are present, they are evaluated to determine proper treatment and, to the extent present, are recorded in Other current assets and\nF-19\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nOther non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the corresponding lease term as a component of revenue. In addition, the Company’s leases do not include any lessee purchase options.\nHistorically, the Company has been able to successfully renew its applicable leases as needed to ensure continuation of its revenue. Accordingly, the Company assumes that it will have access to the communications infrastructure or ground space underlying its sites when calculating future minimum rental receipts through the end of the respective terms.\nFuture minimum rental receipts expected under non-cancellable operating lease agreements as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:\n_______________\n(1)    Balances are translated at the applicable period-end exchange rate, which may impact comparability between periods.\n(2)    Balances represent contractual amounts owned with no adjustments made for expected collectibility.\nLessee\n—The Company enters into arrangements as a lessee primarily for ground space underneath its communications sites. These arrangements are typically long-term lease agreements with initial non-cancellable terms of approximately\nfive\nto\nten years\nwith\none\nor more automatic or exercisable renewal periods and specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal options. The Company typically exercises its ground lease renewal options in order to provide ongoing tenant space on or in its communications sites through the end of the tenant lease term. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to CPI or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lease term of the applicable lease as a component of rent expense. Additionally, the escalations tied to CPI or another inflation-based index are considered variable lease payments. In certain circumstances, the Company enters into revenue sharing arrangements with the ground space owner, which results in variability in lease payments. In most markets outside of the United States, in the event there are no tenants on the communications site, the Company generally has unilateral termination rights and in certain situations, the lease is structured to allow for termination by the Company with minimal or no penalties. Ground lease arrangements usually include annual escalations and do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictions on dividends, other financial obligations or other similar terms. The Company has entered into certain transactions whereby at the end of a lease, sublease or similar arrangement, the Company has the option to purchase the corresponding communications sites. These transactions are further described in note 18.\nThe Company’s lease liability is the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments to be made over the remaining lease term, including renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company also considers termination options and factors those into the determination of lease payments when appropriate. To determine the lease term, the Company considers all renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised, taking into consideration all economic factors, including the communications site’s estimated economic life (generally\ntwenty years\n) and the respective lease terms of the Company’s tenants under the existing lease arrangements on such site.\nThe Company assesses its right-of-use asset and other lease-related assets for impairment, as described in note 1. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $\n8.1\nmillion, $\n3.3\nmillion and $\n76.1\nmillion, respectively, of impairment expense related to these assets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have any material related party leases as a lessee. The Company does not have any sale-leaseback arrangements as lessee and typically does not enter into leveraged leases.\nThe Company leases certain land, buildings, equipment and office space under operating leases and land and improvements, towers, equipment and vehicles under finance leases. As of December 31, 2022, operating lease assets were included in Right-of-use asset and\nfinance lease assets\nwere included in Property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheet.\nF-20\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nInformation about other lease-related balances is as follows:\nAs most of the Company’s leases do not specifically state an implicit rate, the Company uses a market-specific incremental borrowing rate consistent with the lease term as of the lease commencement date or upon a remeasurement event when calculating the present value of the remaining lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the cost to borrow on a securitized basis in each market. The remaining lease term does not reflect all renewal options available to the Company, only those renewal options that the Company has assessed as reasonably certain of being exercised taking into consideration the economic and other factors noted above.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms and incremental borrowing rates are as follows:\nThe following table sets forth the components of lease cost for the years ended December 31,:\n_______________\n(1)    Includes property tax paid on behalf of the landlord.\nThe interest expense on finance lease liabilities was $\n1.1\nmillion, $\n1.2\nmillion and $\n1.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Assets held under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment and are depreciated over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the remaining useful life.\nF-21\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nSupplemental cash flow information is as follows for the years ended December 31,:\n_______________\n(1)    Amount includes new operating leases and leases acquired in connection with acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, includes $\n1.4\nbillion related to the Telxius Acquisition (as defined in note 6).\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company does not have material operating or financing leases that have not yet commenced.\nMaturities of operating and finance lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 were as follows:\n_______________\n(1)    Balances are translated at the applicable period-end exchange rate, which may impact comparability between periods.\nF-22\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n5.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe changes in the carrying value of goodwill for each of the Company’s business segments were as follows:\n_______________\n(1)    U.S. & Canada consists of measurement period adjustments related to the acquisition of InSite Wireless Group, LLC (the “InSite Acquisition”). Asia-Pacific consists of $\n9.2\nmillion of additions related to the acquisition of Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited and measurement period adjustments related to the InSite Acquisition. Europe and Latin America consist of additions and measurement period adjustments related to the Telxius Acquisition (as defined in note 6). Data Centers consists of $\n3.0\nbillion of additions related to data center acquisitions, primarily from the CoreSite Acquisition (as defined in note 6).\n(2)    Europe and Latin America consist of measurement period adjustments related to the Telxius Acquisition. Data Centers consists of measurement period adjustments related to the CoreSite Acquisition.\n(3)    Other represents the goodwill associated with certain operations acquired in connection with the InSite Acquisition. These business operations were sold during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company’s other intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following:\n_______________\n(1)    Acquired network location intangibles are amortized over the shorter of the term of the corresponding ground lease, taking into consideration lease renewal options and residual value, generally up to\n20\nyears, as the Company considers these intangibles to be directly related to the tower assets.\nThe acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired tower communications infrastructure. The acquired tenant-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of tenant contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals. Other intangibles represent the value of acquired licenses, trade name and in place leases. In place lease value represents the fair value of costs avoided in securing data center customers, including vacancy periods, legal costs and commissions. In place lease value also includes assumptions on similar costs avoided upon the renewal or extension of existing leases on a basis consistent with occupancy assumptions used in the fair value of other assets.\nThe Company amortizes its acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company’s intangible assets wa\ns\n15\nyears\n. Amortization of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n1.7\nbillion, $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n0.9\nbillion, respectively.\nF-23\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nBased on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the next five years:\n6.\nACQUISITIONS\nThe Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date).\nThe fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date.\nImpact of current year acquisitions\n—The Company typically acquires communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites and related assets into its existing portfolio of communications sites and related assets. In the United States, acquisitions may also include data center facilities and related assets. The financial results of the Company’s acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Communications sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees.\nFor those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition and merger related costs may include finder’s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to completing the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations, as well as integration costs for all acquisitions, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded acquisition and merger related expenses for business combinations and non-capitalized asset acquisition costs and integration costs as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded net benefits of $\n15.1\nmillion, $\n17.6\nmillion and $\n4.4\nmillion related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements, respectively. The year ended December 31, 2022 included acquisition and merger related costs associated with the Stonepeak Transaction (as defined in note 15). The year ended\nF-24\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nDecember 31, 2021 included acquisition and merger related costs associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition (each as defined below).\n2022 Transactions\nThe estimated aggregate impact of the acquisitions completed in 2022 on the Company’s revenues and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $\n6.8\nmillion and $\n4.8\nmillion, respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new customers to such communications infrastructure assets subsequent to the transaction date. Acquisitions completed in 2022 were included in all of the Company’s property segments.\nSpain Fiber Acquisition\n—During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired fiber connected to the Company’s communications sites in Spain from Telefónica de España S.A.U. for an aggregate total purchase price of\n120.1\nmillion Euro (“EUR”) (approximately $\n128.8\nmillion at the dates of closing), including value added tax. This acquisition is being accounted for as an asset acquisition and is included in the table below in “Other.”\nNew Zealand Acquisition\n—During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company, through its recently formed New Zealand subsidiary, acquired land under carrier or other third-party communications sites in New Zealand from Clearspan Pty Ltd for total consideration of\n50.1\nmillion New Zealand Dollars (approximately $\n28.7\nmillion at the date of closing) (the “New Zealand Acquisition”). The New Zealand Acquisition is being accounted for as an asset acquisition and is included in the table below in “Other.”\nOther Acquisitions—\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired a total of\n507\ncommunications sites, as well as other communications infrastructure assets, in the United States, Canada, France, Mexico, Nigeria and Poland, including\n441\ncommunications sites in connection with the Company’s agreements with Orange S.A. (“Orange”) as further described below, for an aggregate purchase price of $\n298.9\nmillion. Of the aggregate purchase price, $\n61.2\nmillion is reflected as a payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. These acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and are included in the table below in “Other.”\nThe following table summarizes the allocations of the purchase prices for the fiscal year 2022 acquisitions based upon their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition:\n______________\n(1)    Tenant-related intangible assets and network location intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nOther Signed Acquisitions\nOrange Acquisition—\nOn November 28, 2019, the Company entered into definitive agreements with Orange for the acquisition of up to approximately\n2,000\ncommunications sites in France over a period of up to\nfive years\nfor total consideration in the range of approximately\n500.0\nmillion EUR to\n600.0\nmillion EUR (approximately $\n550.5\nmillion to $\n660.5\nmillion at the date of signing) to be paid over the\nfive-year\nterm. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company acquired\n1,197\nof these communications sites. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company acquired an additional\n441\nof these communications sites. The remaining communications sites are expected to continue to close in tranches, subject to customary closing conditions.\nF-25\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n2021 Transactions\nTelxius Acquisition\n—On January 13, 2021, the Company entered into two agreements with Telxius Telecom, S.A. (“Telxius”), a subsidiary of Telefónica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately\n31,000\ncommunications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately\n7.7\nbillion EUR (approximately $\n9.4\nbillion at the date of signing) (the “Telxius Acquisition”), subject to certain adjustments. In June 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of nearly\n20,000\ncommunications sites in Germany and Spain, for total consideration of approximately\n6.3\nbillion EUR (approximately $\n7.7\nbillion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments and over\n7,000\ncommunications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina, for total consideration of approximately\n0.9\nbillion EUR (approximately $\n1.1\nbillion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the approximately\n4,000\nremaining communications sites in Germany pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition for\n0.6\nbillion EUR (approximately $\n0.7\nbillion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\nOf the aggregate purchase price,\n254.6\nmillion EUR (approximately $\n272.5\nmillion), including post-closing adjustments, of deferred payments are due in September 2025 and are reflected in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. The acquired operations in Germany and Spain are included in the Europe property segment and the acquired operations in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina are included in the Latin America property segment. The Telxius Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the allocation of the purchase price was finalized during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary and final allocations of the purchase price paid and the amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Telxius Acquisition based upon its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Balances are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n_______________\n(1)\nBalances reflect the preliminary allocation as of September 30, 2021 following the August 2, 2021 closing of the second tranche of the Telxius Acquisition in Germany.\n(2)\nTenant-related intangible assets and network location intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nCoreSite Acquisition\n—On November 14, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with CoreSite Realty Corporation (“CoreSite”) to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of CoreSite common stock at $\n170.00\nper share. CoreSite’s portfolio consisted of\n24\ndata center facilities and related assets in\neight\nUnited States markets. On December 28, 2021, the Company completed the CoreSite Acquisition for total consideration of approximately $\n10.4\nbillion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite’s existing debt (the “CoreSite Acquisition”). The acquired assets and operations are included in the Data Centers segment. The CoreSite Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The allocation of the purchase price was finalized during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nF-26\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary and final allocations of the purchase price paid and the amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the CoreSite Acquisition based upon its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Balances are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n_______________\n(1)\nTenant-related intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over a\n10\nyear period. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n(2)\nThe CoreSite Acquisition debt assumed included $\n875.0\nmillion of CoreSite’s indebtedness and a fair value adjustment of $\n80.1\nmillion.

The CoreSite Replacement Awards continue to vest in accordance with the terms of CoreSite’s equity plan. The fair value of the CoreSite Replacement Awards for services rendered through December 28, 2021, the CoreSite Acquisition date, was recognized as a component of the purchase price, with the remaining fair value of the CoreSite Replacement Awards related to the post-combination services recorded as stock-based compensation over the remaining vesting period.\nPro Forma Consolidated Results (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents the unaudited pro forma financial results as if the 2022 acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2021 and the 2021 acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma results, to the extent available, are based on historical information, and accordingly may not fully reflect the current operations of the acquired business. In addition, the pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost synergies, costs or other integration impacts. Accordingly, such pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the transactions been completed on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of the Company.\nF-27\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n7.\nACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccrued expenses consisted of the following:\nF-28\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n8.\nLONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS\nOutstanding amounts under the Company’s long-term obligations, reflecting discounts, premiums, debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments due to interest rate swaps consisted of the following:\nF-29\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n_______________\n(1)\nReflects interest rate or maturity date as of December 31, 2022; interest rate does not reflect the impact of the interest rate swap agreements.\n(2)\nAccrues interest at a variable rate.\n(3)\nReflects borrowings denominated in EUR and, for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility (as defined below), reflects borrowings denominated in both EUR and U.S. Dollars (“USD”).\n(4)\nRepaid in full during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nusing proceeds from (i) the issuance of the\n3.650\n% Notes and the\n4.050\n% Notes (each as defined below), (ii) the June 2022 common stock offering (as further discussed in note 14), (iii) the Stonepeak Transaction (as defined and further discussed in note 15) and (iv) cash on hand.\n(5)\nRepaid in full on January 14, 2022 using borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility (as defined below).\n(6)\nRepaid in full on January 31, 2023 using\nborrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility\n.\n(7)\nNotes are denominated in EUR.\n(8)\nMaturity date reflects the anticipated repayment date; final legal maturity is March 15, 2048.\n(9)\nMaturity date reflects the anticipated repayment date; final legal maturity is June 15, 2050.\n(10)\nDebt entered into by CoreSite assumed in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition (the “CoreSite Debt”).

To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act” and, such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of the Company’s affiliates purchased, $\n26.4\nmillion aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities.\nThe Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities” and, together with the 2018 Securities the “Trust Securities”) issued in a securitization transaction in March 2013 (the “2013 Securitization” and, together with the 2018 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”) remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization.\nThe assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in\n5,102\nbroadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”).\nThe component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement includes terms and conditions, including with respect to secured assets, substantially consistent with the First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of March 15, 2013. The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Loan Agreement and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of\n3.652\n% and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of\n4.459\n%. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048. Subject to certain limited exceptions described below, no payments of principal will be required to be made on the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities prior to the monthly payment date in March 2028, which is the anticipated repayment date for such components.\nThe Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations.\nUnder the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement or 2015 Indenture, as applicable, including interest payments, subject to the conditions described below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, the Company.\nIn order to distribute any excess cash flow to the Company, the AMT Asset Subs and GTP Acquisition Partners must each maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (the “DSCR”), which is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding\n12\nmonths on the principal amount of the Loan or the 2015 Notes, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. If the DSCR were equal to or below\n1.30\nx (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) for any quarter, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable. The funds in the Cash Trap Reserve Account will not be released to the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, unless the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for\ntwo\nconsecutive calendar quarters.\nAdditionally, an “amortization period” commences if, as of the end of any calendar quarter, the DSCR is equal to or below\n1.15\nx (the “Minimum DSCR”) and will continue to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. With respect to the Trust Securities, an “amortization period” also commences if, on the anticipated\nF-34\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nrepayment date the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Trust Securities has not been repaid in full, provided that such amortization period shall apply with respect to such component that has not been repaid in full. If the Series 2015-2 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Series 2015-2 Notes, and such notes will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, as applicable, on each monthly payment date.\nThe Loan and the Series 2015-2 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within\n18\nmonths of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2013-2A Securities or the Series 2015-2 Notes, or\n36\nmonths of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due.\nThe Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities, as applicable, are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture, as applicable). The organizational documents of the AMT Asset Subs and the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture also contain certain covenants that require the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, to provide the respective trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify such trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Trust Sites or the 2015 Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites, as applicable, and allow the applicable trustee reasonable access to the sites, including the right to conduct site investigations.\nA failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement or the 2015 Indenture could prevent the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, as applicable, from distributing excess cash flow to the Company. Furthermore, if the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners were to default on the Loan or the Series 2015-2 Notes, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the Trust Sites or the 2015 Secured Sites, respectively, in which case the Company could lose the revenue and cash flows associated with those assets. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than\n50\n% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare such notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes.\nFurther, under the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, the AMT Asset Subs or GTP Acquisition Partners, respectively, are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and, under the 2015 Indenture and in certain circumstances under the Loan Agreement, to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Trust Sites. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement and the 2015 Indenture, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the applicable trustee and then released. The $\n68.7\nmillion held in the reserve accounts with respect to the Trust Securitizations and the $\n9.7\nmillion held in the reserve accounts with respect to the 2015 Securitization as of December 31, 2022 are classified as Restricted cash on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIndia Indebtedness\n—\nThe India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal.

The Company acquired this debt in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition. The CoreSite Debt was recorded at fair value upon the closing of the CoreSite Acquisition.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the value of the derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period, along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company records the change in fair value for the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in AOCL in the consolidated balance sheets and reclassifies a portion of the value from AOCL into Interest expense on a quarterly basis as the cash flows from the hedged item affects earnings.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded net fair value adjustments of $(\n0.1\n) million related to interest rate swaps and the change in fair value of debt due to interest rate swaps in Other expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAssets Held and Used\n—The Company’s long-lived assets are recorded at amortized cost and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $\n46.1\nbillion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $\n655.9\nmillion. During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain long-lived assets held and used with a carrying value of $\n49.0\nbillion were written down to their net realizable value as a result of an asset impairment charge of $\n173.7\nmillion. The asset impairment charges are recorded in Other operating expenses in the accompanying\nconsolidated statements of operations\n. These adjustments were determined by comparing the estimated fair value utilizing projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the long-lived assets to the asset’s carrying value.\nThere were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n—The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021 include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company’s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $\n38.7\nbillion and $\n35.1\nbillion, respectively, of which $\n24.5\nbillion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $\n10.6\nbillion was measured using\nF-38\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nLevel 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value and fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, were $\n43.3\nbillion and $\n44.1\nbillion, respectively, of which $\n28.5\nbillion was measured using Level 1 inputs and $\n15.6\nbillion was measured using Level 2 inputs.\n12.\nINCOME TAXES\nBeginning in the taxable year ended December 31, 2012, the Company has filed, and intends to continue to file, U.S. federal income tax returns as a REIT, and its domestic TRSs filed, and intend to continue to file, separate tax returns as required. The Company also files tax returns in various states and countries. The Company’s state tax returns reflect different combinations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are dependent on the connection each subsidiary has with a particular state and form of organization.\nThe following information pertains to the Company’s income taxes on a consolidated basis.\nThe income tax provision from continuing operations consisted of the following:\nThe effective tax rate (“ETR”) on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, as well as adjustments for state and foreign items. As a REIT, the Company may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the change in the income tax provision was primarily attributable to a reduction in taxable income due to impairment charges in India and the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. The decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 included the reversal of valuation allowances of $\n76.5\nmillion in certain jurisdictions, as compared to a reversal of $\n26.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. These valuation allowance reversals were recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision as the net related deferred tax assets were deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.\nReconciliation between the U.S. statutory rate and the effective rate from continuing operations is as follows:\n_______________\n(1)    As a result of the ability to utilize the dividends paid deduction to offset the Company’s REIT income and gains.\nF-39\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nThe domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:\nThe components of the net deferred tax asset and liability and related valuation allowance were as follows:\nThe Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances may be reversed if, based on changes in facts and circumstances, the net deferred tax assets have been determined to be realizable.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $\n335.7\nmillion and $\n329.3\nmillion, respectively, which primarily relates to foreign items. The increase in the valuation allowance for the year ending December 31, 2022 is due to uncertainty as to the timing of, and the Company’s ability to recover, net deferred tax assets in certain foreign operations in the foreseeable future, offset by reversals and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for growth.\nA summary of the activity in the valuation allowance is as follows:\n_______________\n(1)    Includes net charges to expense and allowances established due to acquisition.\nF-40\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nThe recoverability of the Company’s deferred tax assets has been assessed utilizing projections based on its current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on its current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, the Company believes that deferred tax assets, other than those for which a valuation allowance has been recorded, will be realized.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had net federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. If not utilized, the Company’s NOLs expire as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, is $\n103.6\nmillion and $\n94.8\nmillion, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes additions to the Company’s existing tax positions of $\n35.1\nmillion.\nThe Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The impact of the amount of such changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from\nzero\nto $\n18.0\nmillion.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:\n_______________\n(1)    Year ended December 31, 2021 includes adjustments of $(\n16.6\n) million due to a reclassification of unrecognized tax benefits to penalties and income tax-related interest expense.\n(2)    Year ended December 31, 2020 includes adjustments of $(\n21.0\n) million for positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition that were revised in connection with settlements or effective settlements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $\n23.1\nmillion in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions, which resulted in a decrease of $\n54.2\nmillion in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed and certain positions were effectively settled, including effective settlements and revisions of prior year positions related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition, which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $\n50.5\nmillion.\nThe Company recorded penalties and tax-related interest expense to the tax provision of $\n20.6\nmillion, $\n69.5\nmillion and $\n16.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions by $\n19.9\nmillion due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions by $\n14.6\nmillion and $\n4.8\nmillion, respectively, due to the expiration\nF-41\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nof the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions and certain positions that were effectively settled. In addition, as a result of a settlement in the United States, $\n45.8\nmillion was reclassified to Accrued income tax payable as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets were $\n43.3\nmillion and $\n42.3\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company has filed for prior taxable years, and for its taxable year ended December 31, 2022 will file, numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns, including U.S. federal and state tax returns and foreign tax returns. The Company is subject to examination in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years. As a result of the Company’s ability to carryforward federal, state and foreign NOLs, the applicable tax years generally remain open to examination several years after the applicable loss carryforwards have been used or have expired. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2022.\n13.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nSummary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans\n—The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The Company’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”), provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices for non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over four years for RSUs and stock options and\nthree years\nfor PSUs. Stock options generally expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of\n5.2\nmillion shares of common stock under the 2007 Plan. In connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, the Company assumed the remaining shares previously available for issuance under a plan approved by the CoreSite shareholders, which converted into\n1.4\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock. These shares will be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan, however, will only be available for grants to certain employees and will not be available for issuance beyond the period when they would have been available under the CoreSite plan, or March 20, 2023, at which time they will no longer be available for grant. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a\n15\n% discount from the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded the following stock-based compensation expenses:\n_______________\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense is included in selling, general, administrative and development expense.\n(2)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, stock-based compensation expense consisted of (i) $\n1.9\nmillion included in Property costs of operations, (ii) $\n1.1\nmillion included in Services costs of operations and (iii) $\n117.8\nmillion included in selling, general, administrative and development expense. For the year ended December 31, 2020, stock-based compensation expense capitalized as property and equipment was $\n1.7\nmillion.\nStock Options\n—There were\nno\noptions granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The fair values of previously granted stock options were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions at the date of grant.\nThe intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n34.3\nmillion, $\n176.7\nmillion and $\n176.3\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was\nno\nunrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options.

Vesting of RSUs is subject generally to the employee’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable RSU award agreement). In December 2021, in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, the Company assumed and converted certain equity awards previously\nF-43\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\ngranted by CoreSite under its equity plan into corresponding CoreSite Replacement Awards. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to the CoreSite Replacement Awards was $\n6.5\nmillion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately\none year\n.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units—\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”) granted an aggregate of\n98,542\nPSUs (the “2022 PSUs”) to its executive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of\n98,694\nPSUs (the “2021 PSUs”),\n110,925\nPSUs (the “2020 PSUs”), respectively, to its executive officers and established the performance metrics for these awards. During the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with the retirement of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, an aggregate of\n40,186\nshares underlying the 2020 PSUs were forfeited, which included the target number of shares issuable at the end of the\nthree-year\nperformance period for such executive’s 2020 PSUs.\nThreshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a\nthree-year\nperformance period with respect to each of the 2022 PSUs, the 2021 PSUs and the 2020 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when each award vests, which may range from\nzero\nto\n200\n% of the target amounts. At the end of each\nthree-year\nperformance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established performance goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of each performance period, subject generally to the executive’s continued employment or death, disability or qualified retirement (each as defined in the applicable PSU award agreement). PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares that actually vest.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $\n28.9\nmillion in stock-based compensation expense for equity awards in which the performance goals have been established and were probable of being achieved. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards at December 31, 2022 was $\n6.3\nmillion based on the Company’s current assessment of the probability of achieving the performance goals. The weighted-average period over which the cost will be recognized is approximately\ntwo years\n.\n14.\nEQUITY\nDividends\n—The Company may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock.\nSales of Equity Securities\n—The Company receives proceeds from sales of its equity securities pursuant to the ESPP and upon exercise of stock options granted under the 2007 Plan.

The Company records impairment charges to write down certain assets to their net realizable value after an indicator of impairment is identified and subsequent analysis determines that the asset is either partially recoverable or not recoverable. These assets consist primarily of those related to the Company’s tower locations, and included towers and related assets included in property and equipment, network location intangible assets and right-of-use assets, all of which are typically assessed on an individual location or site basis. The assets subject to impairment also include tenant-related intangibles, which are assessed on a tenant basis. Net losses on sales or disposals of assets primarily relate to certain non-core towers, other assets and miscellaneous items. Other operating expenses includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs.\nOther operating expenses included the following for the years ended December 31,:\n_______________\n(1)    For the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment charges primarily relate to India, as discussed below.\n(2)    For the year ended December 31, 2021, Other operating expenses includes acquisition and merger related expenses associated with the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition.

In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to the Company beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to the Company, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments.\nThe Company considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under its tenant leases when conducting its annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets in India. A probability weighted assessment was performed, incorporating current and expected industry and market conditions and trends and, as a result, the Company determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nAn impairment of $\n97.0\nmillion was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India.\n•\nThe Company also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $\n411.6\nmillion.\nF-48\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n17.\nEARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE\nThe following table sets forth basic and diluted net income per common share computational data for the years ended December 31, (shares in thousands, except per share data):\nShares Excluded From Dilutive Effect\nThe following shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, (in thousands, on a weighted average basis):\n18.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\n—The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nVerizon Transaction\n—In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”) that currently provides for the lease, sublease or management of approximately\n11,250\nwireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all communications sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately\n28\nyears, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately $\n5.0\nbillion. Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of\nten years\nwith\neight\noptional successive\nfive-year\nterms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction.\nAT&T Transaction\n—The Company has an agreement with SBC Communications Inc., a predecessor entity to AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), that currently provides for the lease or sublease of approximately\n1,900\ntowers commencing between December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Trust Securitizations. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately\n27\nyears, assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT&T. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has purchased an aggregate of more than\n500\nof the subleased towers which are subject to the applicable agreement, including\n143\ntowers purchased during the year ended December 31, 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of $\n93.2\nmillion. The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is $\n1.0\nbillion and includes per annum accretion through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites, AT&T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space through June 30, 2025 at the then-current monthly fee, which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT&T’s tenancy. Thereafter, AT&T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to\nfive\nsuccessive\nfive-year\nterms.\nF-49\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\nOther Contingencies\n—The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it holds assets or operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. Taxing authorities may issue notices or assessments while audits are being conducted. In certain jurisdictions, taxing authorities may issue assessments with minimal examination. These notices and assessments do not represent amounts that the Company is obligated to pay and are often not reflective of the actual tax liability for which the Company will ultimately be liable. In the process of responding to assessments of taxes that the Company believes are not enforceable, the Company avails itself of both administrative and judicial remedies. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification or assessment based on the information available and, in those instances in which the Company does not anticipate a successful defense of positions taken in its tax filings, a liability is recorded in the appropriate amount based on the underlying assessment.\nGuaranties and Indemnifications\n—The Company enters into agreements from time to time in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it agrees to guarantee or indemnify third parties for certain claims. The Company has also entered into purchase and sale agreements relating to the sale or acquisition of assets containing customary indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations under these agreements generally are limited solely to damages resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or covenants under the applicable agreements. In addition, payments under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to whatever defenses the Company may have and are governed by dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular agreement. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in duration and amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for payments made by the Company. The Company has not historically made any material payments under these agreements and, as of December 31, 2022, is not aware of any agreements that could result in a material payment.\n19.\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash investing and financing activities are as follows for the years ended December 31,:\n_______________\n(1)    For the year ended December 31, 2021, consists of the CoreSite Debt.

The Data Centers segment offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the existing property operating segment in the U.S. & Canada.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s property operations consisted of the following:\n•\nU.S. & Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\nF-50\nAMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)\n•\nAsia-Pacific: property operations in Australia, Bangladesh, India, New Zealand and the Philippines;\n•\nAfrica: property operations in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda;\n•\nEurope: property operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain;\n•\nLatin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n•\nData Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\nServices\n—The Company’s Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company’s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets.\nSummarized financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is shown in the following tables. The “Other” column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii)
