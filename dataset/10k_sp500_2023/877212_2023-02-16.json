The use of wireless voice, data, and video communications systems requires radio spectrum, which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”) regulate spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities, respectively. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of the radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union. We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies, these include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios, and portable or hand-held devices. Consequently, our results of operations could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time-to-time by the FCC, NTIA, or regulatory agencies in other countries. Our products operate both on the licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities, and consequently, the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also provide opportunities or may require modifications to some products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nSome of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local, and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Certain products are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. During 2022, compliance with U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment did not have a material effect on our business or results of operations.\nAvailable Information\nOur website address is www.zebra.com. The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, are made available free of charge on the Investor Relations page of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the SEC.\n12"

    "text": "Investors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties, and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in this report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and growth prospects. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. No priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.\nGeneral Business and Industry Risks\nThe Company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business\n. We have grown rapidly over the last several years both organically and through acquisitions. This growth has caused increased complexities in the business. We believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business. The following factors could present difficulties to us:\n•\nManaging our distribution channel partners and end-user customers;\n•\nManaging our contract manufacturing and supply chain;\n•\nManufacturing an increased number of products;\n•\nDeveloping and managing custom solutions offerings;\n•\nManaging parties to whom we have outsourced portions of our business operations;\n•\nManaging administrative and operational burdens;\n•\nManaging stakeholder interests including customer, investor and employee social responsibility matters;\n•\nMaintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth;\n•\nManaging the integration of acquisitions;\n•\nManaging logistical problems common to complex, expansive operations;\n•\nManaging our international operations; and\n•\nAttracting, developing and retaining individuals with the requisite technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products and solutions.\nInability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.\nOur ability to expand revenues, earnings, and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies. Acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms. Macroeconomic factors, such as rising inflation and interest rates, capital market volatility, etc., could negatively influence our future acquisition opportunities.\nThe Company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption. Acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results.\nWe may acquire or make investments in businesses, technologies, services, products, or solutions. An acquisition may present business issues which are new to us. The process of integrating any acquired business, technology, service, product, or solution into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention, which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business. These and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized.\nAcquisitions also may involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n•\nDifficulties and uncertainties in retaining the customers, distributors, vendors, or other business relationships from the acquired entities;\n•\nThe loss of key employees of acquired entities;\n•\nDisruptions in our business due to difficulties integrating and reorganizing operations, products, technologies and personnel;\n•\nThe ability of acquired entities to fulfill their customers’ obligations;\n•\nThe inheritance of known, and the discovery of unknown, issues or liabilities;\n•\nPre-closing and post-closing acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results and cash flows in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period;\n•\nThe failure of acquired entities to meet or exceed expected operating results or cash flows could result in impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired;\n13\n•\nThe ability to implement internal controls and accounting systems necessary to be compliant with requirements applicable to public companies subject to SEC reporting, which could result in misstated financial reports; and\n•\nFuture acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities.\nThe Company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change.\nTo be successful, we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products and solutions, as well as introducing new products, solutions, and services, to address user demands.\nThe Company’s industry is characterized by:\n•\nEvolving industry standards;\n•\nFrequent new product, solution, and service introductions;\n•\nEvolving distribution channels;\n•\nIncreasing demand for customized product and software solutions;\n•\nChanging customer demands; and\n•\nChanging security protocols.\nFuture success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment. We could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes, and may even be unable to adapt to these changes.\nThe Company participates in a competitive industry, which may become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements.\nThe markets that we serve are rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Some of our products, solutions and services are in direct competition with similar or alternative products, solutions and services provided by our competitors. In addition, we often compete with local competitors that may have a substantial advantage in attracting customers in their countries due to more established branding in that country, greater knowledge with respect to the tastes and preferences of customers residing in that country or their focus on a single market. Because of the potential for consolidation in any market, such competitors may become larger, and increased size could permit them to operate in wider geographic areas. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to effectively and economically:\n•\nIdentify and evolve with customer needs, emerging technologies, and industry trends;\n•\nMonitor disruptive technologies and business models;\n•\nInnovate, develop and timely commercialize new technologies, solutions, and services;\n•\nCompetitively price our products, solutions and services;\n•\nOffer superior customer service;\n•\nProvide products and solutions of high quality and reliability;\n•\nProvide dependable and efficient distribution networks; and\n•\nAttract, retain and develop employees with technical expertise and an understanding of our industry and customer needs.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or technologies. Current or future competitors are likely to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products, solutions and services that could cause a decline in market acceptance of our products, solutions or services, or result in the loss of major customers. Increased competition in our industry may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. In addition, we may not be able to effectively anticipate and react to new entrants in the marketplace competing with our products, solutions or services.\nFurther, as we expand into markets beyond our core products, we may face well established competitors, placing us at a disadvantage in a new competitive landscape. Some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products and solutions, which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace. An inability to compete successfully could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products, solutions and services outside of the U.S. and purchases important components, including final products, from suppliers located outside the U.S., many of whom with operations concentrated in China.\nShipments to non-U.S. customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of Net sales. We also expect to continue the use of third-party contract manufacturing services with non-U.S. production and assembly operations for our products.\n14\nRisks associated with operations, sales, and purchases outside the United States include:\n•\nFluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales, increase costs of purchasing, and affect collection of receivables outside of the U.S.;\n•\nVolatility in foreign credit markets may affect the financial well-being of our customers and suppliers;\n•\nViolations of anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, could result in large fines and penalties;\n•\nAdverse changes in, or uncertainty of, local business laws or practices, including the following:\n•\nImposition of burdensome tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers, or capital flow restrictions;\n•\nRestrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in, or purchase from, certain markets;\n•\nPolitical and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our assets at risk;\n•\nLimited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringement on our products or may cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories;\n•\nStaffing may be difficult including higher than anticipated turnover;\n•\nA government-controlled exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of currencies, including the Chinese Yuan;\n•\nTransportation delays and customs related delays may affect production and distribution of our products;\n•\nGeopolitical uncertainty or turmoil could negatively affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers;\n•\nDifficulty in effectively managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters; and\n•\nIntegration and enforcement of laws varies significantly among jurisdictions and may change over time.\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine and the global response to this war could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. On March 5, 2022, we suspended our business operations in Russia. While this suspension has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our operating results, it is not possible to predict the broader or long-term consequences of the war between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, cybersecurity conditions, currency exchange rates, financial markets and energy markets. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell and ship products, collect payments from and support customers in certain regions, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from supply chain and logistics challenges.\nThird parties may allege that the Company or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights.\nPeriodically, third parties claim that we or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights. As we continue to expand our business and incorporate new technologies into our products and solutions, these types of claims may increase. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. To the extent a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right is established, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and we may be required to pay costly judgments or settlements, enter into costly licensing arrangements or use a non-infringing method to accomplish our business objectives, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating margins.  See\nItem 3,\nLegal Proceedings\nfor additional information regarding current patent litigation.\nThe inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation, and our competitive position may be materially damaged.\nOur intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. We use copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and contracts to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or, without authorization, to misappropriate and use information we regard as trade secrets. Additionally, the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed. In any infringement litigation that the Company may undertake to protect our intellectual property, any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain, and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. Because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of the Company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies, software, and content developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe currently use third-party and/or open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products and solutions. Such parties ceasing continued development of the operating systems or restricting our access to such operating systems could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe are dependent on third-parties’ continued development of operating systems, software application ecosystem infrastructures, and such third-parties’ approval of our implementations of their operating systems and associated applications. If such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems, we would be required to change our strategy\n15\nfor such devices. Our financial results could be negatively impacted by a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult. A strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the Company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time, which could competitively disadvantage us. Some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies, software, and content developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems throughout the Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to distributors and customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, and other technical activities, and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications, and email. The Company stores confidential and proprietary information through cloud-based services that are hosted by third parties where we have less influence over security protocols. In addition, our customers may use certain of our products and solutions to transmit and/or process personal data and other sensitive information. Like many companies, we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business. We periodically perform vulnerability assessments, remediate vulnerabilities, review log/access, perform system maintenance, manage network perimeter protection, implement and manage disaster recovery testing, and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information. Despite our implementation of a variety of security controls and measures, as well as those of our third-party vendors, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident. Further, as cybercrime and threats continue to rapidly evolve and become increasingly more difficult to detect and defend against, our current security controls and measures may not be effective in preventing cybersecurity incidents and we may not have the capabilities to detect certain vulnerabilities. A cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Phishing and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat.\nCybersecurity incidents can take a variety of forms including, unintentional events as well as deliberate attacks by individuals, groups and sophisticated organizations, such as state sponsored organizations or nation-state actors.  Further, certain of our third party vendors have limited access to our employee and customer data and may use this data in unauthorized ways. Any such cybersecurity incident or misuse of our employees’ or customers’ data may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems, the loss or corruption of confidential business information, and/or the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand. This could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence.\nWhile we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents, there have been no material incidents incurred to-date at the Company. If our core business operations, or that of one of our third-party service providers, were to be breached, this could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data. Any failure on the part of us or our third-party service providers to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information, could result in: business disruption; damage to our reputation; financial obligations to third parties; fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings; private litigation with potentially large costs; deterioration in our suppliers’, distributors’, and customers’ confidence in us; as well as other competitive disadvantages. Such failures to maintain the security of data could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we continue to perform security due diligence, there is always the possibility of a significant breach.\nAny threats or security breaches to our systems may negatively impact our customers. Our products and solutions that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached, which could result in disclosure of a customer’s confidential information, or disrupt the availability of the customer’s data and systems. Further, our customers may fail to adopt adequate security controls and measures, or may fail to timely update their products and solutions to install or enable security patches, which may result in a security breach. The market perception of the effectiveness of our products and our reputation could also be harmed as a result of any actual or perceived security breach that occurs in our network or in the network of a customer of our products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the systems of other vendors or to actions of malicious parties. It is possible that such a breach, or a perceived breach, could result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products, solutions or services; diversion of our resources; injury to our reputation; theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages. To date, we have had no material incidents related to the security of our products or solutions. Further, strategic customers may negotiate specific controls and we may incur additional costs to comply with such customer-specific controls. Although we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient.\nWe may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects.\nWe have been subject to product liability claims, and may continue to be subject to such claims, including claims for property or economic damages or personal injury, where damages arose, and may continue to arise, from our products as a result of actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects. In addition, such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own\n16\ndesigned products, but also in components provided by third-party suppliers. We seek to limit such risk through insurance protection as well as product design, manufacturing quality control processes, product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers. Although there have been no material claims to-date at the Company, due to the growing size of the Company’s installed product base and growing number of applications in which our products can be used, an actual or alleged design or manufacturing defect could result in product recalls, injury to our reputation, and customer service costs or legal costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results.\nDefects or errors in the Company’s software products could harm our reputation, result in significant cost to us, and impair our ability to market such products.\nOur software may contain undetected errors, defects, or bugs. Although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors, defects, or bugs to date, we may discover significant errors, defects, or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner. Any future errors, defects, or bugs found in our software products and related services may result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products, solutions or services; diversion of resources; injury to reputation; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages; which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur business success depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate key personnel.\nOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by increased competition for highly skilled employees, higher employee turnover, or increased compensation and benefit costs. The future success of the Company is substantially dependent on the continued services and contributions of key personnel, including senior management and other highly skilled employees. The experience, industry knowledge, and skill sets of our employees materially benefit our operations and performance, and the ability to attract, retain, develop, and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our long-term success. Skilled employees in our industry are in high demand and competition for their experience and skill sets is intense. The incentives and benefits we have available to attract, retain, and motivate employees may become less effective as employees seek new or different opportunities based on factors such as compensation, benefits, mobility, and flexibility that are different from what we offer.  Although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not be able to continue to successfully attract, retain, develop, or motivate key personnel in the future. Any disruption in the services of key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA natural disaster, widespread public health issue, civil unrest, or man-made disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters or widespread public health issues, including pandemics, may occur in the future and the Company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations. The Company’s operations and facilities are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. Following an interruption to our business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe consequences of a natural disaster or widespread public health issue may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial results, and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has been, and continues to be, complex and rapidly evolving, and has impacted our business, with prior impacts primarily related to supply chain disruption (including higher fulfillment costs and component shortages) and labor constraints. The duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results depends on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the length of the pandemic, and the impact of these and other factors on our stakeholders.\nThe U.S. federal, state, and local governments as well as non-U.S. governments, to varying degrees, have imposed, and may again impose, several protocols and regulations restricting activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.  Over the course of the pandemic we have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and suppliers, including having the majority of office workers work remotely during the height of the pandemic and gradually returning to offices as restrictions are lifted, limiting employee travel where appropriate, and implementing more strenuous health and safety measures for hosting and attending in-person industry events. We continue to allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach, with modified business practices and increased health and safety protocols, consistent with government regulations and guidelines. However, there is no guarantee that such protocols will be successful in preventing the spread of COVID-19 amongst our employees, and even as employees return to our offices, we may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time. The extent and duration of future workplace restrictions and limitations, particularly in sites with significant headcount, could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute on strategic imperatives for our business. The potential negative\n17\neffects to our operations, including reductions in production levels, research and development activities, and increased efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, may adversely affect our ability to deliver our products, solutions and services.\nFurther, the conditions caused by COVID-19 have affected, and may continue to affect, the overall demand environment for our products, solutions and services. The level of demand for certain product components has resulted in, and may continue to result in, lengthened lead times and higher input costs, including freight. This has impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to meet customer demand as well as profitability.  An inability to meet customer demand may also adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our products, solutions or services.  Additionally, our financial results may be adversely impacted by challenges in the macroeconomic environment, including market inflation, as a result of global supply chain shortages.\nIf COVID-19 or its variants become more prevalent in the locations where our customers, suppliers, or we conduct business, we may experience more pronounced disruptions in our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected. Moreover, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other pre-existing risks, such as global economic conditions, political, regulatory, social, financial, operational and cybersecurity as well as similar risks relating to our suppliers and customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to risks under large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business.\nWe enter into large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts with our customers that expose us to risks, including among others: (i) technological risks, especially when contracts involve new technology; (ii) financial risks, including the accuracy of estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large, long-term contracts and the related impact on operating results; and (iii) cybersecurity risks, especially in solutions or managed services contracts with customers that process personal data. Recovery of front-loaded costs incurred on long-term managed services and software-based solutions contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers. The insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs.\nIf our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and require the Company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our subcontractors or suppliers, and other cost overruns, can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longer-term contracts.\nWe utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts, and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor.\nWe engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and our use of subcontractors has and may continue to increase as we expand our global solutions and services business. Our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply third-party products and software. We may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by a subcontractor and the functionality, warranty and indemnities of products, software, and services supplied by a subcontractor. We are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors, and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding back-to-back coverage from our subcontractors. Our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems, and services they supply, or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers, which might result in greater product returns, service problems, warranty claims and costs, and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair, distribution, engineering services, and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations, which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners.\nWe are not able to directly control certain business operations that we outsource. Our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service, cost reductions, or other metrics. In some cases, our outsource partners’ actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations, such as import or export regulations. As many of our outsource partners operate outside of the U.S., our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks. In addition, we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners. Once a business activity is outsourced, we may be contractually prohibited from, or may not practically be able to, bring such activity back within the Company or move it to another outsource partner. The actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results. Further, we have from time-to-time, and in certain instances will continue to, transition our outsourced operations to new service providers and/or to different geographies.  Such transition activities between new or existing outsource partners or across different geographies, as well as insourcing activities, could\n18\nresult in additional cost, time and management attention in order to effectively manage the transition, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nFailure of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business.\nIt is our policy to require suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and third-party sales representatives (“TPSRs”) to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including those regarding working conditions, employment practices, environmental compliance, anti-corruption, and trademark and copyright licensing. However, we do not control their labor and other business practices. If one of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, or TPSRs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled, relationships could be terminated, and our reputation could be damaged. If one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights, or patents, legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of the Company’s products and solutions, and expose us to financial obligations to a third-party. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers to sell many of our products, services and solutions, and their failure to effectively bring our products, services and solutions to market may negatively affect our results of operation and financial results.\nIn addition to our own sales force, we offer our products, services and solutions through a variety of third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers who may also market other products, services and solutions that compete with ours. Failure of one or more of our third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers to effectively promote our offerings could affect our ability to bring products, services and solutions to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Any changes to our channel program may cause some of our third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers to exit the program due to modifications to the program structure, which may reduce our ability to bring products and solutions to market and could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nSome of these third-parties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers and we are unable to successfully transition end-customers to purchase our products and solutions from other third-parties or from us directly, it may cause, and in some cases, has caused, a negative impact on our financial results.\nFinal assembly of certain of our products is performed by third-party electronics manufacturers. We may be dependent on these third-party electronics manufacturers as a sole-source of supply for the manufacture of such products. A failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require, or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shut-down, may adversely affect our business results. Because we rely on these third-party electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products, we may incur increased business continuity risks.\nWe are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products. If these third-party manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs, then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose sales, and be unable to maintain customer relationships. Longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand. Without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products, we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility. This transition could be costly and time consuming. We have taken actions to diversify, and may take additional actions to diversify in the future, our product sourcing footprint. Such actions have, and may again, result in additional costs.\nOur future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers. We source some of our components from sole source suppliers.  Any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies, inclusive of transportation costs, could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software from our suppliers, and our ability to deliver products, services and software to our customers. In addition, certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. If demand for our products, solutions or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for other reasons, including as a result of natural disasters, public health issues, severe weather conditions, or financial issues, we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business. We have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future. At times we have and may continue to execute multi-year purchase commitments with suppliers that contain minimum spend thresholds, which we are obligated to fulfill even if customer demand declines, and may require that we purchase inventory that exceeds our forecasted demand. In addition, volatility in customer demand, product availability, and costs to transport products, may result in increased operating input costs. Also, credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us, impacting our cash flow.\n19\nIn addition, our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and, therefore, not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies. Moreover, in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us, our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nThe impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the United States and corresponding actions by other countries in which the Company does business could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe Company currently imports a significant percentage of our products into the U.S., and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the Company’s financial performance. Although the Company has taken actions to\ndiversify its product sourcing footprint, these efforts may not be sufficient to mitigate negative impacts on the Company’s financial performance resulting from an increase in customs duties.\nTaxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves.\nWe are subject to, and may become subject to, ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. In addition, we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company’s effective tax rate and cash flows. Future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense, and cash flows.\nForecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates.\nForecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex, subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules, the results of examinations by various tax authorities, and the impact of any acquisition, business combination, disposition or other reorganization, or financing transaction.\nAs a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, tax laws and regulations, as well as multinational tax conventions. Many countries have recently adopted, or are considering the adoption of, revisions to their respective tax laws based on the on-going reports issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”)/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Project, which could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the U.S. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, and the availability of tax credits and carry-forwards. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.\nEconomic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations\n.\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may negatively impact our business.\nGeneral disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products, solutions or services by our customers. If a slowdown were severe enough, it could require further impairment testing and write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets. Cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges. A tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers, suppliers, outsourced manufacturers, and channel partners (e.g., distributors and resellers) from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases. An economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products, solutions and services; negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis; result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable; and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence. Higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against currencies such as the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Czech Koruna could negatively impact product sales, margins, and cash flows.\nIt is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage, we may be forced to retain the risk.\nWe have many types of insurance coverage and are also self-insured for some risks and obligations. Our third-party insurance coverage varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. In addition, our third-party insurance policies are subject to deductibles, policy limits, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis.\nFurther, certain types of coverages may be difficult or expensive to obtain. We self-insure against certain\n20\nbusiness risks and expenses where we believe we can adequately self-insure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed cost-effective or is not available. If the amount of our third-party insurance coverage is not available or adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident, incident, or claim. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n•\nWe may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness;\n•\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n•\nWe may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in the industry, including increased competition; and\n•\nWe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business.\nWe expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. Our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and/or principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our operating results\n. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness. To manage variable interest rate risk, we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements, which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan. Under generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the fair values of the swap contracts are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of “Interest expense, net” if not hedged. The associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates. If interest rates increase, we would have a non-cash gain on the swaps, and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates. Consequently, these swaps may introduce additional volatility to our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, business acquisition purchase price allocations, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, tax matters, and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. New accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or change our financial statements.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against the Company.\nAs part of our operations, the Company collects, uses, stores, and transfers personal data of third parties, employees and limited customer data in and across various jurisdictions. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of such personal\n21\ndata may result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against the Company. Existing laws and emerging regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government officials, regulators and privacy advocates are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data, which may result in new interpretations of existing laws that impact our business. Compliance with these laws may require us to, among other things, make changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that may result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms.\nFurther, there is no assurance that we will be able to meet additional requirements that may be imposed on the transfer of personal data without incurring expenses. We may experience reluctance or refusal by customers to purchase or continue to use our services due to concerns regarding their data protection obligations. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, may subject the Company to enforcement actions and regulatory investigations, claims, legal proceedings or other actions, reputational harm and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business.\nThe unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation, arbitration, or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time we are a party to litigation, arbitration, or administrative actions. Our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions, including those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, or other anti-corruption laws. There can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings. In addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws.\nOur operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products, solutions and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. Some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use, disposal, remediation, emission and discharge of, and exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault. We continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations. Environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance.\nLaws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories; recycling of both electronic products and packaging; reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products; and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly. Laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products, standardization of connectors and power supplies, the transportation of lithium-ion batteries, and other aspects are also proliferating. There are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety, radio interference, radio frequency radiation exposure, medical related functionality, and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment. These laws, and changes to these laws, could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products, solutions, and services, and on what capabilities and characteristics our products, solutions or services can or must include.\nThese laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively. We expect these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products, increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional accessibility.\nIncreased public awareness and worldwide focus on environmental and climate change issues has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and may result in more international, federal or regional requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming. ESG requirements and other increased regulation of climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions and require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices and/or product designs, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nFrom time to time, we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters. Identification, assessment, and disclosure of such matters is complex. Many of the statements in such voluntary disclosures are based on our expectations and assumptions, which may require substantial discretion and forecasts about costs and future circumstances. However, if our ESG practices or business portfolio do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, supplier, business partner, or acquiror could be negatively impacted. In addition, we note that certain ESG matters are becoming less “voluntary” as regulators, including the SEC, begin proposing and adopting regulations regarding ESG matters, including, but not limited to climate change-related matters. To the extent we are subject to increased regulatory requirements, we could become subject to\n22\nincreased compliance-related costs and risks, including potential enforcement and litigation. Such ESG matters may also impact our suppliers and customers, which may compound or cause new impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations."

    "text": "Beginning in September 2021, Honeywell filed patent infringement lawsuits against Zebra in multiple jurisdictions, including the International Trade Commission and Federal District Court in the Western District of Texas in the United States, as well as foreign courts in the United Kingdom, Germany, Netherlands, and China. Honeywell made substantially similar allegations of patent infringement in all cases filed. The technology addressed in the various actions generally includes aspects of data capture, barcode reading, and scanning. The allegedly infringing Zebra products identified in the actions were described as barcode scanners, mobile computers with barcode scanning capabilities, scan engines, and components thereof. The remedies sought in these lawsuits included damages and injunctive relief. The same Zebra products and technology were implicated in all of the lawsuits. Zebra vigorously defended against these infringement allegations. In February 2022, Zebra filed patent infringement lawsuits against Honeywell in multiple jurisdictions, including the International Trade Commission and Federal District Court in the Eastern District of New York in the United States, as well as foreign courts in the United Kingdom, Germany and China.  Zebra’s allegations against Honeywell in each case varied based on the underlying technology in the Zebra patent that is alleged to have been infringed by Honeywell. The technology addressed in the various actions includes scan engine functionality generally, distance scanning, power management and security. The Honeywell products that are accused of infringing Zebra’s patents in the various actions include scan engines and components thereof, barcode scanners, mobile computers, RFID printers and other wireless devices. The remedies sought in these lawsuits included damages and injunctive relief.  In June 2022, the parties resolved their disputes and entered into a License and Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”).  All pending matters between the parties were dismissed. The following are the relevant terms disclosed in Zebra’s Form 8-K filed on June 30, 2022: Under the Settlement, the Company and Honeywell each deny liability and agreed to a mutual general release from all past claims; entered into a covenant not to sue for patent infringement; agreed to a payment by the Company to Honeywell for past damages of $360 million which was charged in the Company’s second quarter 2022 results and will be paid in equal quarterly installments over eight quarters; and entered into a royalty-free cross-license with respect to each party’s existing patent portfolio for the lives of the licensed patents.\nSee Note 14,\nAccrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of certain other matters."

    "text": "This section generally discusses fiscal 2022 and 2021 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included herein.  Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 for that discussion.\nOverview\nThe Company is a global leader providing Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (“AIDC”) industry. The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices (“RFID”), barcode printing, and other workflow automation products and services.  The Company’s operations consist of two reportable segments that provide complementary offerings to our customers: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”). Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this document for additional information.\n•\nThe AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, including temperature-monitoring labels and services.\n•\nThe EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, RFID, fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, services, workflow optimization solutions and location solutions. Our workflow optimization solutions include cloud-based software subscriptions, retail solutions, and robotic automation solutions.\nDuring the past year, we have maintained our position as a market leader in our core businesses, which are generally considered to be comprised of our mobile computing and data capture products, printing products and supplies, as well as support and repair services. Customers across the industries that we serve have benefited from our core offerings to keep pace with the increasingly on-demand economy and to invest in their long-term technology capabilities.\nThe Company has continued to make strategic investments to accelerate progress in certain adjacent and expansion markets.  In June 2022, the Company acquired Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd. (“Matrox) for $881 million in cash, net of Matrox’s cash on-hand. Matrox, part of our EVM segment, is a leading provider of advanced machine vision components and software serving many end-markets. Through its acquisition of Matrox, the Company significantly expanded its machine vision products and software offerings.  The Company also continues to focus on scaling and integrating our other recent acquisitions (Antuit.ai, Fetch Robotics, Adaptive Vision Sp. z.o.o., and Reflexis) providing growth opportunities across our software and robotic solution offerings. These investments were funded partly through cash flow generation from our core businesses operations as well as through borrowings and other working capital facilities that enable us to maintain strong liquidity and manageable debt leverage.\nAs part of our ongoing supply chain optimization and resiliency initiatives, we extended the transition timeline of our distribution center in North America. The transition negatively impacted product fulfillment and operating results in the third quarter and contributed to elevated inventory levels. To mitigate the impacts associated with that transition, we resumed servicing customer orders through our existing logistics service provider. Additionally, in January 2023, we terminated our contractual arrangement with the new service provider and have directly assumed the distribution center lease and have staffed the facility with Zebra employees, hence assuming all operational activities at the location.\nWe are actively managing our inventory levels and have been addressing certain component part shortages through a combination of entering long-term supply commitments with key vendors, utilizing expedited modes of transportation, as well as executing select product re-designs. We anticipate inventory levels to remain elevated from historical levels as we continue to manage through supply chain challenges.\nMacroeconomic Environment\nThe acceleration of broad global cost inflation, a rising interest rate environment, and a stronger U.S. dollar in the current year have negatively impacted our operating results.  We have partially mitigated the financial impacts of these headwinds through a combination of targeted price increases, as well as our ongoing foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk management programs. We believe that this challenging operating environment, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia/Ukraine war, has contributed to a deceleration of certain customer demand, particularly late in the current year. The Company expects these macro conditions to persist into 2023.\n27\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we announced the suspension of our business operations in Russia. Neither Russia nor Ukraine comprises a material portion of our business; therefore, the war thus far has not had a significant effect on our results of operations. Additionally, the war has not significantly affected our ability to source supplies or deliver our products and services to our customers in the surrounding EMEA region. We will continue to monitor this for potential future adverse impacts on our business.\nIn 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant declines in customer demand and supply chain disruptions, which negatively impacted the Company’s Net sales and overall profitability.  In 2021, customer demand sharply rebounded as the underlying trend to digitize and automate workflows accelerated, which, along with pent-up demand from customers who we believe previously delayed purchases due to the pandemic, benefited the Company’s 2021 sales and profitability. The level of demand for certain product components resulted in lengthened lead times, component shortages, and higher input costs, including freight and component parts. Component shortages for certain products and elevated input costs continued in 2022 which negatively impacted our ability to meet customer demand and our operating results.\n2022 Financial Highlights and Other Recent Developments\n•\nNet sales were $5,781 million in the current year compared to $5,627 million in the prior year.\n•\nOperating income was $529 million in the current year compared to $979 million in the prior year.\n•\nNet income was $463 million, or $8.80 per diluted share in the current year, compared to Net income of $837 million, or $15.52 per diluted share in the prior year.\n•\nOperating cash flow was $488 million in the current year compared to $1,069 million in the prior year.\n•\nWe repurchased $751 million of common shares in the current year compared to $57 million in the prior year.\nRestructuring Activity\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Company committed to certain organizational changes and leased site rationalization actions designed to generate structural cost efficiencies (collectively referred to as the “2022 Productivity Plan”). The total cost under the 2022 Productivity Plan, which is expected to be completed in 2023, is estimated to be approximately $25 million. Exit and restructuring charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan were $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company incurred Exit and restructuring costs, under previously announced programs of $2 million, $7 million, and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLicense and Settlement Agreement\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company announced it entered into a License and Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”) resulting in a $372 million pre-tax charge, inclusive of $12 million of external legal fees, within Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Under the Settlement, Zebra agreed to pay $360 million to the counterparty in eight quarterly payments of $45 million which began in the second quarter. See Item 3,\nLegal Proceedings and Note 14, Accrued Liabilities, Commitments, and Contingencies\nfor additional information.\nChange in Segments\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the location solutions offering, which provides a range of RTLS and services that generate on-demand information about the physical location and status of high-valued assets, equipment, and people, moved from our AIT segment into our EVM segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business. We have reported our results reflecting this change, including historical periods, on a comparable basis. This change did not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n28\nResults of Operations: Year Ended 2022 versus 2021 and Year Ended 2021 versus 2020\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nNet sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages):\nOperating expenses are summarized below (amounts in millions, except percentages):\nConsolidated Organic Net sales growth:\n(1)\nOperating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.\n29\n(2)\nFor purposes of computing Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions.\n(3)\nConsolidated Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the\nNon-GAAP Measures\nsection at the end of this item.\n2022 compared to 2021\nTotal Net sales increased $154 million or 2.7% compared to the prior year as our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows. Net sales grew across both of our segments and most of our regions. Current year Net sales of both segments were negatively impacted by supply chain bottlenecks, which were particularly pronounced in our EVM segment. Prior year Net sales of both segments benefited from pent-up demand from customers who we believe delayed purchases in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the effects of currency changes and acquisitions, the increase in Consolidated Organic Net sales was 3.2%.\nGross margin decreased to 45.4% for the current year compared to 46.7% in the prior year. Gross margins were lower in both of our segments. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher premium freight and component part costs, the negative impact of foreign currency changes, unfavorable business mix, and lower support service margins, partially offset by targeted price increases. The prior year gross margin included the benefit of partial recovery of Chinese import tariffs.\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2,095 million and $1,649 million, or 36.2% and 29.3% of Net sales, respectively. Excluding the Settlement charge, Operating expenses were 29.8% of Net sales in the current year, with an increase over the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses and amortization of intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses, and increased employee travel, which were partially offset by lower employee incentive-based compensation.\nOperating income was $529 million for the current year compared to $979 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the Settlement charge.\nNet income decreased 44.7% compared to the prior year due to lower Operating income and a higher income tax rate, which were partially offset by favorability in Other income (expense), net as follows:\n•\nOther income (expense), net was income of $15 million for the current year, compared to an expense of $11 million in the prior year primarily due to the current year benefiting from an $83 million gain on interest rate swaps compared to a $13 million gain in the prior year, which was partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher average outstanding debt levels and interest rates in the current year.\n•\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were 14.9% and 13.5%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to settlements with tax authorities, unfavorable return to provision adjustments, and lower share-based compensation deductions.\nDiluted earnings per share decreased to $8.80 as compared to $15.52 in the prior year due to lower Net income, partially offset by lower average shares outstanding.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nThe following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in Note 20,\nSegment Information & Geographic Data\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs (such as the Settlement in the current year).\n30\nAsset Intelligence & Tracking Segment (“AIT”)\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nAIT Organic Net sales growth:\n(1)\nOperating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.\n(2)  AIT Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item.\n2022 compared to 2021\nTotal Net sales for AIT increased $79 million or 4.8% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of printing products (contributing the majority of the total increase), supplies, and support services. Current year Net sales included the benefit of targeted price increases as well as the negative effects of supply chain bottlenecks, while prior year Net sales benefited from pent-up demand from customers who we believe delayed purchases in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, AIT Organic Net sales growth was 6.7%.\nGross margin decreased to 43.0% in the current year compared to 45.8% in the prior year primarily due to higher premium freight and component part costs, the negative impact of foreign currency changes, and unfavorable business mix, partially offset by targeted price increases. The prior year gross margin included the benefit of partial recovery of Chinese import tariffs.\nOperating income decreased 5.8% in the current year compared to the prior year due to lower Gross profit and higher Operating expenses.\n31\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility Segment (“EVM”)\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nEVM Organic Net sales growth:\n(1)\nOperating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.\n(2)\nFor purposes of computing EVM Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to the acquisitions of Adaptive Vision, Fetch, Antuit, and Matrox are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions.\n(3)\nEVM Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the\nNon-GAAP Measures\nsection at the end of this item.\n2022 compared to 2021\nTotal Net sales for EVM increased $69 million or 1.7% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of data capture products, contributions from our recent acquisitions, and higher sales of support services, which were partially offset by lower sales of mobile computing products and unfavorable foreign currency changes. Current year Net sales included the benefit of targeted price increases as well as the negative impact of supply chain bottlenecks, while prior year Net sales benefited from pent-up demand from customers who we believe delayed purchases in fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency changes and acquisitions, EVM Organic Net sales growth was 1.7%.\nGross margin decreased to 46.4% in the current year compared to 47.2% in the prior year primarily due to higher premium freight and component part costs, unfavorable business mix, the negative impact of foreign currency changes, and lower support service margins, partially offset by targeted price increases. The prior year gross margin included the benefit of partial recovery of Chinese import tariffs.\nOperating income for the current year decreased 5.1% compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher Operating expenses.\n32\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers, cash payments to our suppliers, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated (in millions):\n2022 vs. 2021\nThe change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following:\n•\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher inventory levels, current year payments associated with the Settlement, and higher payments of 2021 incentive compensation. These items were partially offset by favorability in the timing of customer collections and accounts receivable factoring activity in the current year in comparison to the prior year.\n•\nCash used in investing activities was higher than the prior year primarily due to the $881 million acquisition of Matrox, with the prior year including cash payments of $453 million for the acquisitions of Antuit, Fetch, and Adaptive Vision.\n•\nCash provided by financing activities during the year included $1,037 million in net debt proceeds primarily related to the Company's debt refinancing activities in the second quarter, partially offset by $751 million of common stock repurchases. Cash used in financing activities in the prior year was primarily comprised of $257 million net debt repayments, $57 million of common stock repurchases, and $56 million of net payments related to share-based compensation.\nCompany Debt\nThe following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):\nIn May 2022, the Company refinanced its long-term credit facilities by entering into its third amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 3”). Amendment No. 3 increased the Company’s borrowing under Term Loan A from $875 million to $1.75 billion and increased the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Amendment No. 3 also extended the maturities of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility to May 25, 2027 and replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the benchmark reference rate.\n33\nTerm Loan A\nThe principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in March 2023 and the majority due upon maturity in 2027. The Company may make prepayments, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the Term Loan A interest rate was 5.67%.  Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Company has a Revolving Credit Facility that is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had letters of credit totaling $7 million, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1,500 million to $1,493 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 5.71%. Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 25, 2027.\nReceivables Financing Facilities\nThe Company has two Receivables Financing Facilities with financial institutions that have a combined total borrowing limit of up to $280 million. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under its Receivables Financing Facilities as secured borrowings. The Company’s first Receivables Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $180 million and matures on March 19, 2024. The Company’s second Receivable Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $100 million and matures on May 15, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $785 million of receivables that were pledged under the two Receivables Financing Facilities. As of December 31, 2022, $254 million had been borrowed, of which $171 million was classified as current. Borrowings under the Receivables Financing Facilities bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2022, the Receivables Financing Facilities had an average interest rate of 5.33%. Interest is paid on these borrowings on a monthly basis.\nSee Note 12,\nLong-Term Debt\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company’s debt instruments.\nReceivables Factoring\nThe Company currently has two Receivables Factoring arrangements, pursuant to which certain receivables are sold to banks without recourse in exchange for cash. One arrangement allows for the factoring of up to $25 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA region.  The second arrangement allows for the factoring of up to €150 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions.  Transactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangements are accounted for as sales under Accounting Standards Codification 860, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets, with the sold receivables removed from the Company’s balance sheet. Under these Receivables Factoring arrangements, the Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The banks’ purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Net cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 there were a total of $61 million and $24 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $130 million and $141 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Net cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSee Note 19,\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\n34\nShare Repurchases\nOn May 17, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. This authorization augments the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization which was announced on July 30, 2019. The newly authorized share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date. The level of the Company’s repurchases depends on a number of factors, including its financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors its management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 2,027,542 shares of common stock for approximately $751 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has cumulatively repurchased 3,323,283 shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion, resulting in a remaining amount of share repurchases authorized under the plans of $945 million. Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has repurchased 55,811 shares of common stock for approximately $15 million through February 9, 2023.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nWe believe that our Cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $105 million as of December 31, 2022, along with anticipated cash generation from operations and available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities, will be sufficient to fund the Company’s cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter based on our current business plans.\nIncluded in the Company’s Cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, which was $36 million and $39 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not expect that Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries will need to be repatriated in order to fund the Company’s U.S. operations based on current cash requirements.\nOur cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter include payments to satisfy the following obligations:\n•\nPurchase obligations — We have a limited number of multi-year purchase commitments, primarily related to semiconductors and cloud-services, which contain minimum purchase requirements and are non-cancellable. As of December 31, 2022, these commitments were approximately $557 million. This amount excludes routine purchase orders for good and services, as well as amounts already reflected within Accounts payable or Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 14,\nAccrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\n•\nDebt obligations — We expect to make total payments of approximately $237 million associated with the Company’s debt facilities in 2023. This expected use of cash is based on the Company’s current borrowings and applicable interest rates and margins as of December 31, 2022, and includes principal and interest payments along with expected cash settlements associated with the Company’s interest rate swaps. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may decide to borrow additional amounts or repay principal earlier than contractually owed, which would affect future cash payments.  See Note 12,\nLong-Term Debt\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company’s debt facilities.\n•\nLeases obligations — We lease certain manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, sales and administrative offices, equipment, and vehicles. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s fixed lease commitments totaled $243 million, of which $46 million is payable in 2023. See Note 13,\nLeases\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company’s lease arrangements.\nIn addition to the expected cash requirements described above, the Company may use cash to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, or repurchase common stock under its share repurchase program. We also expect to spend approximately $75 million to $85 million on capital expenditures in 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement prepared the consolidated financial statements of the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The application of these principles requires the use of estimates which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe that our estimates are reasonable based upon available information, actual results could differ substantially from those estimates. Note 2,\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional discussion of these items along with other significant accounting policies of the Company. The accounting estimates described below have been identified by Management as those that are most critical to our financial statements, as they require management to make significant judgments and assumptions about inherently uncertain matters.\n35\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate a provision or benefit for income taxes and amounts to be settled or recovered in several tax jurisdictions globally.  Our estimates are complex and involve significant judgments and interpretations of regulations. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for several years after completion of a given year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis, which requires estimation of our ability to generate future taxable income. In particular, our income tax provision or benefit is dependent on our ability to forecast future taxable income in the U.S., U.K., Singapore, and other jurisdictions. Significant judgments included in our forecasts include projecting future sales volumes and pricing, costs to manufacture and procure products and to deliver services and solutions, among other factors. There were no significant changes in estimates to our income tax provision during the current year.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The estimates used to determine the fair values of long-lived intangible assets can be complex and require judgment. We generally value intangible assets using income-based valuation methodologies, such as the excess earnings method, which require critical estimates that include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from revenues and the determination of discount rates.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill impairment testing consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value. Fair value determinations require judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, as well as market factors. We estimate the fair value of reporting units using both income and market-based valuation approaches. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires that we make assumptions and estimates including projections of revenue and income growth rates as well as cash flows; capital investments; competitive and customer trends; appropriate peer group selection; market-based discount rates and other market factors. Our annual quantitative impairment test, most recently completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, continues to indicate that the fair values of each of our reporting units significantly exceed their respective carrying values.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods, solutions or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive.  The consideration that we expect to receive is estimated by reflecting reductions to our transaction price for product returns, rebates, and other incentives.  These estimates are developed using the expected value that the Company anticipates receiving and are based on recent trends observed in similar transactions.  Additionally, some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, including various hardware, software, and/or services.  For such contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the estimated total transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”).  The determination of SSP is established at a regional level.  SSP is based on observable prices in recent standalone transactions for the same or similar offerings, to the extent available, which is often applicable to tangible products and software licenses.  Alternatively, in the absence of recent observable prices, the Company generally applies the expected cost-plus margin approach to professional services, repair and maintenance services, and solution offerings.  There were no changes to our estimation processes for consideration received or SSP that materially affected revenues during the year.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2,\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures – Consolidated Organic Net sales growth, AIT Organic Net sales growth, and EVM Organic Net sales growth – are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, as applicable. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures presented.\n36"

    "text": "Market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency changes. Zebra is primarily exposed to the following types of market risk: interest rate and foreign currency.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Our exposures include the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). We use interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to mitigate the majority of the Company’s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally, under these interest rate swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange floating-rate for fixed-rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount.\nThe United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced in 2017 the phase out of LIBOR. We continue to closely monitor the phase out of LIBOR to assess any impacts to our debt and interest rate swap contracts. We have already taken actions to amend certain contracts to incorporate a SOFR benchmark rate, and we expect other key contracts will be amended to incorporate a SOFR benchmark rate before the LIBOR phase out is completed. As of December 31, 2022, our remaining contracts containing exposure to LIBOR pertain only to LIBOR tenors that will be phased out by June 30, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.0 billion of debt outstanding under our debt facilities, which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $12 million. This exposure includes the impact of associated forward interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities.  Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent that the Company’s borrowings under its debt facilities increase or decrease, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe provide products, solutions and services in approximately 190 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. In some instances, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging activities.\nThe currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Czech Koruna. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $2 million. This amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts.\n37"

    "text": "INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n38\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Zebra Technologies Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n39\nAcquisition of Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd. – Valuation of Intangible Assets\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 16, 2023\n40\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share data)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n41\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share data)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n42\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n43\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions, except share data)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n44\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n45\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1\nDescription of Business and Basis of Presentation\nZebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Zebra” or the “Company”) is a global leader providing innovative Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the automatic identification and data capture solutions industry. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products and solutions, including cloud-based software subscriptions, that capture and move data. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, managed and professional services. End-users of our products, solutions and services include those in retail and e-commerce, manufacturing, transportation and logistics, healthcare, public sector, and other industries. We provide our products, solutions and services globally through a direct sales force and an extensive network of channel partners.\nEffective January 1, 2022, the location solutions offering, which provides a range of real-time location systems (“RTLS”) and services that generate on-demand information about the physical location and status of assets, equipment, and people, moved from our Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) segment into our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”) segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business. We have reported our results reflecting this change, including historical periods, on a comparable basis. This change does not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  See Note 20,\nSegment Information & Geographic Data\nfor additional information related to each segment’s results.\nNote 2\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and include the accounts of Zebra and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFiscal Calendar\nThe Company’s fiscal year is a 52-week period ending on December 31. Interim fiscal quarters end on a Saturday and generally include 13 weeks of operating activity. During the 2022 fiscal year, the Company’s quarter end dates were April 2, July 2, October 1, and December 31.\nUse of Estimates\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples of accounting estimates include: cash flow projections and other valuation assumptions included in business acquisition purchase price allocations as well as annual goodwill impairment testing; the measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions; inventory valuation; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists primarily of deposits with banks. In addition, the Company considers highly liquid short-duration term deposits with banks, as well as other highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months, to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of a change in value because of changes in interest rates.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our customers in the normal course of business. Collateral on trade accounts receivable is generally not required. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable that is based on expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are estimated based on historical loss experience, the durations of outstanding trade receivables, and expectations of the future economic environment. Accounts are written off against the allowance account when they are determined to be no longer collectible.\n46\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of a moving-average cost (which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis) and net realizable value. Manufactured inventory cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Purchased inventory cost also includes internal purchasing overhead costs. Raw material inventories largely consist of supplies used in repair operations. Provisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Inventory provisions are based on forecasted demand, experience with specific customers, the age and nature of the inventory, and the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or to rework into other consumable inventory.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property, plant and equipment, which are\nthirty years\nfor buildings and range from\nthree\nto\nten years\nfor all other asset categories. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or\nten years\n.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for its lease commitments with terms greater than one year. Contractual options to extend or terminate lease agreements are reflected in the lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The initial measurements of new ROU assets and lease liabilities are based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date. In determining future lease payments, the Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components. As the Company’s lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, we apply the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. Relevant information used in determining the Company’s incremental borrowing rate includes the duration of the lease, transaction currency of the lease, and the Company’s credit risk relative to risk-free market rates. The Company’s ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and exclude lease incentives. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. All leases of the Company are classified as operating leases, with lease expense being recognized on a straight-line basis.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740 Topic,\nIncome Taxes\n. Accordingly, deferred income taxes are provided for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes the benefit of tax positions when it is more likely than not to be sustained on its technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense. The Company has elected consolidated tax filings in certain of its jurisdictions which may allow the group to offset one member’s income with losses of other members in the current period and on a carryover basis. The income tax effects of non-inventory intra-entity asset transfers are recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs. The Company classifies its balance sheet accounts by applying jurisdictional netting principles for locations where consolidated tax filing elections are in place.\nU.S. tax law contains the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (“BEAT”), and Deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) provisions, which relate to the taxation of certain foreign income. The Company recognizes its GILTI, BEAT, and FDII inclusions, when applicable, within income tax expense in the year included in its U.S. tax return.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Our annual impairment testing consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be considered to be impaired and reduced to its implied fair value. We estimate the fair value of reporting units with valuation techniques, including both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate projected future operating and cash flow results, economic projections, and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry group.\nWe most recently performed our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2022 using a quantitative approach which did not result in any impairments.\nSee Note 6,\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nfor additional information.\n47\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of technology and patent rights, customer and other relationships, and trade names.  These assets, which are generally acquired through business combinations, are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset’s useful life which typically range from\ntwo\nto\neleven years\n.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of\nThe Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360,\nProperty, Plant and Equipment,\nwhich\nrequires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset. If such assets are impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nInvestments in Securities\nThe Company’s investments primarily include equity securities that are accounted for at cost, adjusted for impairment losses or changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. These investments are primarily in venture capital backed technology companies where the Company's ownership interest is less than 20% and the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence.\nSee Note 8,\nInvestments\nfor additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are primarily comprised of sales of hardware, supplies, services, solutions and software offerings. We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive, which includes estimates of variable consideration, in exchange for those goods or services. We are typically the principal in all elements of our transactions and record Net sales and Cost of sales on a gross basis.\nSubstantially all revenues for tangible products, supplies and perpetual or term software licenses are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment, when control and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, and the Company has a contractual right to payment.  Revenues for our service offerings are recognized over time.  Our service offerings include repair and maintenance service contracts, as well as professional services such as installation, integration and provisioning that typically occur in the early stages of a project.  The average life of repair and maintenance service contracts is approximately three years.  Professional service arrangements range in duration from a day to several weeks or months.  Revenues for solutions, including Company-hosted software license and maintenance agreements, are typically recognized over time.\nThe Company elects to exclude sales and other governmental taxes that are collected by the Company from a customer, from the transaction price  The Company also considers shipping and handling activities as part of its fulfillment costs and not as a separate performance obligation.\nSee Note 3,\nRevenues\nfor additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development (“R&D”) costs include:\n•\nSalaries, benefits, and other R&D personnel related costs;\n•\nConsulting and other outside services used in the R&D process;\n•\nEngineering supplies;\n•\nEngineering related information systems costs; and\n•\nAllocation of building and related costs.\nR&D costs are expensed as incurred, including those associated with developing and maintaining software within our customer offerings.  The Company typically applies a dynamic and iterative approach to developing customer product and software offerings as well as ongoing software feature and functionality enhancement releases, and accordingly, such costs do not meet capitalization criteria.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nThese costs totaled $\n33\nmillion, $\n35\nmillion, and $\n25\nmillion for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n48\nWarranties\nIn general, the Company provides warranty coverage of\none year\non mobile computers and batteries. Printers are warrantied from\none\nto\ntwo years\n, depending on the model. Advanced data capture products are warrantied from\none\nto\nfive years\n, depending on the product. Thermal printheads are warrantied for\nsix months\nand battery-based products, such as location tags, are covered by a\n90-day\nwarranty. A provision for warranty expense is adjusted quarterly based on historical and expected warranty experience.\nContingencies\nThe Company establishes a liability for loss contingencies when the loss is both probable and estimable. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, a reliable estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss cannot be determined, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value generally include our employee deferred compensation plan investments, foreign currency forwards, and interest rate swaps. In accordance with ASC Topic 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n(“ASC 815”)\n,\nwe recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Accounting for the gains and losses on our derivatives resulting from changes in fair value is dependent on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.\nThe Company utilizes foreign currency forwards to hedge certain foreign currency exposures.  We use broker quotations or market transactions, in either the listed or over-the-counter markets, to value our foreign currency exchange contracts.  The Company also has interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the variability in future cash flows on debt.  We use relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves and the Company’s own credit risk, to value our interest rate swaps.  See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor additional information on the Company’s derivatives and hedging activities.\nThe Company’s securities held for its deferred compensation plans are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. If active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those financial instruments.\nSee Note 10,\nFair Value Measurements\nfor information related to financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company has share-based compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan under which shares of Class A Common Stock are available for future grant and purchase. The Company recognizes compensation costs over the vesting period of awards, which is typically\nthree years\n, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation costs associated with awards with graded vesting terms are recognized on a straight-line basis.\nSee Note 15,\nShare-Based Compensation\nfor additional information.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe balance sheet accounts of the Company’s subsidiaries that have not designated the U.S. Dollar as its functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using the period-end exchange rate, and statement of earnings items are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation gains or losses are recorded in Stockholders’ equity as a cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of AOCI within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, generally measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.\nThe estimates used to determine the fair values of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require judgment. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from revenues and the determination of discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based on estimates and assumptions utilized as part of the purchase price allocation process and are believed to be reasonable; however elements of these estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement during the measurement period, which is up to one year after the acquisition date.\n49\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company did not adopt any material new accounting standards during the year ended December 31, 2022\n.\nNote 3\nRevenues\nThe Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive for providing those goods or services. To determine total expected consideration, the Company estimates elements of variable consideration, which primarily include product rights of return, rebates, and other incentives.  These estimates are developed using the expected value method and are reviewed and updated, as necessary, at each reporting period.  Revenues, inclusive of variable consideration, are recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in future periods.\nWe enter into contracts that may include combinations of tangible products, services, solutions and software offerings, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. We evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract has more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires judgment, and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple distinct performance obligations may impact the amount of revenue recorded in a reporting period.  We deem performance obligations to be distinct if the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with readily available resources (“capable of being distinct”) and if the transfer of products, solutions or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (“distinct within the context of the contract”).\nFor contract arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices for each performance obligation. In general, standalone selling prices are observable for tangible products and software licenses, while standalone selling prices for professional services, repair and maintenance services, and solutions are developed primarily with an expected cost-plus margin approach. Regional pricing, marketing strategies, and business practices are evaluated to derive estimated standalone selling prices.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for each performance obligation upon transfer of control of the promised goods or services. Control is deemed to have been transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and has obtained substantially all of the remaining benefits from the goods and services. The determination of whether control transfers at a point in time or over time requires judgment and includes our consideration of the following: 1) whether the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the Company performs its promises; 2) whether the Company’s performance creates or enhances an asset that is under control of the customer; and 3) whether the Company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, while the Company has an enforceable right to payment for its performance completed to date.\nRevenues for products are generally recognized upon shipment, whereas revenues for services and solution offerings are generally recognized over time by using an output or time-based method, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenues for software are recognized either upon delivery or over time using a time-based method, depending upon how control is transferred to the customer. In cases where a bundle of products, services, solutions and/or software are delivered to the customer, judgment is required to select the method of progress which best reflects the transfer of control.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents our Net sales disaggregated by product category for each of our segments, AIT and EVM, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n50\n(1) Amounts included in Corporate eliminations consist of purchase accounting adjustments.\nIn addition, refer to Note 20,\nSegment Information & Geographic Data\nfor Net sales to customers by geographic region.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations primarily relate to repair and support services, as well as solution offerings. The aggregated transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for arrangements with an original term exceeding one year was $\n1,105\nmillion and $\n1,033\nmillion, inclusive of deferred revenue, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On average, remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are expected to be recognized over a period of approximately\ntwo years\n.\nContract Balances\nProgress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers related to billed revenues is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accounts receivable, net.  Progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers related to unbilled revenues (“contract assets”) is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets for revenues expected to be billed within the next twelve months, and Other long-term assets for revenues expected to be billed thereafter. The total contract asset balances were\n$\n16\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These contract assets result from timing differences between billing and satisfying performance obligations, as well as the impact from the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations for contracts that include multiple performance obligations. Contract assets are evaluated for impairment and\nno\nimpairment losses have been recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nDeferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets consists of payments and billings in advance of our performance. The combined short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances were $\n758\nmillion and $\n695\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recognized $\n399\nmillion, $\n319\nmillion and $\n256\nmillion in revenue that was previously included in the beginning balance of deferred revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products, solutions or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nOur incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist of sales commissions and incremental fringe benefits, are deferred and amortized over the weighted-average contract term. The incremental costs to obtain a contract are derived at a portfolio level and amortized on a straight-line basis.\nThe total ending balance of deferred commission costs, which are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the timing of expected amortization, was $\n35\nmillion and $\n28\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization of deferred commission costs, which is recorded in Selling and Marketing expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $\n21\nmillion, $\n18\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred if the amortization period would otherwise be one year or less.\n51\nNote 4\nInventories\nThe components of Inventories, net are as follows (in millions):\nNote 5\nBusiness Acquisitions\nMatrox\nOn June 3, 2022, the Company acquired Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd. (“Matrox”), a developer of advanced machine vision components and software. Through its acquisition of Matrox, the Company significantly expanded its machine vision products and software offerings.\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The Company’s final purchase consideration was $\n881\nmillion comprised of cash paid, net of Matrox’s cash on-hand.\nThe Company utilized estimated fair values as of the acquisition date to allocate the total purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the net assets acquired was based on several estimates and assumptions, as well as customary valuation techniques, primarily the excess earnings method for customer relationships as well as the relief from royalty method for technology and patent intangible assets. While we believe these estimates provide a reasonable basis to record the net assets acquired, the purchase price allocation is considered preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date.\nThe primary fair value estimates still considered preliminary as of December 31, 2022 include intangible assets and income tax-related items.\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows (in millions):\nThe $\n640\nmillion of goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes, has been allocated to the EVM segment and principally relates to the planned global expansion and integration of Matrox into the Company’s machine vision offerings.\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired was as follows:\n52\nIn connection with the acquisition of Matrox, the Company granted $\n13\nmillion of cash-settled RSUs to certain employees in the second quarter, which are attributable to service to be rendered subsequent to the acquisition and will generally be expensed over a\n3-year\nservice period.\nAntuit\nOn October 7, 2021, the Company acquired Antuit Holdings Pte.

These costs are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n55\nNote 6\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill\nChanges in the net carrying value of goodwill by segment were as follows (in millions):\nSee Note 5,\nBusiness Acquisitions\nfor further details related to the Company’s acquisitions and purchase price allocation adjustments.\nThe Company’s goodwill balance consists of\nfour\nreporting units. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2022 utilizing a quantitative approach. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeds its carrying value. However, there is risk of future impairment to the extent that an individual reporting unit’s performance does not meet projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors are not met, or if other valuation factors outside of our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair value of our reporting units could be adversely affected, leading to a potential impairment in the future.\nNo events occurred during the fiscal years ended 2022, 2021, or 2020 that indicated it was more likely than not that our goodwill was impaired.\nOther Intangibles, net\nThe balances in Other Intangibles, net consisted of the following (in millions):\n56\nAmortization expense was $\n136\nmillion, $\n115\nmillion, and $\n78\nmillion for fiscal years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEstimated future intangible asset amortization expense is as follows (in millions):\nNote 7\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, net is comprised of the following (in millions):\nDepreciation expense was $\n68\nmillion, $\n72\nmillion and $\n68\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNote 8\nInvestments\nThe carrying value of the Company’s long-term investments was $\n113\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balances Sheets. The Company paid $\n12\nmillion, $\n34\nmillion, and $\n32\nmillion for the purchases of long-term investments during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Net gains and losses related to the Company’s long-term investments are included within Other (expense) income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were\nno\nnet gains in the year ended December 31, 2022. Net gains were $\n2\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNote 9\nExit and Restructuring Costs\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Company committed to certain organizational changes and leased site rationalization designed to generate structural cost efficiencies (collectively referred to as the “2022 Productivity Plan”). The total cost under the 2022 Productivity Plan, which is expected to be completed in 2023, is estimated to be approximately $\n25\nmillion. Exit and restructuring charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan were $\n12\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company incurred Exit and restructuring costs, under previously announced programs of $\n2\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nNote 10\nFair Value Measurements\nFinancial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820,\nFair Value Measurements\n. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer\n57\na liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into the following three broad levels:\n•\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs (e.g. U.S. Treasuries and money market funds).\n•\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets but corroborated by market data.\n•\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs to the extent possible. In addition, the Company considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2022 are classified below (in millions):\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2021 are classified below (in millions):\n(1)\nThe fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is calculated as follows:\n•\nFair value of regular forward contracts associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points.\n•\nFair value of hedges against net assets denominated in foreign currencies is calculated at the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points unless the hedge has been traded but not settled at year end (Level 2). If this is the case, the fair value is calculated at the rate at which the hedge is being settled (Level 1).\n(2)\nThe fair value of forward interest rate swaps is based upon a valuation model that uses relevant observable market inputs at the quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves, and is adjusted for the Company’s credit risk and the interest rate swap terms.\nNote 11\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to such risks and may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under ASC Topic 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n(“ASC 815”). The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n58\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures them at fair value.\nThe following table presents the fair value of its derivative instruments (in millions):\nThe following table presents the net gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges (in millions):\nActivities related to derivative instruments are reflected within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCredit and Market Risk Management\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk of nonperformance and to market risk related to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit standards, diversifying its counterparties, and monitoring its concentrations of credit. The Company’s counterparties are commercial banks with expertise in derivative financial instruments. The Company evaluates the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments by considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of the customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company’s credit policies are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk.\nThe Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. We present the assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments, for which we have net settlement agreements in place, on a net basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative financial instruments had been presented gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions would have been increased by $\n4\nmillion as of December 31, 2022 and would have been increased by $\n1\nmillion as of December 31, 2021.\n59\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk Management\nThe Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a variety of foreign currencies. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises primarily from Euro-denominated external revenues, cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries, and foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company manages its objective of preserving the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows by initially hedging transaction exposures with natural offsets and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts, as deemed appropriate.\nThe Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated Euro-denominated sales using forward contracts, which typically mature within\ntwelve months\nof execution. The Company designates these derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the contract is settled and the hedged sale is realized. The realized gain or loss is then recorded as an adjustment to Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized amounts reclassified to\nNet sales\nwere $\n87\nmillion of gains for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $\n2\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion of losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amounts of the Company’s foreign exchange cash flow hedges were €\n549\nmillion and €\n675\nmillion, respectively. The Company has reviewed its cash flow hedges for effectiveness and determined that they are highly effective.\nThe Company uses forward contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to manage its exposures related to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. These forward contracts typically mature within\none month\nafter execution. Monetary gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in income and are generally offset by the transaction gains and losses related to their net asset positions.\nThe notional values and the net fair values of these outstanding contracts were as follows (in millions):\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company’s debt consists of borrowings under a term loan (“Term Loan A”), Revolving Credit Facility, and Receivables Financing Facilities, which bear interest at variable rates plus applicable margins. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with the variable interest rate payments on these borrowings. See Note 12,\nLong-Term Debt\nfor further details related to these borrowings.\nThe Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by utilizing long-term forward interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. The Company had\none\nactive long-term forward interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $\n800\nmillion to lock into a fixed LIBOR interest rate base, which expired in December 2022. In addition, the Company previously held fixed LIBOR interest rate swaps with an $\n800\nmillion total notional amount that were subject to net cash settlements effective between December 2022 and August 2024. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company terminated those interest rate swaps and entered into new interest rate swap agreements that contain a total notional amount of $\n800\nmillion to lock into a fixed SOFR interest rate base, which is subject to monthly net cash settlements effective in December 2022 and ending in October 2027.\n60\nNote 12\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022, the future maturities of debt are as follows (in millions):\nAll borrowings as of December 31, 2022 were denominated in U.S. Dollars.\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s debt approximated $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fair value amounts, developed based on inputs classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, represent the estimated value at which the Company’s lenders could trade its debt within the financial markets and do not represent the settlement value of these liabilities to the Company. The fair value of debt will continue to vary each period based on a number of factors, including fluctuations in market interest rates as well as changes to the Company’s credit ratings.\nIn May 2022, the Company refinanced its long-term credit facilities by entering into its third amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 3”). Amendment No. 3 increased the Company’s borrowing under Term Loan A from $\n875\nmillion to $\n1.75\nbillion and increased the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $\n1\nbillion to $\n1.5\nbillion. Amendment No. 3 also extended the maturities of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility to May 25, 2027 and replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the benchmark reference rate. This refinancing resulted in one-time charges of $\n2\nmillion, which included certain third-party fees and the accelerated amortization of previously deferred issuance costs. These items are included in Interest income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, $\n6\nmillion of new issuance costs and fees were deferred and will be amortized over the remaining term of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility.\nTerm Loan A\nThe principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in March 2023 and the majority due upon maturity in 2027. The Company may make prepayments, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December 31, 2022, the Term Loan A interest rate was\n5.67\n%.  Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Company has a Revolving Credit Facility that is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had letters of credit totaling $\n7\nmillion, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $\n1,500\nmillion to $\n1,493\nmillion. As of December 31, 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of\n5.71\n%. Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 25, 2027.\n61\nReceivables Financing Facilities\nThe Company has\ntwo\nReceivables Financing Facilities with financial institutions that have a combined total borrowing limit of up to $\n280\nmillion. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under its Receivables Financing Facilities as secured borrowings.  The Company’s first Receivables Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $\n180\nmillion and matures on March 19, 2024. The Company’s second Receivable Financing Facility allows for borrowings of up to $\n100\nmillion and matures on May 15, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $\n785\nmillion of receivables that were pledged under the\ntwo\nReceivables Financing Facilities. As of December 31, 2022, $\n254\nmillion had been borrowed, of which $\n171\nmillion was classified as current. Borrowings under the Receivables Financing Facilities bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2022, the Receivables Financing Facilities had an average interest rate of\n5.33\n%. Interest is paid on these borrowings on a monthly basis.\nEach of the Company’s borrowing arrangements described above include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with its debt. See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor further information.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nNote 13\nLeases\nThe Company leases various manufacturing and repair facilities, distribution centers, research facilities, sales and administrative offices, equipment, and vehicles. All leases are classified as operating leases with remaining terms of up to\n10\nyears, with certain leases containing renewal options and termination options. The Company records ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with the fixed lease and non-lease payments of leases with terms greater than one year.\nThe following table presents activities associated with our leases (in millions):\nVariable lease expenses incurred were not included in the measurement of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities. These expenses consisted primarily of distribution center service costs that were based on product distribution volumes, as well as non-fixed common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other operating costs associated with various facility leases.  Expenses related to short-term leases were not significant.\nCash payments for leases are included within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations include new lease arrangements entered into by the Company as well as contract modifications that extend lease terms and/or provide us additional rights, changes in assessments that render it reasonably certain that lease renewal options will be exercised based on facts and circumstances that arose during the period, as well as lease arrangements obtained through acquisitions.\n62\nReductions of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities generally relate to modifications to lease agreements that result in a reduction to future minimum lease payments, as well as changes in assessments that render it no longer reasonably certain that lease renewal options will be exercised based on facts and circumstances that arose during the period. The Company’s reduction of ROU assets and lease liabilities during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not significant.\nThe weighted average remaining term of the Company’s leases was approximately\n6\nyears each as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The weighted average discount rate used to measure the ROU assets and lease liabilities was approximately\n5\n% each as of December 31, 2022,  2021, and 2020.\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases as of December 31, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nThe current portion of lease liabilities is included within\nAccrued liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had future fixed payments of approximately $\n36\nmillion related to a new office facility lease agreement that had not yet commenced. This new lease agreement is expected to commence in 2023 and has a\n10\n-year term.\nRevenues earned from lease arrangements under which the Company is a lessor during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not significant.\nNote 14\nAccrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies\nAccrued Liabilities\nThe components of Accrued liabilities are as follows (in millions):\n63\nWarranties\nThe following table is a summary of the Company’s accrued warranty obligations (in millions):\nCommitments\nThe Company has a limited number of multi-year purchase commitments, primarily related to semiconductors and cloud-services, which contain minimum purchase requirements and are non-cancellable. Commitments under these contracts are as follows (in millions):\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to a variety of investigations, claims, suits, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to, intellectual property, employment, tort, and breach of contract matters. The Company currently believes that the outcomes of such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company’s view of these matters and their potential effects may change in the future. The Company records a liability for contingencies when a loss is deemed to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nIn 2020, the Company received approval of its exclusion request of customs duties that had been paid on certain products under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 from September 1, 2019 through September 1, 2020 and commenced a process to request recovery of previously assessed amounts. Recoveries are recognized when the Company has completed all regulatory filing requirements and determined that receipt of amounts is virtually certain. Recoveries recorded during the current year were insignificant. Recoveries totaling $\n19\nmillion were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021, of which $\n10\nmillion related to our AIT segment and $\n9\nmillion related to our EVM segment. Recoveries totaling $\n12\nmillion were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which $\n4\nmillion related to our AIT segment and $\n8\nmillion related to our EVM segment. Both the initially incurred costs and related recoveries were included within Cost of sales for Tangible products on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company believes that it has recovered substantially all of the import duties that it expects to receive on previously paid amounts.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a License and Settlement Agreement (“Settlement”) to resolve certain patent-related litigation. Under the Settlement, the Company and the counterparty each agreed to a mutual general release from all past claims asserted by the parties; entered into a covenant not to sue for patent infringement; agreed to a payment by the Company to the counterparty for past damages of $\n360\nmillion and entered into a royalty-free cross-license with respect to each party’s existing patent portfolio for the lives of the licensed patents. Based on the terms of the Settlement and a relative fair value analysis of each of the settlement provisions, the Company concluded that no significant portion of the payment resulted in a future benefit, and as such, the full $\n360\nmillion was recorded as a charge in the second quarter. That charge, along with $\n12\nmillion of external legal fees, is reflected within Settlement and related costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The payment terms under the Settlement consist of\n8\nquarterly payments of $\n45\nmillion that began in the second quarter. The portion payable in the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities, with the remaining amounts included within Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Item 3,\nLegal Proceedings\nfor additional information.\n64\nNote 15\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues share-based compensation awards under the Zebra Technologies 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”), approved by shareholders in 2018 which superseded and replaced all prior share-based incentive plans. Outstanding awards issued prior to the 2018 Plan are governed by the provisions of those plans until such awards have been exercised, forfeited, cancelled, expired or otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms. Awards available under the 2018 Plan include stock-settled awards, including stock-settled restricted stock units, stock-settled performance stock units, restricted stock awards, performance share awards, stock appreciation rights, incentive stock options, and non-qualified stock options.\nAwards available under the 2018 Plan also include cash-settled awards, including cash-settled stock appreciation rights, cash-settled restricted stock units, and cash-settled performance stock units.\nNo\nawards remain available for future grants under previous plans.\nThe Company uses treasury shares as its source for issuing shares under the share-based compensation programs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had\n2,791,708\nshares of Class A Common stock remaining available to be issued under the 2018 Plan.\nThe compensation expense from the Company’s share-based compensation plans and associated income tax benefit, excluding the effects of excess tax benefits or shortfalls, were included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022, total unearned compensation costs related to the Company’s share-based compensation plans was $\n111\nmillion, which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining service period of approximately\n1.4\nyears.\nThe majority of the Company’s share-based compensation awards are generally issued as part of its employee and non-employee director incentive program during the second quarter of each fiscal year.  The Company also issues awards associated with business acquisitions or other off-cycle events.\nStock-Settled Restricted Stock Units (“stock-settled RSUs”) and Stock-Settled Performance Share Units (“stock-settled PSUs”)\nThe Company began issuing stock-settled RSUs and stock-settled PSUs in the second quarter of 2021. Stock-settled RSUs and stock-settled PSUs each typically vest over a\nthree-year\nservice period, with stock-settled RSUs vesting ratably in\nthree\nannual installments and stock-settled PSUs vesting at the end of the\nthree-year\nperiod. Vesting for each participant is subject to restrictions, such as continuous employment, except in certain cases as set forth in each stock agreement. Upon vesting, stock-settled RSUs and stock-settled PSUs are converted into shares of Class A Common Stock that are released to participants.\nCompensation cost for the Company’s stock-settled RSUs and stock-settled PSUs is expensed over each participant’s required service period. Compensation cost is calculated as the fair market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of units granted, net of estimated forfeitures.  The fair value of PSUs also includes assumptions around achievement of certain Company-wide financial performance goals.\nRestricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and Performance Share Awards (“PSAs”)\nPrior to 2021, the Company’s restricted stock grants consisted of time-vested RSAs and PSAs as part of the Company’s annual incentive program.  These awards are considered participating securities, and as such, are included as part of the Company’s Class A Common Stock outstanding. The RSAs and PSAs vest at each vesting date, subject to restrictions such as continuous employment, except in certain cases as set forth in each stock agreement. Upon vesting, RSAs and PSAs are released to holders and are no longer subject to restrictions.\n65\nCompensation cost for the Company’s RSAs and PSAs is expensed over each participant’s required service period. Compensation cost is calculated as the fair market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of awards granted, net of estimated forfeitures.  The fair value of PSAs also includes assumptions around achievement of certain Company-wide financial performance goals.  The total required service period is typically\nthree years\n.\nThe Company also issues RSAs to non-employee directors. The number of shares granted to each non-employee director is determined by dividing the value of the annual grant by the price of a share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. New directors in any fiscal year earn a prorated amount. During fiscal 2022, there were\n5,686\nshares granted to non-employee directors compared to\n2,877\nand\n6,314\nduring fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The shares vest immediately upon grant.\nA summary of the Company’s restricted and performance stock-settled awards for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nStock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”)\n66\nSARs were previously granted primarily as part of the Company’s annual share-based compensation incentive program.  Beginning in 2021, the Company no longer included SARs in its annual share based compensation award issuances and did\nno\nt issue any SARs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The total fair value of SARs granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $\n6\nmillion, which was estimated on the respective dates of grant using a binomial model.\nA summary of the Company’s SARs is as follows:\nThe following table summarizes information about SARs outstanding as of December 31, 2022:\nThe intrinsic value of SARs exercised during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n8\nmillion, $\n69\nmillion and $\n60\nmillion, respectively. The total fair value of SARs that vested during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n3\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion, respectively.\nReflexis Replacement Options\nIn connection with the Company’s acquisition of Reflexis in 2020, the Company assumed the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Reflexis Systems, Inc. (the “Reflexis Plan”) and replaced certain unvested options under the Reflexis Plan with Zebra incentive stock options (“Reflexis Replacement Options”). Upon exercise of Reflexis Replacement Options, the Company receives cash proceeds equal to the exercise price and issues whole shares of Class A Common Stock to participants.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were\n17,457\noutstanding Reflexis Replacement Options, of which\n16,148\nwere exercisable. The outstanding awards have a weighted average exercise price and remaining contractual life of $\n58.20\nand\n5.4\nyears, respectively. The awards that are exercisable have a weighted average exercise price and remaining contractual life of $\n56.69\nand\n5.3\nyears, respectively. The intrinsic value of Reflexis Replacement Options exercised during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n2\nmillion, $\n4\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively. The total fair value of Reflexis Replacement Options that vested during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n1\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion, respectively.\nCash-settled awards\nThe Company also issues cash-settled share-based compensation awards, including cash-settled stock appreciation rights, cash-settled restricted stock units and cash-settled performance stock units that are classified as liability awards. These awards are expensed over the vesting period of the related award, which is typically\nthree years\n. Compensation cost is calculated at the fair value on grant date multiplied by the number of share-equivalents granted. The fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the Company’s stock price, with remeasurements reflected as an adjustment to compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash settlement is based on the fair value of share equivalents at the time of vesting, which was $\n5\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Share-equivalents issued under these programs totaled\n66,923\n,\n11,644\nand\n40,166\nin fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Zebra Technologies Corporation 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2020 ESPP”), which superseded the 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2011 ESPP”) and became effective on July 1,\n67\n2020. Like the 2011 ESPP, the 2020 ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at\n95\n% of the fair market value at the date of purchase. Employees may make purchases by cash or payroll deductions up to certain limits. The aggregate number of shares that may be purchased under the 2020 ESPP is\n1,500,000\nshares. As of December 31, 2022,\n1,399,851\nshares remained available for future purchase.\nNote 16\nIncome Taxes\nThe geographical sources of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows (in millions):\nIncome tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following (in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rates were\n14.9\n%,\n13.5\n% and\n10.0\n% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our actual income tax rate is provided below:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the generation of tax credits and the favorable impacts of foreign\n68\nearnings subject to U.S. taxation. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the generation of tax credits and the favorable impacts of share-based compensation benefits.\nThe Company evaluated the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, signed into law on August 16, 2022; the American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law on March 11, 2021; the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020; and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020. The provisions of these laws did not have a significant impact to our effective tax rate in either the current or prior years. Management continues to monitor guidance regarding these laws and developments related to other coronavirus tax relief throughout the world for potential impacts.\nIn December of 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) released Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax rules, which contemplate a minimum tax rate of 15%. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules and the framework calls for law enactment by OECD members to take effect in 2024. The Company will continue to monitor developments but believes the impact to future effective tax rates and corporate tax liability will be minimal.\nThe Company earns a significant amount of its operating income outside of the U.S that is taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The Company’s principal foreign jurisdictions that provide sources of operating income are the U.K. and Singapore. The Company has received an incentivized tax rate from the Singapore Economic Development Board, which reduces the income tax rate in that jurisdiction effective for calendar years 2019 to 2023. The Company has committed to making additional investments in Singapore over the period 2019 to 2023. However, should the Company not make these investments in accordance with the agreement, any incentive benefit would have to be repaid to the Singapore tax authorities.\nTax effects of temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nFor tax years beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposed a requirement that all R&D expenses be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes. The effect of this new provision is an increase of approximately $\n130\nmillion to deferred tax assets with a corresponding increase to the current tax liability.\n69\nThe Company’s valuation allowance primarily relates to Luxembourg reorganization activities in 2019, which had resulted in the realization of deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in valuation allowances related to depreciation and amortization. The Company’s valuation allowance also consists of certain net operating loss (“NOL”) and credit carryforwards for which the Company believes it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. With respect to all other deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize a tax benefit. There were no significant adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $\n432\nmillion (tax effected) of “NOLs” and $\n32\nmillion of credit carryforwards. Approximately $\n183\nmillion of NOLs will expire beginning in 2023 through 2040, and $\n25\nmillion of credits will expire beginning in 2023 through 2037, with the remaining amounts of NOLs and credit carryforwards having no expiration dates.\nThe Company is subject to the GILTI, BEAT and FDII provisions, for which we recorded an income tax benefit of $\n19\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and an income tax expense of $\n8\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020. These impacts are included in the calculation of the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe Company is not permanently reinvested with respect to its U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiaries. The Company is subject to U.S. income tax on substantially all foreign earnings under GILTI, while any remaining foreign earnings are eligible for a dividends received deduction. As a result, future repatriation of earnings will not be subject to additional U.S. federal income tax but may be subject to currency translation gains or losses. Where required, the Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes on current earnings. Additionally, gains and losses on any future taxable dispositions of U.S.-owned foreign affiliates continue to be subject to U.S. income tax.\nThe Company has not recognized deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. with respect to its outside basis differences in its directly-owned foreign affiliates. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were $\n7\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. Additionally, fiscal years 2009 through 2022 remain open to examination by multiple foreign and U.S. state taxing jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, no significant uncertain tax positions are expected to be settled within the next twelve months. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit or litigation outcome, the Company’s estimates of the ultimate settlements of uncertain tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from estimates.\nThe Company recognized less than $\n1\nmillion of net tax benefit associated with interest and penalties related to income tax matters during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company recognized\nno\nnet tax benefit and a tax benefit of $\n2\nmillion for interest and penalties during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The expense or benefit associated with interest and penalties was reflected within Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has included $\n5\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion of estimated interest and penalty obligations within Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets each as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n70\nNote 17\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted common shares outstanding is computed using the Treasury Stock method and, in periods of income, reflects the additional shares that would be outstanding if dilutive share-based compensation awards were converted into common shares during the period.\nEarnings per share (in millions, except share data):\nAnti-dilutive share-based compensation awards are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations. There were\n173,519\n,\n8,000\n, and\n46,128\nshares that were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nNote 18\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nStockholders’ equity includes certain items classified as AOCI, including:\n•\nUnrealized gain (loss) on anticipated sales hedging transactions\nrelates to derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure related to currency exchange rates for forecasted Euro sales. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and the Company defers income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transaction occurs See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor more details.\n•\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nrelate to the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company is required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to U.S. Dollars using a combination of historical, period end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI.\n71\nThe changes in each component of AOCI during the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n(1) See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nregarding timing of reclassifications to operating results.\nNote 19\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company has Receivables Factoring arrangements, pursuant to which certain receivables are sold to banks without recourse in exchange for cash. Transactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangements are accounted for as sales under ASC 860,\nTransfers and Servicing of Financial Assets\n, with the sold receivables removed from the Company’s balance sheet. Under these Receivables Factoring arrangements, the Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The banks’ purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe Company currently has\ntwo\nactive Receivables Factoring arrangements. One arrangement allows for the factoring of up to $\n25\nmillion of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA region. The second arrangement allows for the factoring of up to €\n150\nmillion of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. With respect to the second arrangement, the Company may be required to maintain a portion of sales proceeds as deposits in a restricted cash account that is released to the Company as it satisfies its obligations as servicer of sold receivables, which totaled $\n12\nmillion each as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is classified within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company received cash proceeds of $\n1,496\nmillion, $\n1,504\nmillion and $\n1,291\nmillion, respectively, from the sales of accounts receivables under its factoring arrangements. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were a total of $\n61\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $\n130\nmillion and $\n141\nmillion of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n72\nFees incurred in connection with these arrangements were not significant.\nNote 20\nSegment Information & Geographic Data\nSegment results\nThe Company’s operations consist of\ntwo\nreportable segments: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”). The reportable segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker or “CODM”) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company’s segments. The CODM reviews adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs (such as the Settlement in the current year). Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s CODM and therefore are not disclosed below.\nEffective January 1, 2022, the location solutions offering, which provides a range of RTLS and services that generate on-demand information about the physical location and status of assets, equipment, and people, moved from our AIT segment into our EVM segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business. We have reported our results reflecting this change, including historical periods, on a comparable basis. This change did not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial information by segment is presented as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nTo the extent applicable, amounts included in Corporate eliminations consist of business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs (such as the Settlement in the current year).\n(2)\nAIT and EVM segment operating income includes depreciation and share-based compensation expense. The amounts of depreciation and share-based compensation expense are proportionate to each segment’s Net sales.\n73\nSales to significant customers\nThe Company has three customers, who are distributors of the Company’s products and solutions, that individually accounted for more than 10% of total Company Net sales during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe approximate percentage of our segment and Company total Net sales to these customers were as follows:\nThese customers accounted for\n21.7\n%,\n19.5\n%, and\n17.8\n%, respectively, of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022, and\n22.7\n%,\n13.4\n% and\n14.8\n%, respectively, of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total Net sales during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020, or more than 10% of outstanding accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.\nGeographic data\nInformation regarding the Company’s operations by geographic area is contained in the following tables. Net sales amounts are attributed to geographic area based on customer location.\nNet sales by region were as follows (in millions):\nThe U.S. and Germany were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nNet sales during these years were as follows (in millions):\nGeographic data for long-lived assets is as follows (in millions):\nLong-lived assets are defined by the Company as property, plant and equipment and ROU assets.

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our Disclosure Committee, and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in this Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or furnish under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as released in 2013. Based on this assessment and those criteria, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nOur assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls over the operati\nons of Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., w\nhich are included in our 2022 consolidated financial statements and constituted 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2022, and 1% of revenues for the year then ended.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on Zebra’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report is included in the latter portion of this Item 9A.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Zebra have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n75\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Zebra Technologies Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Zebra Technologies Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls over the operations of Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2022, and 1% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Zebra Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes, and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 16, 2023\n76"
