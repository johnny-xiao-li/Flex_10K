Driven by iconic consumer brands, our portfolio includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, Paramount+ and Pluto TV. We hold one of the industry’s most extensive libraries of television and film titles. In addition to offering innovative streaming services and digital video products, we also provide powerful capabilities in production, distribution and advertising solutions.\nOur strategy is grounded in three key strengths: (1) our broad range of popular content; (2) our multiplatform distribution model; and (3) our global operating reach. In 2022, we demonstrated the continued breadth and depth of our content capabilities across our distribution platforms — broadcast, including the leading network in the United States (the “U.S.”), CBS; a portfolio of cable networks that includes Nickelodeon, MTV and BET; a rapidly growing subscription streaming service, Paramount+; a leading free advertising-supported streaming television (“FAST”) service in the U.S., Pluto TV; and an iconic Hollywood studio, Paramount Pictures. Our global operating footprint includes content production capabilities across Latin America, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, cable networks in many key markets and deep commercial relationships with strategic partners around the world.\n2022 was a notable year for us in streaming. Benefiting from a slate of original series, including\nHalo\n,\n1883\n,\n1923\n,\nTulsa King\n,\nCriminal Minds: Evolution\nand\nSEAL Team\n, and original films, including\nOrphan: First Kill\nand\nBeavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe\n, our global streaming subscribers grew 38% year-over-year to 77.3 million and Paramount+ subscribers grew 70% year-over-year to 55.9 million. According to Antenna, Paramount+ is the number one premium streaming service in domestic sign-ups and gross subscriber additions since its launch in March 2021 through the end of 2022, and had the most sign-ups in 2022. In sports, we reached a six-year multiplatform U.S. media rights extension for the Union of European Football Associations (“UEFA”) Champions League. We also recently announced that we will be fully integrating SHOWTIME into Paramount+\nI-1\nacross both streaming and linear platforms later in 2023.

Through partnerships with several non-profit organizations, Operation Sea Change aims to help remove and divert ocean plastic by funding global clean-up work, promoting sustainable products, and educating fans on how they can help protect the ocean.\nRegulation\nOur businesses and the intellectual property they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (“E.U.”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change, as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, laws and regulations affecting our businesses.\nI-10\nFCC and Similar Regulation\nThe FCC regulates broadcast television, some aspects of cable network programming, and certain programming delivered by internet protocol in the U.S., pursuant to U.S. federal law, including the Communications Act. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, the imposition of reporting obligations, limited renewals of broadcast station licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license.\nLicense Renewals and Transfers\nEach of our owned television stations in the U.S. must be licensed by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for eight-year terms, and we must obtain renewals as they expire to continue operating our stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that (1) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (2) with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or FCC regulations; and (3) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending. In addition, the Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee.\nBroadcast Ownership Regulation\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules impose limits on local and national broadcast television station ownership in the U.S. The broadcast ownership rules discussed below are the most relevant to our U.S. operations.\nLocal Television Ownership\nThe FCC’s local television ownership rule generally prohibits common ownership of two full-power stations in a market unless at least one of the stations is not a top-four ranked station in the market based on audience share at the time of acquisition of the second station. However, the FCC may permit such common ownership if it finds such ownership would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.\nDual Network Rule\nThe dual network rule prohibits any of the four major U.S. broadcast networks — ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC — from combining or being under common control.\nTelevision National Audience Reach Limitation\nUnder the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of this rule, a UHF station is afforded a “discount” and is therefore attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. We currently own and operate television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households, but we are attributed with reaching approximately 24% of all such households for purposes of the national ownership rule because of the discount.\nForeign Ownership\nThe Communications Act generally restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of our voting power or equity. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. The FCC has approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, following its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.\nI-11\nCable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by cable system operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, and other MVPDs in the U.S. Pursuant to these regulations, we have elected to negotiate with MVPDs for the right to carry our broadcast television stations via retransmission consent agreements. The Communications Act and FCC regulations require that broadcasters and some categories of MVPDs negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Some MVPDs have sought changes to federal law that would eliminate or otherwise limit the ability of broadcasters to obtain fair compensation for the grant of retransmission consent.\nProgram Regulation\nThe FCC also regulates the content of broadcast, cable network, and other video programming. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is $479,945 per indecent or profane utterance or image, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $4.3 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The FCC also monitors compliance with requirements that apply to broadcasters and cable networks relating to political advertising, identification of program sponsors, and the use and integrity of the Emergency Alert System. In addition, FCC regulations require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming, as well as certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol. Broadcast television stations in certain markets that are affiliated with one of the four major U.S. broadcast networks must also provide a certain amount of programming every quarter that includes audio-narrated description of a program’s key visual elements that make the program accessible to blind and low-vision viewers.\nChildren’s Programming\nOur business is subject to various regulations in the U.S. and abroad applicable to children’s programming. U.S. federal law and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast television stations and cable networks during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and the FCC also limits the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. Moreover, each of our broadcast television stations in the U.S. is required to air, in general, three hours per week of programming specifically designed to meet the educational and informational programming needs of children 16 years of age and younger. In addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (“HFSS”) to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the U.K. since 2007. The U.K. government has announced its intention to impose a ban, effective in October 2025, on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. on television and a total ban online. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in a number of jurisdictions, and pressure for their introduction elsewhere continues to be felt globally.\nBroadcast Transmission Standard\nFCC rules permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0.” Full-service television stations using the standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. We are participating in ATSC 3.0 partnerships with other broadcasters and may enter into additional partnerships in the future.\nI-12\nInternational Free-to-Air Regulations\nOur international free-to-air networks are subject to the rules and regulations of a number of foreign regulators, including the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in Australia; the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the U.K.; Ente Nacional de Comunicaciones (ENACOM) in Argentina; and the Consejo Nacional de Televisión (CNTV) in Chile.\nGlobal Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws\nWe are subject to a number of data protection and privacy laws in many of the jurisdictions in which operate, including laws in a number of different U.S. states and the European Union. These laws impact, or may impact, the way we collect, process and transfer personal data. We are also subject to laws and regulations in many jurisdictions that are specifically intended to protect the interests of children, including the privacy of minors online. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection —\nWe are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection\n.”\nIntellectual Property\nWe are fundamentally a content company, and the trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws that protect our brands and content are extremely important to us. It is our practice to protect our brands, content and related intellectual property.\nNotwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy,\nthe infringement of our intellectual property rights presents a significant challenge to our industry\n.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Intellectual Property —\nInfringement of our content reduces revenue received from the distribution of our programming, films, books, interactive games and other entertainment content.\n”\nOur Executive Officers\nOur executive officers as of the date hereof are as follows:\nRobert M.

    "text": "A wide range of risks may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, now and in the future. We consider the risks described below to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable factors that could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nIf our streaming business is unsuccessful, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected\nStreaming is intensely competitive and cash intensive and there can be no assurance our streaming business will be profitable or otherwise successful. Our ability to continue to attract, engage and retain streaming subscribers and active users (together, “users”), as well as generate the corresponding subscription and advertising revenues, depends on a number of factors, including our ability to consistently provide appealing and differentiated content that resonates globally, effectively market our content and services, and provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing that content. Our success will require significant investments to produce original content and acquire the rights to third-party content, including sports, as well as the establishment and maintenance of key content and distribution partnerships. If we are unable to manage costs or maintain such partnerships, we may fail to meet our profitability goals.\nWe must continually add new users, including through expansion into new markets and converting promotional subscribers, while also meaningfully engaging existing users with new and exciting content to manage “churn” and maximize our advertising and subscription revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in attracting, engaging and retaining users, as well as creative talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. If consumers do not consider our streaming services to be of value compared to competing services, including because we fail to introduce compelling new content and features, do not maintain competitive pricing, terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is unfavorably received, or because they experience technical issues or do not think that they use our streaming services sufficiently, we may not be able to attract, engage and retain users, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur advertising revenues have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in consumer viewership, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a decline in advertising revenues could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe evolution of consumer preferences toward streaming and other digital services and the increasing number of entertainment choices has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced content viewership through traditional linear distribution models, which has caused and may continue to cause ratings and viewer declines for our television networks. This evolution has also given rise to new ways of purchasing advertising, as well as a general shift in total advertising expenditures toward streaming and digital, some of which may not be as beneficial to us as traditional advertising methods. In addition, a number of other streaming services have introduced advertising-supported tiers, which creates competition for advertising expenditures for our own advertising-supported streaming services. There can be no assurance that we can successfully navigate the evolving streaming and digital advertising market or that the advertising revenues we generate in that market will replace the declines in advertising revenues generated from our traditional linear business.\nThe strength of the advertising market can fluctuate, reflecting factors that include general macroeconomic conditions as well as the economic prospects and spending priorities of specific advertisers or industries. Natural and other disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could also lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services,\nI-15\nuninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for our content, the consumers in our targeted demographics, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers.\nMajor sports events, such as the Super Bowl and the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament and state, congressional and presidential elections cycles may cause our advertising revenues to vary substantially from year to year. Political advertising expenditures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and political action campaigns to raise and spend funds on advertising and the competitive nature of the elections affecting viewers in markets featuring our content.\nAdvertising sales are also largely dependent on audience measurement and could be negatively affected if measurement methodologies do not accurately reflect viewership levels. Nielsen’s statistical sampling method is the primary measurement technique used in our television advertising sales; however, it does not fully measure viewership across streaming and digital. We measure and monetize across our streaming services using census-based advertising-server data establishing the number of impressions served, combined with third-party data providing demographic composition estimates. Multiplatform campaign verification remains in its infancy and is still not measured by any one consistently applied method. While we expect innovation and standards around multiplatform measurement to benefit us as the advertising market continues to evolve, we are nevertheless partially dependent on third parties to deliver those solutions. Our ability to target and measure audiences is also limited by an increasing number of global laws and regulations.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries\nWe face substantial and increasing competition to attract creative talent, produce and acquire the rights to high-quality content, and for distribution on a variety of third-party platforms. Competition for talent, content, audiences, subscribers, service providers, production infrastructure, advertising and distribution is intense and comes from other television networks and stations, streaming services (including those that provide pirated content), social media, film studios and independent film producers and distributors, consumer products companies and other entertainment outlets and platforms, as well as from “second screen” applications. We also compete with additional entrants into the market for the production of original content.\nThese competitive pressures have increased, and may continue to increase. Accordingly, the prices we pay for talent and intellectual property rights have resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant cost increases. We invest significant resources to produce, market and distribute original content. We also acquire content and ancillary rights and pay related rights fees, license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation. We license various music rights from major record companies, music publishers and performing rights organizations. If these competitive pressures continue to increase, we may not be able to produce or acquire content in a cost-effective manner. We may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new, popular content or in connection with the renewals of popular rights we currently hold. Accordingly, there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated returns on our investments.\nConsolidation among our competitors and other market participants has increased, and may continue to increase, also resulting in increased competitive pressures. Our competitors include companies with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, as well as companies in adjacent sectors with significant financial, marketing and other resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing. Such competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, such as artificial intelligence, customer data or other competitive information. Our competitors may also enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nThis competition could result in a decrease in users, lower ratings and advertising revenues, lower affiliate and other revenues, and increased content costs and promotional and other expenses, negatively affecting our ability to generate revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nI-16\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain attractive brands and to offer popular content\nOur ability to maintain attractive brands and to create, distribute and/or license popular content are key to our success and ability to generate revenues. The revenues we generate primarily depend on our ability to consistently anticipate and satisfy consumer tastes and expectations, both in the U.S. and internationally. Consumer tastes and behavior change frequently, and it is a challenge to anticipate what will be successful at any point in time. The popularity of our original content and the content we acquire from third parties is affected by our ability to develop and maintain strong reputation and brand awareness; our ability to target key audiences; the quality and attractiveness of competing content; and the availability and popularity of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities. A shortfall in the expected popularity of content we distribute, including sports for which we have acquired rights, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models, may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to shifting content consumption patterns. The ways in which viewers consume content, and technology and business models in our industry, continue to evolve, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenues. Technological advancements have empowered consumers to seek more control over how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching target audiences. This trend has impacted certain traditional distribution models, as demonstrated by industrywide declines in broadcast and cable ratings, declines in cable subscribers, the development of alternative distribution platforms for broadcast and cable programming and reduced theatergoing. Declines in linear viewership are expected to continue and possibly accelerate, which could adversely affect our advertising and affiliate revenues. To respond to these developments, we regularly adopt or develop new technologies and consider, and from time to time implement, changes to our business models and strategies to remain competitive, such as our increased investment in streaming. There can be no assurance that we will successfully anticipate or respond to these developments, that we will not experience disruption, even as we respond to such developments, or that the new technologies or business models we develop will be as successful or as profitable as historic or existing ones.\nThe loss of affiliation and distribution agreements, renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms or adverse interpretations thereof could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nA significant portion of our revenues are attributable to agreements with a limited number of distributors. These agreements generally have fixed terms that vary by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that they will be renewed in the future, or renewed on favorable terms, including those related to pricing and programming tiers. The loss of existing packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities and the loss of carriage or the failure to renew our agreements with any distributor, or renew them on favorable terms, could reduce the distribution of our programming and program services and decrease the potential audience for our programs, thereby negatively affecting our growth prospects and revenues from both affiliate fees and advertising. The CBS Network provides affiliated television stations regularly scheduled programming in return for the insertion of network commercials during that programming and the payment of reverse compensation. The loss of such station affiliation agreements could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our programming and therefore our attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations.\nConsolidation among and vertical integration of distributors in the cable or broadcast network business has provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or obtain distribution for our network programming or distribution and/or marketing of our subscription services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Also, consolidation among television station group owners\nI-17\ncould increase their negotiating leverage. Competitive pressures faced by MVPDs, particularly in light of evolving consumer consumption patterns and new distribution models, could adversely affect the terms of our renewals with MVPDs. In addition, MVPDs continue to develop alternative offerings for consumers. To the extent these offerings do not include our content and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional offerings, we could experience a decline in affiliate revenues.\nOur revenues are dependent on the compliance of major distributors with the terms of our affiliation or distribution agreements. As these agreements have grown in complexity, the number of disputes regarding their interpretation and even their validity has grown, resulting in greater uncertainty and, from time to time, litigation with respect to our rights and obligations. Some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” (“MFN”) clauses, which provide that if we enter into an agreement with a distributor and such agreement includes terms that are more favorable than those held by a distributor holding an MFN right, we must offer some of those terms to the distributor holding the MFN right. Disagreements with a distributor on the interpretation or validity of an agreement could adversely impact our affiliate and advertising revenues, as well as our relationship with that distributor.\nDamage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact us across businesses and regions\nOur reputation and globally recognized brands are critical to our success. Our reputation depends on a number of factors, including the quality of our offerings, the level of trust we maintain with our customers and our ability to successfully innovate. Because our brands engage consumers across our businesses, damage to our reputation or brands in one business may have an impact on our others and, because some of our brands are recognized around the world, brand damage may not be locally contained. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding Paramount or its operations, content, products, management, employees, practices, business partners, business decisions, social responsibility and culture, including individuals associated with the content we create and/or license, as well as our inability to adequately prepare for or respond to such negative claims or publicity, may damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could impact our sales, number of viewers and users, business opportunities, profitability, retention, recruiting and the trading price of our securities.\nOur ongoing investments in new businesses, products, services, technologies and other strategic activities present many risks, and we may not realize intended financial and strategic goals\nWe have invested in, and may continue to invest in, new businesses, products, services, technologies and other strategic initiatives, including through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and investments, restructurings and transformation initiatives. These investments may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: difficulty integrating acquired businesses; failure to realize anticipated benefits; unanticipated problems, expenses and liabilities; potential disruption to our business and operations; diversion of management’s attention; difficulty managing expanded operations; the loss or inability to retain key employees\nand creative talent; unanticipated challenges to or loss of our relationship with new or existing customers, viewers, advertisers, suppliers, distributors, licensors;\ninsufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with new investments; and failure to successfully develop an acquired business or technology. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and because new investments are inherently risky, and the anticipated benefits or value of these investments may not materialize, there can be no assurance that such investments and other strategic initiatives will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and programming\nCertain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in advertising markets, a decrease in audience acceptance of our content, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in a downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, intangible assets, including FCC licenses, and/or programming assets,\nI-18\nwhich could result in a noncash impairment charge. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on our reported net earnings.\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business\nWe are committed to advancing and strengthening our approach to addressing ESG-related matters and we have announced a number of ESG initiatives and goals, but such initiatives, and our response to new ESG-related laws and regulations, will require additional investments, as well as the attention of our management team in connection with implementation and oversight of new practices and reporting processes, which will impose additional compliance risk. Our ability to implement these new initiatives and requirements and achieve the targets we may be expected to reach will be dependent on a number of factors, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our goals or that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcomes. In addition, consumers’ perceptions of our initiatives, the goals that we set and our efforts to achieve them may present risks to our reputation and brands. If we are unable to meet the ESG goals we set or if our goals are not aligned with expectations of our stakeholders, we may lose employees and creative talent, and have difficulty recruiting or attracting new employees, talent, partners or investors, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection\nDisruptions or failures of, or cybersecurity attacks on, our or our service providers’ networks, information systems and other technologies could result in the disclosure of confidential or valuable business or personal information, disruption of our businesses, damage to our brands and reputation, and legal exposure and financial losses; and our business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address any such disruption, failure or attack\nCloud services, networks, software, information systems and other technologies we use or that are used by our third-party service providers and our product suppliers (“Providers”), including technology systems used by us and our Providers in connection with the production and distribution of our content (including content delivery networks to stream programming, films and other content in high volume to viewers and users of our online, mobile and app offerings over the internet) and that otherwise perform important functions (“Systems”), are critical to our business activities. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks on our or our Providers’ Systems pose increasing risks to our business and may be caused by third-party hacking; dissemination of computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software; denial-of-service attacks and other bad acts; human error; and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks could have an adverse impact on us, our business partners, advertisers and other Providers, employees, viewers and users of our content, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. Steps we or our Providers take to enhance, improve or upgrade Systems may not be sufficient to avoid shutdowns, disruptions and attacks. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations and reduction of our revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate our businesses, viewer or advertiser dissatisfaction or a loss of viewers or advertisers, and damage to our reputation or brands. In addition, our recovery and business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address any such disruption, failure or cybersecurity attack.\nWe are subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or programming content maintained in our or our Providers’ Systems, including proprietary and personal information (of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings), business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our or our Providers’ Systems, or fraudulently induce employees, business partners or users of our online, mobile and app offerings to disclose sensitive or confidential information, in order to gain access to our own proprietary data or the data of our subscribers’ or users’, our programming or our intellectual property. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful phishing, information security breaches or disruptive ransomware or denial-of-service attacks have increased significantly in recent years, and because of our\nI-19\nprominence, we and/or Providers we use may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, networks and Systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate security measures or remediate flaws or detect intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these adverse events occurring cannot be eliminated.\nIf a material breach of our Systems or those of our Providers occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose subscribers, viewers, revenues, advertisers and other business partners, and users of our online, mobile and app offerings; our reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged; and we could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair, replace or recover such Systems. We could also be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events.\nWe are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection\nWe are subject to laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use, transfer, storage and security of personal data. In the E.U., for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance, requiring extensive compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities. In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) mandates a host of new obligations for businesses regarding how they handle the personal information of California residents. There are also several new state laws in the U.S. that will go into effect in 2023, including the new California Privacy Right Act that will amend the CCPA in early 2023, as well as comprehensive privacy laws in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, all of which will expand the consumer rights provided under the CCPA to other states and create even more onerous obligations, including a requirement to implement mechanisms to allow consumers to opt out of personal data sharing with third parties in the context of digital advertising. In addition, beginning in 2023, California will also offer equivalent privacy rights in the employment and business-to-business context, similar to what already exists under GDPR in the E.U. We are also subject to laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children and the online safety and privacy of minors, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the U.S., the GDPR in the E.U., and codes of conduct and rules relating to the design of digital products and services likely to be accessed by children including the U.K.’s Age Appropriate Design Code and the California Age Appropriate Design Code Act, which goes into effect in 2024. As a result, we have been required to limit some functionality on digital properties and may be limited relative to our abilities to leverage new media with respect to children’s programming or services. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these digital properties and how we perform measurement for advertising purposes and impose strict liability on us for certain of our actions, as well as certain actions of our advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. Compliance with privacy and data protection rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations, which may be inconsistent with one another, and noncompliance could result in regulatory investigations and enforcement, significant monetary fines, breaches of contractual obligations and private litigation. Any actual or perceived noncompliance could also lead to harm to our reputation and market position. See “Business — Regulation —\nGlobal Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws\n.”\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nInfringement of our content reduces revenue received from the distribution of our programming, films, books, interactive games and other entertainment content\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights. We are fundamentally a content company and infringement of our content — specifically, the infringement of our films,\nI-20\ntelevision programming, digital content, books, interactive games and other intellectual property rights — adversely affects the value of our content. Copyright infringement is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack effective laws and technical protection measures similar to those existing in the U.S. and Europe or lack effective enforcement of such measures, or both. Such foreign copyright infringement can also create a supply of pirated content for major markets. The interpretation of copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws as applied to our content, and our infringement-detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux, and some methods of enforcement have encountered political or commercial opposition. The failure to appropriately enforce and/or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect and monetize our intellectual property and thus negatively affect its value.\nCopyright infringement is made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine encryption and other security features and enable infringers to disguise their identities online. We and our production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content. The continuing proliferation of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. Internet-connected televisions, set-top boxes and mobile devices are ubiquitous, and many can support illegal retransmission platforms, illicit video-on-demand or streaming services and pre-loaded hardware, providing more accessible, versatile and legitimate-looking environments for consuming unlicensed film and television content. Unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of films, television programs or other content as well as a reduction in demand for authorized content, which would likely have significant adverse effects on the value of the affected content and our ability to monetize it.\nCopyright infringement reduces the revenue that we are able to generate from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels, reduces the public’s and some affiliate partners’ perceived value of our content and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, and it is likely that we will continue to expend substantial resources in connection with these initiatives. Efforts to prevent the unauthorized reproduction, distribution and exhibition of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business.\nRisks Relating to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions\nEconomic and political conditions in a variety of markets around the world could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur businesses operate and have audiences, customers and partners worldwide, and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets, some of which are emerging markets. Accordingly, the economic conditions in many different markets around the world affect a number of aspects of our businesses. The global financial markets have experienced significant recent volatility, marked by declining economic growth, diminished liquidity and availability of credit, declines in consumer confidence, significant concerns for increasing and persistently high inflation and uncertainty about economic stability. The global financial markets have also been adversely affected by current geopolitical events, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions imposed against Russia in response to the invasion may also adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Volatility and weakness in the capital markets, the tightening of credit markets or a decrease in our debt ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. Increasing inflation in the U.S. raises our costs for labor and services and other costs required to operate our business.\nEconomic conditions in each market (such as current high inflation or global supply chain issues) can also impact our audience’s discretionary spending and therefore their willingness to access our content, as well as the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks, causing them to reduce their spending on advertising. We may also be subject to longer payment cycles. In addition, as we have expanded our international\nI-21\noperations, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar has increased, and there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain stable in any period. We may also be impacted by broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution.\nOur businesses are also exposed to certain political risks inherent in conducting a global business, including retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in the U.S. and other countries, including in connection with trade negotiations; issues related to the presence of corruption in certain markets and enforcement of anticorruption laws and regulations; increased risk of political instability in some markets as well as conflict and sanctions preventing us from accessing those markets; escalating trade, immigration and nuclear disputes; wars, acts of terrorism or other hostilities (such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine); and other political, economic or other uncertainties.\nThese political and economic risks could create instability in any of the markets where our businesses derive revenues, which could result in a reduction of revenue or loss of investment that adversely affects our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nCOVID-19 and other pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the global macroeconomic environment. COVID-19 and the governmental measures to control its spread such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, social distancing measures, restrictions on large gatherings of people and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders have contributed to a\ndifficult macroeconomic environment, including a decline in consumer confidence, global supply chain issues and inflation, prolonged declines in economic growth, and changes in consumer behavior.\nOther pandemics or widespread health emergencies may have similar effects.\nAs a result of COVID-19, our advertising revenues were negatively impacted due to weakness in the advertising market, the cancellation or postponement of sporting events, and the delay of the broadcast television season as a result of production shutdowns. COVID-19 also had a negative effect on our licensing revenues due to production shutdowns, delays in our delivery of content to third parties, and fewer original programs and live events airing on our networks. Our theatrical revenues were negatively impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters, and we experienced lower demand for the licensing of our content from advertising-supported licensees.\nThe magnitude of the continuing impact of COVID-19 and new and emerging variants, which could be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not be able to accurately predict or control, including the duration and extent of the pandemic; the extent, duration and impact of governmental measures; consumer behavior in response to the pandemic and such measures; and economic and operating conditions in the aftermath of COVID-19. A resurgence of COVID-19, an increase in infection rates or the effect of new variants could trigger a renewal of government restrictions and other precautionary actions that could again negatively impact our businesses as described above. Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of new variants, we are not able to estimate the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and that impact could also exacerbate the other risks described herein.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nFailures to comply with or changes in U\n.\nS\n.\nor foreign laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and/or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our partners operate, including laws and regulations relating to intellectual property, content regulation, privacy, data protection, anticorruption, repatriation of profits, tax regimes, quotas, tariffs or other trade barriers,\nI-22\ncurrency exchange controls, operating license and permit requirements, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, anticompetitive conduct, export and market access restrictions.\nThe broadcast and cable industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. For example, we are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our television stations and periodically renew them. It cannot be assured that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The nonrenewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. We must also comply with extensive FCC limits on the ownership and operation of our television stations and the CBS Television Network, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some television stations.\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws by courts and regulators and the threat that additional laws or regulations may be forthcoming, as well as our ability to enforce our legal rights. We could be required to change or limit certain of our business practices, which could impact our ability to generate revenues. We could also incur substantial costs to comply with new and existing laws and regulations, or face substantial fines and penalties or other liabilities, or be subjected to increased scrutiny from regulators and stakeholders, if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nOur liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely impact our financial conditions\nWe have both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to our existing business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. We cannot be assured that our accruals for these matters are sufficient to cover these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, if and/or when they become due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating performance or cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Human Capital\nThe loss of existing or inability to hire new key employees or secure creative talent could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur business depends on the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executives and other employees and the creative talent with whom we work. We compete for executives in highly specialized and evolving industries and our ability to attract, retain and engage such individuals may be impacted by our reputation, workplace culture, the training, development, compensation and benefits we provide, our commitment to effectively managing executive succession, and our efforts with respect to DEI and ESG matters. We also employ or contract with entertainment personalities with loyal audiences and produce films and other content with highly regarded directors, producers, writers, actors and other creative talent in highly competitive markets. These individuals are important to attracting viewers and the success of our programs, films and other content, and our ability to attract and retain them may similarly be impacted by our reputation, culture and DEI and ESG efforts. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining them or new talent will be reasonable. If we fail to retain or attract new key employees or creative talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we and our business partners engage the services of writers, directors, actors, musicians and other creative talent, production crew members, trade employees, professional athletes and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Any labor disputes, including lockouts, strikes or work stoppages, may disrupt\nI-23\nour operations and cause delays in the production of our programming, which could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and/or operating income.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility in the price of our Common Stock\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility in the price of our Common Stock. Various factors have impacted, and may continue to impact, the price of our Common Stock, including variations in our operating results; changes in our estimates, guidance or business plans; variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts, and changes in recommendations by securities analysts; market sentiment about our business, including the viability of our streaming business and views related to its profitability; the activities, operating results or stock price of our competitors or other industry participants in the industries in which we operate; changes in management; the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor; events affecting the stock market generally; and the broader macroeconomic and political environment in the U.S. and internationally, as well as other factors and risks described in this section. Some of these factors may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nNAI, through its voting control of the Company, is in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval\nNAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of our Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 77.4% of our voting Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 9.8% of our Common Stock.\nNAI is controlled by the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Part B General Trust (the “General Trust”), which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI and acts by majority vote of seven voting trustees (subject to certain exceptions), including with respect\nto\nthe NAI shares held by the General Trust. Shari E. Redstone, Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI and non-executive\nChair of our Board of Directors\n, is one of the seven voting trustees for the General Trust and is one of two voting trustees who are beneficiaries of the General Trust. No member of our management or other member of our Board of Directors is a trustee of the General Trust.\nNAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending our bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, our bylaws provide that:\n•\nthe affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for our stockholders to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any of our bylaws;\n•\nany or all of our directors may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of his or her term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of our Common Stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of our stockholders called expressly for that purpose; and\n•\nin accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.\nAccordingly, our stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control.\nI-24\nSales of NAI’s shares of our Common Stock, some of which are pledged to lenders, could adversely affect the stock price\nBased on information received from NAI, NAI has pledged to its lenders a portion of shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate number of shares pledged by NAI to its lenders represented approximately 4.5% of the total outstanding shares of our Common Stock. If there is a default on NAI’s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares, the lenders may not effect a transfer, sale or disposition of any pledged shares of our Class A Common Stock unless NAI and its affiliates beneficially own 50% or less of our Class A Common Stock then outstanding or such shares have first been converted into our Class B Common Stock. A sale of the pledged shares could adversely affect our Common Stock share price. In addition, there can be no assurance that at some future time NAI will not sell or pledge additional shares of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect our Common Stock share price."

During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we declared total per share dividends of $.96, resulting in total annual dividends of $635 million, $625 million and $601 million, respectively.\nDuring each of the quarters of 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.4375 per share on our 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”), resulting in total annual dividends of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded total annual dividends on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $44 million. During each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $1.4375 per share. During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $1.5493 per share, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021.\nWe currently expect to continue to pay regular cash dividends.\nAt December 31, 2022, the remaining authorization on our share repurchase program was $2.36 billion. Since the program was announced in November 2010, our Board of Directors has authorized, and we have announced a total of $17.9 billion for the repurchase of our common stock in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including accelerated stock repurchases or privately negotiated transactions). During the fourth quarter of 2022, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock.\nAs of February 13, 2023, there were 1,925 record holders of our Class A Common Stock and 26,747 record holders of our Class B Common Stock.\nII-1\nP\nerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return of our Class A and Class B Common Stock with the cumulative total return on the companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (“S&P 500”) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Media and Entertainment Industry Group Index (“S&P 500 Media and Entertainment Index”).\nThe performance graph assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2017 in each of our Class A and Class B Common Stock, the S&P 500, and the S&P 500 Media and Entertainment Index, including reinvestment of dividends, through the calendar year ended December 31, 2022.\nTotal Cumulative Stockholder Return\nFor Five-Year Period Ended December 31, 2022\nII-2\nEffective February 16, 2022, we changed our name from ViacomCBS Inc. to Paramount Global. Management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of Paramount Global should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. References in this document to “Paramount,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Paramount Global and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nSignificant components of management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition include:\n•\nOverview\n—Summary of our business and operational highlights.\n•\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n—Analysis of our results on a consolidated basis for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, including comparisons of 2022 to 2021 and 2021 to 2020.\n•\nSegment Results of Operations\n—Analysis of our results on a reportable segment basis for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022 including comparisons of 2022 to 2021 and 2021 to 2020.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n—Discussions of our cash flows, including sources and uses of cash, for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, and of our outstanding debt, commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2022.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies\n—Detail with respect to accounting policies that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements.\n•\nLegal Matters\n—Discussion of legal matters to which we are involved.\n•\nMarket Risk\n—Discussion of how we manage exposure to market and interest rate risks.\nII-3\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOverview\nOperational Highlights 2022 vs. 2021\n(a) Certain items identified as affecting comparability are excluded in non-GAAP results. See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n” for details of these items and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nFor 2022, revenues increased 5% to $30.15 billion, driven by significant growth in our streaming services, led by Paramount+, and higher theatrical revenues, reflecting the success of our 2022 releases, led by\nTop Gun: Maverick\n. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from our linear networks, including the impact from the rotational nature of the rights to air the Super Bowl, which was broadcast on CBS in 2021 but another network in 2022. The absence of the Super Bowl negatively impacted the total revenue comparison by 2 percentage points. The revenue comparison also includes a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange rate changes.\nOperating income for 2022 decreased 63% to $2.34 billion. This comparison was impacted by higher charges in 2022 for restructuring and other corporate matters, as well as lower gains on dispositions. Adjusted OIBDA, which excludes these items, decreased 26%, driven by our investment in our streaming services, and revenue declines from our linear networks, including from the comparison to the broadcast of the Super Bowl in 2021.\nFor 2022, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 83% and 85%, respectively, from 2021, primarily as a result of the decline in operating income. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the items impacting the comparability of operating income noted above, discrete tax benefits of $80 million in 2022 and $517 million in 2021, and the other items described under\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nfor 2022, decreased 49% and 51%, respectively, primarily reflecting the lower Adjusted OIBDA.\nII-4\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nResults for each of the years presented included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.\nBecause the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\n(a) 2022 and 2020 include impairment charges for FCC licenses of $27 million and $25 million, respectively, and 2020 includes accelerated depreciation of $12 million for technology that was abandoned in connection with synergy plans related to the merger of Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “Merger”).\n(b) See notes on the following tables for additional information on items affecting comparability.\nII-5\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Comprised of charges of $328 million for restructuring, as described under\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\n, consisting of severance costs and the impairment of lease assets; $211 million associated with litigation described under\nLegal Matters\n—\nStockholder Matters\n; and $46 million recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\n(b) Reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their estimated fair values.\n(c) Reflects a $41 million gain recognized upon the contribution of certain assets of Paramount+ in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden (the “Nordics”) to SkyShowtime, our streaming joint venture (“SkyShowtime”) as well as gains totaling $15 million from the sale of international intangible assets and a working capital adjustment to the gain from the fourth quarter 2021 sale of CBS Studio Center.\n(d) Reflects a loss on the sale of a 37.5% interest in The CW and an impairment of an investment sold in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n(e) Primarily reflects a deferred tax benefit resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations.\nII-6\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Reflects severance costs and the impairment of lease assets.\n(b) Primarily reflects gains on the sales of CBS Studio Center, 51 West 52nd Street, an office tower that was formerly the headquarters of CBS (“51 West 52nd Street”), and a noncore trademark licensing operation.\n(c) Primarily reflects a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of an investment that was sold during the third quarter of 2021.\n(d) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\n(e) Primarily reflects a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits.\n(f) The weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of reported diluted EPS from continuing operations was 655 million and in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was 646 million. These amounts differ because adjusted diluted EPS excludes the effect of the assumed conversion of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock since the impact would have been antidilutive. As a result, in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding does not include the assumed issuance of shares upon conversion of preferred stock, and preferred stock dividends recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $44 million are deducted from net earnings from continuing operations.\nII-7\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Comprised of charges of $542 million for restructuring, consisting of severance costs, the impairment of lease assets and other exit costs; costs of $56 million incurred in connection with the Merger; and charges of $15 million to write down property and equipment that was classified as held for sale and $5 million for other corporate matters.\n(b) Reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their estimated fair values.\n(c) Reflects accelerated depreciation for technology that was abandoned in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger.\n(d) Primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”).\n(e) Reflects a gain on the sale of CNET Media Group (“CMG”).\n(f) Primarily reflects an increase in the value of our investment in fuboTV, Inc. (“fuboTV”), which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n(g) Primarily reflects a benefit from the remeasurement of our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% enacted during the third quarter of 2020.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - 2022 vs. 2021\nRevenues\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on our global broadcast and cable networks, television stations, and streaming services. For 2022, the 5% decrease in advertising revenues principally reflects the rotational nature of the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl, which aired on CBS in 2021\nII-8\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbut another network in 2022, resulting in a negative impact on the advertising comparison of 4 percentage points. The advertising revenue comparison also includes a negative impact of 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes.\nAffiliate and Subscription\nAffiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television streaming services (“virtual MVPDs” or “vMVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (cable affiliate fees) and our owned television stations (retransmission fees), fees received from television stations for their affiliation with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”), and subscription fees for our streaming services. For 2022, affiliate and subscription revenues increased 11% driven by growth in subscribers for our streaming services of 21.2 million, or 38%, to 77.3 million at December 31, 2022 from 56.1 million at December 31, 2021, led by an increase of 23.1 million for Paramount+ to 55.9 million at December 31, 2022. The increase was partially offset by lower affiliate fees for our linear networks.\nTheatrical\nTheatrical revenues are principally earned from the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. For 2022, theatrical revenues increased $982 million driven by the success of our 2022 releases, led by\nTop Gun: Maverick\n, as well as\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\n,\nSmile\nand\nThe Lost City\n. We had fewer theatrical releases in 2021, due to the impacts from COVID-19 on movie theaters and film production. Releases in 2021 included\nA Quiet Place Part II\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Movie\n.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from the rental of production facilities. Licensing and other revenues for 2022 of $6.49 billion remained flat compared with 2021.\nOperating Expenses\nContent Costs\nContent costs include the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content; amortization of acquired program rights; other television production costs, including on-air talent; and participation and residuals expenses, which reflect amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements.\nII-9\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor 2022, content costs increased 9% reflecting investment in content for our streaming services and higher costs associated with theatrical releases, partially offset by costs in 2021 from CBS’ broadcast of the Super Bowl.\nIn January 2023, we announced that we will be fully integrating Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms later in 2023. In connection with this plan, we have undertaken a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. At the same time, we are rationalizing and right-sizing our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and closing or globalizing certain of our international channels. We plan to complete this review in the first quarter of 2023 and abandon or remove from our platforms certain content, which will result in charges for the impairment or abandonment of the affected content, which we estimate will be approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.\nDistribution and Other\nDistribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including print and advertising for theatrical releases and costs for third-party distribution; compensation; revenue-sharing costs to television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations.\nFor 2022, distribution and other expenses increased 27% primarily reflecting higher costs associated with theatrical content as well as the growth of our streaming services, including costs for third-party distribution and to support the international expansion of our streaming services.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs incurred for advertising, marketing, occupancy, professional service fees, and back office support, including employee compensation and technology. The 10% increase in SG&A expenses in 2022 was driven by advertising, marketing and other cost increases to support the growth and expansion of our streaming services.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including equipment under finance leases, amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, and impairment of fixed and intangible assets, when applicable. For 2022, amortization expense included an impairment charge of $27 million in the\nTV Media\nsegment to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their estimated fair values. The impairment charge was the result of a higher discount rate utilized in our annual impairment tests, reflecting the impacts of market volatility and higher interest rates.\nII-10\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded the following costs associated with restructuring and other corporate matters.\n(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.\nSince the Merger, we have implemented a series of initiatives designed to integrate and transform our operations, including changes in our management structure, some of which resulted in changes to our operating segments (see\nSegments\n). These initiatives led to restructuring actions, and as a result, we recorded restructuring charges of $260 million and $65 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for severance associated with the elimination of positions and changes in management. In 2022, the actions giving rise to the restructuring charges are primarily associated with our segment realignment, our plan to integrate Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, and restructuring of our international operations. In addition, since the Merger we have been consolidating our real estate portfolio to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. In connection with this consolidation, we identified lease assets that we determined we would not use and instead sublease or terminate early, which resulted in lease impairment charges of $68 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAdditionally, in 2022, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $257 million, consisting of $211 million associated with litigation described under\nLegal Matters\n—\nStockholder Matters\nand $46 million recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\nNet Gain on Dispositions\nDuring 2022, we recorded a gain of $41 million relating to the contribution of certain assets of Paramount+ in the Nordics to SkyShowtime. Also in 2022, we recorded gains on dispositions totaling $15 million, comprised of a gain from the sale of international intangible assets and a working capital adjustment to the gain from the fourth quarter 2021 sale of CBS Studio Center.\nDuring 2021, we completed the sale of 51 West 52nd Street to Harbor Group International, LLC, for $760 million. This transaction resulted in a gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $523 million.\nAlso in 2021, we completed the sale of CBS Studio Center to Hackman Capital Partners, LLC and Square Mile Capital Management, LLC for $1.85 billion. This transaction resulted in a gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $1.70 billion.\nIn addition, during 2021 we recognized a net gain of $117 million, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.\nII-11\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nThe following table presents our outstanding debt balances, excluding finance leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investments\nNet gains (losses) from investment for 2022 includes a loss of $4 million on the sale of a 37.5% interest in The CW, which is principally comprised of transaction costs, and a $5 million impairment of an investment that was sold during the fourth quarter of 2022. Net gains (losses) from investments for 2021 primarily includes a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of a marketable security that was sold during the third quarter of 2021.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor 2022 and 2021, we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt of $120 million and $128 million, respectively, associated with the early redemption of long-term debt of $2.91 billion in 2022 and $1.99 billion in 2021.\nOther Items, Net\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net.\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2022, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $227 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 17.9%. Included in the provision for\nII-12\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nincome taxes was a net discrete tax benefit of $80 million, primarily resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. This net discrete tax benefit, together with a net tax benefit of $159 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, which primarily consist of restructuring and other corporate matters,  reduced our effective income tax rate by 6.0 percentage points.\nFor 2021, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $646 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 12.4%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a net discrete tax benefit of $517 million, which includes a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment during the second quarter of 2021 of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits. The net discrete tax benefit of $517 million, together with a net tax provision of $546 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, which principally include net gains on dispositions, reduced our effective income tax rate by 7.8 percentage points.\nEquity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax\nThe following table presents equity in loss of investee companies for our equity-method investments.\nFor 2022, the increase in equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax was driven by our investment in SkyShowtime.\nFor 2021, equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax includes an impairment charge of $34 million relating to a television joint venture.\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Paramount and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to Paramount\nFor 2022, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased 83% and 85%, respectively, driven by the decrease in operating income, including the comparison to net gains on dispositions totaling $2.34 billion in 2021.\nII-13\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations\nIn November 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, which was previously reported as the\nPublishing\nsegment, to Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin Random House”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. As a result, we began presenting Simon & Schuster as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2020. In November 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to block the sale and in October 2022 the Court ruled in favor of the DOJ. In November 2022, we terminated the agreement and in accordance with its terms, subsequently received a $200 million termination fee (see\nLegal Matters\n). Simon & Schuster remains a noncore asset as it does not fit strategically within our video-based portfolio. We expect to enter into a new agreement to sell Simon & Schuster in 2023. Assuming that we do so, closing would be subject to closing conditions that would include regulatory approval. Simon & Schuster continues to be presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. (“Famous Players”).\nII-14\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nConsolidated Results of Operations— 2021 vs. 2020\nRevenues\nAdvertising\nFor 2021, the 17% increase in advertising revenues was driven by the benefit in 2021 from CBS’ broadcasts of\nSuper Bowl LV\nand\nNCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship\n(the “NCAA Tournament”) games for which there were no comparable broadcasts on CBS in 2020 and higher advertising for Pluto TV and Paramount+. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament on a rotational basis with other networks, including in 2021. Additionally, while we share the games in the preceding rounds of the NCAA Tournament with Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”) each year, COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament in 2020. These noncomparable sporting events contributed 8 percentage points of the advertising revenue increase for 2021. The advertising revenue growth also reflected higher pricing and demand compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions for our domestic networks and lower political advertising sales, reflecting the benefit to 2020 from the U.S. Presidential election.\nAffiliate and Subscription\nFor 2021, affiliate and subscription revenues increased 14% driven by growth in subscribers for our streaming services of 26.2 million to 56.1 million at December 31, 2021 from 29.9 million at December 31, 2020, led by an increase of 21.1 million for Paramount+ to 32.8 million at December 31, 2021. The increase also reflects higher affiliate fees for our linear networks, driven by rate increases, the launch of our basic cable networks in June 2020 and April 2021 on two vMVPDs, growth in reverse compensation, and higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact from subscriber declines.\nTheatrical\nFor 2021, the 34% increase in theatrical revenues reflects the benefit from 2021 releases including\nA Quiet Place Part II\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Movie,\nwhile 2020 was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19, following the release of\nSonic the Hedgehog\nin the first quarter of 2020, and throughout the remainder of the year.\nLicensing and Other\nFor 2021, licensing and other revenues increased 5%, reflecting a higher volume of licensing, including from the timing of program availabilities as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 because of COVID-19, and increased licensing for consumer products. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to 2020 from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\n.\nII-15\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperating Expenses\nn/m - not meaningful\nContent Costs\nFor 2021, the 23% increase in production expenses was primarily a result of an increased investment in content for our streaming services; the timing of production, as 2020 was impacted by shutdowns as a result of COVID-19; higher sports programming costs, principally associated with noncomparable sporting events; and higher costs associated with increased licensing revenues and the mix of titles licensed in each year.\nProgramming Charges\nDuring 2020, we recorded programming charges of $159 million primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19.\nDistribution and Other\nFor 2021, the 5% increase was a result of cost increases associated with the growth of our streaming services.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor 2021, the 20% increase in SG&A expenses was driven by advertising, marketing and other cost increases to support the growth and expansion of our streaming services, including the March 2021 launch of Paramount+. The increase also reflects higher advertising and marketing costs to promote the increased level of original programming in 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor 2020, amortization expense included an impairment charge of $25 million in the\nTV Media\nsegment to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their estimated fair values and accelerated depreciation of $12 million resulting from the abandonment of technology in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger.\nII-16\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded the following costs associated with restructuring and other corporate matters.\n(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we recorded restructuring charges of $65 million and $472 million for severance associated with the elimination of positions and changes in management, as well as lease impairment charges of $35 million and $42 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recorded other exit costs of $28 million resulting from the termination of contractual obligations.\nAdditionally, in 2020, we incurred costs of $56 million in connection with the Merger, consisting of professional fees mainly associated with integration activities, as well as transaction-related bonuses. We also incurred costs of $5 million for professional fees associated with dispositions and other corporate matters, and we recorded a charge of $15 million to write down property and equipment, which was classified as held for sale in 2020, to its fair value less costs to sell.\nNet Gain on Dispositions\nDuring 2021, we completed the sale of 51 West 52nd Street to Harbor Group International, LLC, for $760 million. This transaction resulted in a gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $523 million.\nAlso in 2021, we completed the sale of CBS Studio Center to Hackman Capital Partners, LLC and Square Mile Capital Management, LLC for $1.85 billion. This transaction resulted in a gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $1.70 billion.\nIn addition, during 2021 we recognized a net gain of $117 million, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.\nIn October 2020, we completed the sale of CMG to Red Ventures for $484 million. This transaction resulted in a gain of $214 million.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nII-17\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents our outstanding debt balances, excluding finance leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nNet Gains from Investments\nFor 2021, net gains from investments primarily include a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of a marketable security that was sold during the third quarter of 2021. For 2020, net gains from investments primarily reflect an increase of $213 million in the fair value of our investment in fuboTV, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nFor 2021 and 2020, we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt of $128 million and $126 million, respectively, associated with the early redemption of long-term debt of $1.99 billion in 2021 and $2.77 billion in 2020.\nOther Items, Net\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net.\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2021, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $646 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 12.4%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a net discrete tax benefit of $517 million, which includes a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment during the second quarter of 2021 of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits. The net discrete tax benefit of $517 million, together with a net tax provision of $546 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures,\nwhich principally include net gains on dispositions, reduced our effective income tax rate by 7.8 percentage points.\nII-18\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor 2020, the provision for income taxes was $535 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 17.0%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a net discrete tax benefit of $110 million, primarily consisting of a benefit of $100 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of an increase in the UK corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% enacted during the third quarter of 2020, as well as a tax benefit of $13 million realized in connection with the preparation of the 2019 tax returns. These items, together with a net tax benefit of $129 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures,\nincluding restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and net gains from dispositions and investments, reduced our effective income tax rate by 4.1 percentage points.\nEquity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax\nThe following table presents equity in loss of investee companies for our equity-method investments.\nFor 2021 and 2020, equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax includes impairment charges of $34 million and $9 million, respectively, relating to television joint ventures.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor 2020, net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily reflects our joint venture partners’ share of profit from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nto a streaming service.\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Paramount and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to Paramount\nFor 2021, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Paramount and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 90% and 79%, respectively, primarily driven by the above-mentioned gains on dispositions of $1.75 billion, net of tax and higher discrete tax benefits in 2021. The diluted EPS comparison also includes the effect of higher weighted average shares outstanding as a result of stock issuances in the first quarter of 2021, which negatively impacted EPS for 2021 by $.26.\nII-19\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players.\nII-20\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSegments\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer streaming businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that resulted in a change to our operating segments. Our management structure was reorganized to focus on managing our business as the combination of three parts: a traditional media business, a portfolio of domestic and international streaming services, and a film studio. Accordingly, beginning in 2022, and for all periods presented we are reporting results based on the following segments:\nTV Media—\nOur\nTV Media\nsegment consists of our (1) broadcast operations\n—\nthe CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast television network; CBS Stations, our owned television stations; and our international free-to-air networks, Network 10, Channel 5, Telefe, and Chilevisión; (2) premium and basic cable networks, including Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, The Smithsonian Channel, Nickelodeon, BET Media Group, CBS Sports Network, and international extensions of certain of these brands; (3) domestic and international television studio operations, including CBS Studios, Paramount Television Studios and MTV Entertainment Studios as well as CBS Media Ventures, which produces and distributes first-run syndicated programming.\nTV Media\nalso includes a number of digital properties such as CBS News Streaming and CBS Sports HQ\n.\nDirect-to-Consumer\n—\nOur\nDirect-to-Consumer\nsegment consists of our\nportfolio of domestic and international pay and free streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, Showtime Networks’ premium subscription streaming service (“Showtime OTT”), BET+ and Noggin.\nFilmed Entertainment\n—\nOur\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment\nconsists of Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Studio, Awesomeness and Miramax\n.\nIn January 2023, we announced that we will be fully integrating Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms later in 2023.\nWe present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and net gain on dispositions, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. See\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nfor a reconciliation of total Adjusted OIBDA to Operating Income, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP.\nII-21\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSegment Results of Operations - 2022 vs. 2021\nII-22\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nTV Media\nRevenues\nFor 2022, revenues decreased\n4%, primarily reflecting lower advertising revenues, driven by the comparison against CBS’ broadcast of the Super Bowl in 2021, which negatively impacted the total revenue comparison by 2 percentage points.\nAdvertising\nThe 7%\ndecrease in advertising revenues was driven by the rotational nature of the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl, which aired on CBS in 2021 but another network in 2022, resulting in a negative impact on the advertising revenue comparison of 4 percentage points. Additionally, declines for our domestic networks from lower impressions were only partially offset by higher pricing, reflecting softness in the advertising market. The decline also reflects unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes, which negatively impacted the total advertising revenue comparison by 1 percentage point. These decreases were partially offset by higher advertising for our local televisions stations, which benefited the total advertising revenue comparison by 1 percentage point, driven by higher political advertising sales. The total advertising revenue comparison also includes the benefit from the acquisition of Chilevisión in the third quarter of 2021.\nAffiliate and Subscription\nThe 3% decrease in affiliate and subscription revenues mainly reflects lower international affiliate revenues, driven by the restructuring of certain affiliate agreements, resulting in a shift of revenue from our pay television services to our streaming services; unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes, which negatively impacted the total affiliate and subscription revenue comparison by 1 percentage point; and the absence of revenues in Russia after we suspended our operations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022. Domestic affiliate revenues contributed 1% of the decline, primarily reflecting lower revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, as the impact from lower domestic subscribers was substantially offset by rate increases, growth in reverse compensation, and the launch of our basic cable networks on a vMVPD in April 2021.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues for 2022 of $4.20 billion were essentially flat compared with 2021.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased 7%, primarily reflecting the benefit to 2021 from the broadcast of the Super Bowl as well as declines in other advertising revenues and affiliate revenues.\nII-23\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDirect-to-Consumer\n(a) Our streaming subscribers include customers with access to our domestic or international streaming services, either directly through our owned and operated apps and websites, or through third-party distributors.

Global streaming subscribers include subscribers for Paramount+, Showtime OTT and all other subscription streaming services.\n(b) The Monthly Active Users (“MAUs”) count reflects the number of unique devices interacting with the Pluto TV service in a calendar month, and for the periods above reflects the MAU count for the last month of the applicable period.\nRevenues\nFor 2022, revenues increased 47%, led by growth from Paramount+.\nAdvertising\nThe 18% increase in advertising revenues was driven by higher impressions, reflecting the benefit from growth in Paramount+ subscribers.\nPluto TV global MAUs were 78.5 million for December 2022, reflecting growth of 14.1 million, or 22%, from 64.4 million for December 2021, and 6.5 million, or 9%, from 72.0 million for September 2022.\nSubscription\nThe 66% increase in subscription revenues was driven by growth from Paramount+, Showtime OTT, and BET+. Global streaming subscribers grew 21.2 million, or 38%, compared with December 31, 2021, led by an increase of 23.1 million, or 70%, for Paramount+, reflecting significant growth in U.S. subscribers and the impact from launches in international markets. Subscriber growth was impacted by the removal of 1.9 million Paramount+ subscribers following the September 2022 launch of the SkyShowtime streaming service in the Nordics, where it replaced Paramount+ in the market. Growth in subscribers was also impacted by the removal of 3.9 million global\nII-24\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nstreaming subscribers (including 1.2 million for Paramount+) in Russia, where we suspended our operations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter, global streaming subscribers increased 10.8 million, or 16%, to 77.3 million at December 31, 2022 from 66.5 million at September 30, 2022, and Paramount+ subscribers grew 9.9 million, or 22%, to 55.9 million, driven by launches in international markets as well as growth in U.S. subscribers, reflecting the strength of content premieres in the quarter, including\nTulsa King\n,\n1923\nand\nTop Gun: Maverick\n.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased $827 million, as revenue growth was more than offset by higher costs to support growth in our streaming services including content, marketing, distribution, employee and technology costs.\nFilmed Entertainment\nRevenues\nFor 2022, the 38% increase in revenues was primarily driven by\nthe success of\nTop Gun: Maverick\n.\nTheatrical\nThe $982 million increase in theatrical revenues was driven by the success of our 2022 releases, led by\nTop Gun: Maverick\n. We released eight films in 2022, including\nTop Gun: Maverick,\nas well as\nSonic the Hedgehog 2, Smile,\nand\nThe Lost City\n, compared with four films in 2021, including\nA Quiet Place Part II\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Movie\n. The lower number of theatrical releases in 2021 was due to the impacts from COVID-19 on movie theaters and film production.\nLicensing and Other\nThe 1% increase in licensing and other revenues primarily reflects higher licensing of recent theatrical releases in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by the success of\nTop Gun: Maverick\nin the digital home entertainment market, partially offset by the licensing of\nComing 2 America\nand\nTom Clancy’s Without Remorse\nin 2021 and lower revenues from the licensing of library titles.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 31%, mainly reflecting higher profits from 2022 releases, partially offset by lower profits from the licensing of library titles.\nFluctuations in results for the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including print and advertising, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film’s theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms.\nII-25\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSegment Results of Operations - 2021 vs. 2020\nn/m - not meaningful\nII-26\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nTV Media\nRevenues\nFor 2021, revenues increased 8%, reflecting growth across all revenue streams, led by increased advertising revenues, including from CBS’ broadcasts of tentpole sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts on CBS in 2020.\nAdvertising\nThe 12% increase in advertising revenues was driven by CBS’ broadcasts in 2021 of sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts on CBS in 2020, including\nSuper Bowl LV\nand NCAA Tournament games. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament on a rotational basis. The Super Bowl aired on CBS in 2021 but another network in 2020. The national semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament also aired on CBS in 2021, but COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament in 2020, including the games in the preceding rounds of the NCAA Tournament that we share with Turner each year. The advertising revenue growth also reflected higher pricing and demand compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19, as well as a higher level of original programming broadcast in 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions for our domestic networks and lower political advertising sales.\nAffiliate and Subscription\nThe 5% increase in affiliate and subscription revenues was driven by rate increases, the launch of our basic cable networks in June 2020 and April 2021 on two vMVPDs, growth in reverse compensation, and higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact from subscriber declines.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues increased 5%, driven by the timing of program availabilities, primarily from the impact of production shutdowns in 2020 due to COVID-19, as well as higher domestic licensing in the secondary market, reflecting the benefit from several significant licensing arrangements in 2021, including for\nNCIS\nand\nBull\n. The increase was partially offset by the comparison against the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nin 2020.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 1% as the higher revenues were substantially offset by higher costs associated with sports broadcasts, more original programming and higher licensing revenues in 2021.\nII-27\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDirect-to-Consumer\n(a) Prior to its rebranding in March 2021 Paramount+ was named CBS All Access.\nRevenues\nFor 2021, revenues increased 83% reflecting growth across our streaming services.\nAdvertising\nThe 89% increase in advertising revenues reflects growth from Pluto TV and Paramount+. Pluto TV global MAUs were 64.4 million for December 2021, reflecting growth of 21.3 million, or 49%, from 43.1 million for December 2020.\nSubscription\nThe 80% increase in subscription revenues reflects growth across our subscription streaming services. Global streaming subscribers grew 26.2 million, or 88%, compared with December 31, 2020, led by growth from Paramount+, reflecting significant growth in U.S. subscribers and the impact from launches in international markets, as well as subscriber growth for Showtime OTT and BET+.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased $821 million, as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher content, marketing, distribution, and other cost increases to support growth in our streaming services, including for the launch of Paramount+ in 2021.\nII-28\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFilmed Entertainment\nRevenues\nFor 2021, the 9% increase in revenues reflected growth in licensing and theatrical revenues.\nTheatrical\nThe 34% increase in theatrical revenues was driven by 2021 releases including\nA Quiet Place Part II\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Movie\n, while 2020 was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19, following the release of\nSonic the Hedgehog\nin the first quarter of 2020, and throughout the remainder of the year.\nLicensing and Other\nThe 7% increase in licensing and other revenues was driven by the licensing of\nComing 2 America\n,\nTom Clancy’s Without Remorse\nand\nHalloween Kills\nwhile 2020 included licensing of the first quarter 2020 theatrical release\nSonic the Hedgehog\n, but was also impacted by the above-mentioned impact from COVID-19.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 31%, primarily the result of higher profits from licensing.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes; and pension funding obligations. Our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures; acquisitions; funding relating to new and existing investments, including SkyShowtime, our streaming joint venture with Comcast, under which both parent companies have committed to support initial operations over a multiyear period; discretionary share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. Our planned spending in 2023 includes continued increased investment in our streaming services. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, which were $2.89 billion as of December 31, 2022, borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion Credit Facility described below, as well as access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.\nOur funding for long-term obligations, including our long-term debt (see Note 10), and the long-term portion of the other cash requirements discussed above, including contractual commitments for programming and talent (see\nII-29\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNote 20) and lease obligations (see Note 11), as well as those not yet committed to, will come from cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from noncore asset sales, including the planned sale of Simon & Schuster (see\nConsolidated Results of Operations - 2022 vs. 2021\n,\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations)\n, and our ability to refinance our debt. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. In addition, if necessary, we could increase our liquidity position by reducing non-committed spending. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to manage our outstanding debt maturities, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.\nOur access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong balance sheet, cash flows, credit facility and credit ratings will provide us with adequate access to funding for our expected cash needs. The cost of any new borrowings is affected by market conditions and short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.\nCash Flows\nThe changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:\nOperating Activities.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for 2022 was a net use of cash of $142 million compared to a net source of cash of $835 million for 2021. The use of cash in 2022 was mainly the result of significant investment in our streaming services, including spending for content, marketing and distribution costs. The decrease in operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily driven by the decline in Adjusted OIBDA, partially offset by lower payments for income taxes. Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations decreased to $61 million for 2022 from $291 million for 2021, primarily resulting from lower earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, partially offset by the impact of the timing of production tax incentive receipts.\nII-30\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2021 compared to 2020 was mainly driven by our increased investment in our streaming services, including spending for content, advertising and marketing, and a higher level of production in 2021 as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 due to COVID-19. The decrease was partially offset by higher collections and lower payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and transformation initiatives, as well as lower payments for income taxes. Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations decreased to $291 million for 2021 from $411 million for 2020, primarily due to a higher volume of production incentives received, lower adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a higher deduction associated with the exercise and vesting of stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher payments associated with gains from dispositions, primarily from the sale of CBS Studio Center in 2021.\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities included payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and transformation initiatives of $244 million, $294 million and $584 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Since the Merger, we have invested in a number of transformation initiatives. Initially, these were undertaken to realize synergies related to the Merger. Beginning in 2022, our transformation initiatives are related to future-state technology, including the unification and evolution of systems and platforms, and migration to the cloud. In addition, we are investing in future-state workspaces, including adapting our facilities to accommodate our hybrid and agile work model.\nCash flow provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflects the operating activities of Simon & Schuster, and for 2022 also includes the receipt of the $200 million termination fee described under\nLegal Matters-Litigation Related to the Proposed Sale of Simon & Schuster\n.\nInvesting Activities\n(a) Primarily includes investment in The CW in all three years. 2022 also includes investment in SkyShowtime.\n(b) Includes payments associated with the implementation of our transformation initiatives of $45 million, $68 million, and $40 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n(c) 2021 reflects the acquisitions of Chilevisión, a free-to-air television channel, and a controlling interest in Fox TeleColombia & Estudios TeleMexico, a Spanish language content producer. 2020 primarily reflects the acquisition of Miramax, a global film and television studio.\n(d) 2022 primarily reflects proceeds related to the sale of investments and from the disposition of international intangible assets. 2021 primarily reflects proceeds received from the sales of CBS Studio Center and\n51 West 52nd Street. 2021 also includes proceeds received from the sale of our investment in fuboTV during the fourth quarter of 2020, and proceeds received from the sales of a noncore trademark licensing operation and other investments. 2020 reflects the sales of CMG and marketable securities.\nII-31\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFinancing Activities\nDividends\nWe declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we declared total per share dividends of $.96, resulting in total annual dividends of $635 million, $625 million and $601 million, respectively.\nDuring each of the quarters of 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.4375 per share on our 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”), resulting in total annual dividends of $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded total annual dividends on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $44 million. During each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $1.4375 per share. During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $1.5493 per share, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021.\nCapital Structure\nThe following table sets forth our debt.\n(a)    At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $442 million and $466 million, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $89 million and $95 million, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $16.38 billion at December 31, 2022 and $18.27 billion at December 31, 2021.\nII-32\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we redeemed senior notes totaling $2.39 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.49 billion and redeemed, at par, our $520 million of 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057. These redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $120 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued $1.00 billion of 6.375% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. The interest rate on these debentures will reset on March 30, 2027, and every five years thereafter to a fixed rate equal to the 5-year Treasury Rate (as defined pursuant to the terms of the debentures) plus a spread of 3.999% from March 30, 2027, 4.249% from March 30, 2032 and 4.999% from March 30, 2047. These debentures can be called by us at par plus a make whole premium any time before March 30, 2027, or at par on March 30, 2027 or on any interest payment date thereafter.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed senior notes totaling $1.99 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.11 billion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $128 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $4.50 billion of senior notes and redeemed long-term debt totaling $2.77 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.88 billion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $126 million.\nOur 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rate until February 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate. Under the terms of the debentures the floating rate is based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.899%, reset quarterly, however, with the phasing out of LIBOR and the passage of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, signed into law on March 15, 2022, it is expected that the 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due 2057 will, upon switching to a floating rate, bear interest at a replacement rate based on three-month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). These debentures can be called by us at par at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.\nThe subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\nThe interest rate payable on our 3.45% senior notes due October 2026, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to these senior notes. The interest rate on these senior notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade, up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of these senior notes was $124 million.\nSome of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.\nCommercial Paper\nAt both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nII-33\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCredit Facility\nAt December 31, 2022, we had a $3.50 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR rates, respectively. The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than 4.5x (which we may elect to increase to 5.0x for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. On February 14, 2022, we amended our Credit Facility to modify the definition of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio in the amended credit agreement to allow unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness through June 2024\n.\nWe met the covenant as of December 31, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $3.50 billion.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had bank borrowings under Miramax’s $300 million credit facility, which matures in April 2023, of $55 million and $35 million, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of 7.09% and 3.50%, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Significant judgments used in\nII-34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales or bundled content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.\nAffiliate Revenues\n—The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and vMVPDs, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming.\nContent Licensing Revenues\n—For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues.\nFilm and Television Production and Programming Costs\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. The costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. Acquired programming rights, including rights for sports programming, are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nWe categorize our capitalized production and programming costs based on the expected predominant monetization strategy throughout the life of the content.  Our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized through licensing and distribution on third-party platforms is considered individually monetized and our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized on our networks and streaming services together with other programming is considered to be monetized as part of a film group. The predominant\nII-35\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nmonetization strategy is determined when capitalization of production costs commences and is reassessed if there is a significant change to the expected future monetization strategy. This reassessment will include an assessment of the monetization strategy throughout the entire life of the programming.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. Management’s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate Revenues and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or feature film. These estimates are used to determine the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participation and residual costs.\nFor television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. For films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of Ultimate Revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information.\nFor acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. Such estimates require management’s judgment and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, and, for acquired programming, the length of the license period. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues, an accelerated method of amortization is used. These estimates are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term or life of each program.\nFor content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. If the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the film group is less than its unamortized costs. A change in the\nII-36\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nmonetization strategy of content, whether monetized individually or as part of a film group, will result in a reassessment of the predominant monetization strategy and may trigger an assessment of the content for impairment. Any resulting impairment test will be performed either at the individual level, if the predominant monetization strategy is determined to be individual, or at the film group level where the future cash flows will be generated. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that has been abandoned are written off.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Tests\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nFCC Licenses\n—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2022, we had 14 television markets with FCC license book values.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. For the 2022 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for nine of our television markets. For each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as average market share. We also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test on these markets was unnecessary.\nWe performed a quantitative impairment test for the FCC licenses in the remaining five markets. The quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. The discount rate and the long-term growth rate were 8% and 1%, respectively.\nThe impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in two of the markets were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $27 million to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $184 million. The impairment charge, which is included within “Depreciation and amortization” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and recorded within the\nTV Media\nsegment, was the result of a higher discount rate utilized in our annual impairment tests, reflecting the impacts of market volatility and higher interest rates. Additionally, the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in the three remaining markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of $787 million, were each within 10% of their respective carrying values. An increase to the discount rate of 15 basis points, or a decrease to the long-term growth rate of 20 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would\nII-37\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ncause the fair value of FCC licenses in two of the markets to fall below their carrying values. For the third market, an increase to the discount rate of 26 basis points, or a decrease to the long-term rate of 36 basis points, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair value to fall below its carrying value.\nThe estimated fair values of FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including continued market volatility and increases in interest rates, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A further downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in an additional impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nGoodwill\n—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. For our annual impairment test, we perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that we estimate has a fair value that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2022 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included actual and expected financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments within the industry. Our assessment indicated that macroeconomic factors have negatively impacted inputs used in our most recent impairment tests, including discount rates, certain industry growth rates, and comparable company trading multiples. While this indicates that the estimated fair values of our reporting units have declined, considering the aggregation of all relevant factors, including the significant headroom in our most recent test performed in January 2022, which is described below, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units continues to be higher than their respective carrying amounts. Therefore, performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary.\nCertain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, further increases in interest rates, prolonged weakness in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content and platforms could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. A significant adverse change in these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe annual test was performed on the six reporting units in place at October 31, 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of a management reorganization, the reporting units within our\nTV Media\nsegment changed from three to two reporting units. Accordingly, we reallocated goodwill using a relative fair value approach and performed further qualitative goodwill impairment assessments on the two reporting units subsequent to the reallocation of goodwill, and concluded that the fair values of these reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values.\nII-38\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn the first quarter of 2022, in connection with changes to our management structure and the resulting change in operating segments, we reassessed our reporting units and reallocated goodwill from the four reporting units in place prior to the realignment to six reporting units, using a relative fair value approach. We performed goodwill impairment tests as of January 1, 2022 on the reporting units in place before and after the change.\nFor these impairment tests, we performed quantitative tests for three of the reporting units that existed prior to the change and five of the reporting units in place subsequent to the change. For the quantitative goodwill impairment test we calculate an estimated fair value to determine whether it exceeds the carrying value of the respective reporting unit. For one of the quantitative tests, we estimated fair value based on the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses, and for the remaining quantitative tests, we estimated the fair value based on both the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses. The Discounted Cash Flow Method requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. The assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. The terminal value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on historical and projected inflation and economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. A discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. We utilized discount rates ranging from 9% to 13.5% and terminal values that were based on either growth rates ranging from 1% to 2% or revenue multiples ranging from 1.5x to 2.7x. Traded and transaction values were determined using revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit as well as revenue and earnings multiples from recent transactions of these companies. The selected multiples consider each reporting unit’s relative growth, profitability, size, and risk relative to the selected publicly traded companies. Based on the results of these impairment tests, we concluded that the estimated fair values of the reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, no impairment charge was required.\nFor one of the reporting units, we performed a qualitative assessment before and after the reporting unit change and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was higher than its carrying amount.\nLegal Matters\nEstimates of liabilities related to legal issues and predecessor operations, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We continually evaluate these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods, and as a result our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.\nII-39\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nPensions\nPension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2022, changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss compared with the prior year-end due to an increase in the discount rate, which was partially offset by the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $80 million and would have an insignificant impact on 2023 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $6 million to 2023 pension expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions.  When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. While valuation allowances can require significant judgment, we believe the valuation allowance of $488 million at December 31, 2022 properly reduces our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nA number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $303 million at December 31, 2022 is properly recorded.\nII-40\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “Litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStockholder Matters\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning in February 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. In March 2020, the Court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees’ Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. In April 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, members of the CBS Board of Directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13, 2019, between CBS and Viacom (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with Mr. Ianniello’s compensation. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In June 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. In January 2021, the Court dismissed one disclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. In December 2022, the Court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against Mr. Klieger. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. A six-day trial is scheduled to begin in June 2023. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nBeginning in November 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. In January 2020, the Court consolidated the four lawsuits. In February 2020, the Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. Subsequently, in February 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In May 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. In December 2020, the Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. A six-day trial is scheduled to begin in July 2023. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nII-41\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInvestigation-Related Matters\nAs announced in August 2018, the CBS Board of Directors retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. In December 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board of Directors’ determination with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment.\nIn August 2018 and in October 2018, Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the U.S District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. In November 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. Subsequently, in November 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. In February 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board of Directors. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. In April 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part in January 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit for $14.75 million, which was paid by our insurers. The settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, was granted final approval by the Court in November 2022.\nWe also received subpoenas or requests for information from the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, the New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding the subject matter of the CBS Board of Directors’ investigation and related matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. In November 2022, we entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance with the Investor Protection Bureau of the New York State Attorney General’s Office to resolve that matter. After credits for the settlement amount to be paid in the consolidated federal securities class action discussed above, and certain financial commitments to human resources-related programs made by CBS in connection with an earlier resolution with the Civil Rights Bureau of the New York State Attorney General’s Office, the Company has made a payment of $7.25 million, which by agreement with the Investor Protection Bureau will be distributed in connection with the federal securities class action settlement discussed above. The resolution with the Investor Protection Bureau includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company. In December 2022, we received a termination letter from the SEC, indicating that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future.\nLitigation Related to Stock Offerings\nIn August 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and in November 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”). The Complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was\nII-42\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nfiled against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in January 2023. On February 7, 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed.\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owner\ns\nIn September 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about January 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. In October 2019, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the Court in November 2020. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to Court approval.\nLitigation Related to the Proposed Sale of Simon & Schuster\nIn November 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block our sale of the Simon & Schuster business to Penguin Random House pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated November 24, 2020, between the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, Penguin Random House and Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. In October 2022, following a bench trial, the Court blocked the sale. In November 2022, we terminated the Purchase Agreement and subsequently received a $200 million termination fee.\nClaims Related to Former Businesses\nAsbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2022, we had pending approximately 21,580 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 27,770 as of December 31, 2021 and 30,710 as of December 31, 2020. During 2022, we received approximately 2,840 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 9,030 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal\nII-43\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\norder has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2022 and 2021 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $57 million and $63 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods, and as a result our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.\nOther\nFrom time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.\nII-44\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $3.06 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively. For 2022, $2.40 billion related to future production costs and $655 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2021, $1.38 billion related to future production costs and $564 million\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nInterest Risk\nInterest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify this exposure at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at December 31, 2022 or 2021 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $15.78 billion and the estimated fair value was $13.9 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.48 billion and $634 million, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nWe continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2022 or 2021, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements."

Paramount Global and its subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework set forth in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nII-47\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Paramount Global\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Paramount Global and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nII-48\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAmortization of Internally-Produced Television Programming Inventory that is Predominantly Monetized on an Individual Basis\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. For internally-produced television programs that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, management uses an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets, and future firm commitments to license programs.\nT\nhe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when estimating Ultimate Revenues; this led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating management’s estimate of Ultimate Revenues and the significant assumptions that are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets, and future firm commitments to license programs.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly\nII-49\nmonetized on an individual basis, including the controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for estimating Ultimate Revenues, and (ii) evaluating whether the significant assumptions were reasonable considering information related to the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs. Procedures were also performed to test the completeness and accuracy of management's data used in these estimates.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 16, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1970.\nII-50\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-51\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-52\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-53\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-54\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions)\n(a)\nPrimarily reflects the acquisition of Miramax (see Note 2).\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nII-55\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n1)\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business\n—Effective February 16, 2022, we changed our name from ViacomCBS Inc. to Paramount Global, and effective at the open of market trading on February 17, 2022, our Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock  (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”) ceased trading under the ticker symbols “VIACA,” “VIAC” and “VIACP” and began trading under the ticker symbols “PARAA,” “PARA” and “PARAP,” respectively, on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. References to “Paramount,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Paramount Global and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer streaming businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that resulted in a change to our operating segments. Our management structure was reorganized to focus on managing our business as the combination of three parts: a traditional media business, a portfolio of domestic and international streaming services, and a film studio. Accordingly, for all periods presented we are reporting results based on the following segments:\n•\nTV Media—\nOur\nTV Media\nsegment consists of our (1) broadcast operations\n—\nthe CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast television network; CBS Stations, our owned television stations; and our international free-to-air networks, Network 10, Channel 5, Telefe, and Chilevisión; (2) premium and basic cable networks, including Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, The Smithsonian Channel, Nickelodeon, BET Media Group, CBS Sports Network, and international extensions of certain of these brands; (3) domestic and international television studio operations, including CBS Studios, Paramount Television Studios and MTV Entertainment Studios, as well as CBS Media Ventures, which produces and distributes first-run syndicated programming.\nTV Media\nalso includes a number of digital properties such as CBS News Streaming and CBS Sports HQ\n.\n•\nDirect-to-Consumer\n—\nOur\nDirect-to-Consumer\nsegment consists of our portfolio of domestic and international pay and free streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, Showtime Networks’ premium subscription streaming service (Showtime OTT), BET+ and Noggin.\n•\nFilmed Entertainment\n—\nOur\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment consists of Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Studio, Awesomeness and Miramax\n.\nIn January 2023, we announced that we will be fully integrating Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms later in 2023.\nDiscontinued Operations\n—In November 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, which was previously reported as the\nPublishing\nsegment, to Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin Random House”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. As a result, we began presenting Simon & Schuster as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2020. In November 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to block the sale and in October 2022 the Court ruled in favor of the DOJ. In November 2022, we terminated the agreement and in accordance with its terms, subsequently received a $\n200\nmillion termination fee. Simon & Schuster remains a noncore asset as it does not fit strategically within our video-based portfolio. We expect to enter into a new agreement to sell Simon & Schuster in 2023. Assuming that we do so, closing would be subject to closing conditions that would include regulatory approval. Simon & Schuster continues to be presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented (see Note 3).\nII-56\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Paramount, its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are considered the primary beneficiary, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third party participating rights.  Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of net earnings or loss of the entity is recorded in “Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nReclassifications\n—Certain amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.\nUse of Estimates\n—The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nBusiness Combinations\n—We generally account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets, liabilities and certain contingent liabilities acquired, as well as amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at fair value. Any transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n—Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, including money market funds, commercial paper and bank time deposits.\nProgramming Inventory\n—We produce and acquire rights to programming to exhibit on our broadcast and cable networks, direct to consumers through our streaming services, on our broadcast television stations, and in theaters. We also produce programming for third parties. Costs for internally-produced and acquired programming inventory, including prepayments for such costs, are recorded within the non-current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prepayments for the rights to air sporting and other live events that are expected to be expensed over the next 12 months are classified within the current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films (which include direct production costs, production overhead, acquisition costs and development costs) are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. Costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nIn addition, production inventory is reduced by contributions from co-production partners, as applicable, and tax incentives earned for qualified production spending in certain U.S. states and international locations. As a result, the benefit of these items will be recognized through reduced amortization over the life of the related content.  Included in “Other current assets” and “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 were receivables for production tax incentives of $\n0.3\nbillion and $\n1.4\nbillion, respectively.\nII-57\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe categorize our capitalized production and programming costs based on the expected predominant monetization strategy throughout the life of the content.  Our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized through licensing and distribution on third-party platforms is considered individually monetized and our programming that is expected to be predominantly monetized on our networks and streaming services together with other programming, is considered to be monetized as part of a film group. The predominant monetization strategy is determined when capitalization of production costs commences and is reassessed if there is a significant change to the expected future monetization strategy. This reassessment will include an assessment of the monetization strategy throughout the entire life of the programming.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues impacts the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participations and residual costs. For television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within\n10\nyears from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production,\nfive years\nfrom the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within\n10\nyears from the date of a film’s initial release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. For acquired television and film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within\n20\nyears from the date of acquisition. Ultimate Revenue estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to inventory amortization rates and estimated accruals for residuals and participations.\nFilm development costs that have not been set for production are expensed within\nthree years\nunless they are abandoned earlier, in which case these projects are written down to their estimated fair value in the period the decision to abandon the project is determined.\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received and amortized over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the relative value of the events broadcast by us during a period in relation to the estimated total value of the events over the term of the sports programming agreement.\nFor content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the film group is less\nII-58\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthan its unamortized costs. If the carrying value of a film group or individual television program or feature film exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded in the amount of the difference. A change in the monetization strategy of content, whether monetized individually or as part of a film group, will result in a reassessment of the predominant monetization strategy and may trigger an assessment of the content for impairment. Any resulting impairment test will be performed either at the individual level, if the predominant monetization strategy is determined to be individual, or at the film group level where the future cash flows will be generated. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that has been abandoned are written off.\nTelevision and feature film programming and production costs, including inventory amortization, development costs, residuals and participations and impairment charges, if any, are included within “Operating expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nProperty and Equipment\n—Property and equipment is stated at cost.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:\nCosts associated with repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n—The Company assesses long-lived assets and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these asset groups is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups to their net carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the amount of impairment charge, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets.\nInvestments\n—Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Equity investments for which we have no significant influence are measured at fair value where a readily determinable fair value exists. Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable price changes. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of equity investments are recorded in “Net gains (losses) from investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We monitor our investments for impairment and reduce the carrying value of the investment if we determine that an impairment charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information. Our investments are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n—Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at or one level below our operating segments. Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of trade names, licenses, and customer agreements are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from\n5\nto\n40\nyears. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist primarily of FCC licenses, are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. If the carrying value of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized\n(see Note 6).\nII-59\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nGuarantees\n—At the inception of a guarantee, we recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing the guarantee. The related liability is subsequently reduced as utilized or extinguished and increased if there is a probable loss associated with the guarantee which exceeds the value of the recorded liability.\nTreasury Stock\n—Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method. Retirements of treasury stock are reflected as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nFair Value Measurements\n—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The framework for measuring fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Certain assets and liabilities, including foreign currency hedges and deferred compensation liabilities, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other assets and liabilities, including television and film production costs, lease assets, goodwill, intangible assets, and equity-method investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairment charges, if applicable, are generally determined using discounted cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n—Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in “Other items, net”\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n”\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently recognized in net earnings when the hedged items are recognized.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\n—The service cost component of net benefit cost for our pension and postretirement benefits is recorded on the same line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as other compensation costs of the related employees. All of the other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOther Liabilities\n—Other liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, long-term income tax liabilities, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals.\nRevenues\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of that good or service.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. Advertising spots are typically sold as part of advertising campaigns consisting of multiple commercial units. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. Audience ratings and impressions are determined\nII-60\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nbased on data provided by independent third-party companies. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.  Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.\nAffiliate and Subscription Revenues\n—Affiliate and subscription revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television streaming services (“virtual MVPDs”, or “vMVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”) and our owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); fees received from television stations for their affiliation with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”); and subscription fees for our subscription streaming services. Costs incurred for advertising, marketing and other services provided to us by cable, satellite and other distributors that are in exchange for a distinct service are recorded as expenses. If a distinct service is not received, such costs are recorded as a reduction to revenues.\nThe performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and vMVPDs, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming. For affiliate revenues, payments are generally due monthly. Subscription revenues to our streaming services are recognized evenly over the subscription period.\nTheatrical Revenues\n—Theatrical revenue is earned from the theatrical distribution of our films during the exhibition period. Under these arrangements, revenues are recognized based on sales to the end customer.\nLicensing and Other Revenues\n—Licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced or distributed for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include revenues from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services, and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and revenues from the rental of production facilities.\nFor licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues. Agreements to license programming are often long term, with collection terms ranging from\none\nto\nfive years\n.\nII-61\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWhen payment is due from a customer more than one year before or after revenue is recognized, we consider the contract to contain a significant financing component and the transaction price is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money. We do not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if payment is expected within one year of recognizing revenues.\nWe also license our programming to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and similar services. Under these arrangements, our performance obligation is the delivery of our content to such distributors who then license our content to the end customer. Our revenues are determined each month based on a contractual rate applied to the number of licenses to the distributors’ end customers. Similarly, revenues earned from electronic sell-through services are recognized as each program is downloaded by the end customer.\nRevenues associated with the licensing of our brands for consumer products, recreation and live events are generally determined based on contractual royalty rates applied to sales reported by the licensees. For consumer products and recreation arrangements that include minimum guaranteed consideration, revenue is recognized as sales occur by the licensee, if the sales-based consideration is expected to exceed the minimum guarantee, or ratably if it is not expected to exceed the minimum guarantee. For live events, we recognize revenue when the event is held.\nRevenues from the sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers are recognized upon the later of the physical delivery to the customer or the date that any sales restrictions on the retailers are lifted.\nWe earn revenues from the distribution of content on behalf of third parties. We also have arrangements for the distribution or sale of our content by third parties. Under such arrangements, we determine whether revenues should be recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer or the net amount of revenue we retain after payment to the third party producer or distributor, based on an assessment of which party controls the good or service being transferred.\nRevenue Allowances\n—DVDs and Blu-ray discs are generally sold with a right of return. We record a provision for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon an estimate of future returns, rebates and other incentives. In determining this provision, we consider sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecast sales data, customers’ rights of return, sales levels for units already shipped, historical return rates for similar products, current economic trends, the competitive environment, promotions and our sales strategies. Reserves for sales returns and allowances of $\n70\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nReserves for accounts receivable reflect our expected credit losses, which are estimated based on historical experience, as well as current and expected economic conditions and industry trends. Our allowance for credit losses was $\n111\nmillion and $\n80\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was $\n40\nmillion in 2022, $\n8\nmillion in 2021 and $\n32\nmillion in 2020. The expense in 2022 principally includes a charge for amounts due from customers in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022 (see Note 7).\nII-62\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nContract Liabilities\n—A contract liability is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to fully satisfying a performance obligation in a contract. Our contract liabilities primarily consist of cash received related to advertising arrangements for which the required audience rating or impressions have not been delivered; consumer products arrangements with minimum guarantees; and content licensing arrangements under which the content has not yet been made available to the customer. These contract liabilities will be recognized as revenues when control of the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Contract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCollaborative Arrangements\n—Collaborative arrangements primarily consist of joint efforts with third parties to produce and distribute programming such as television series and live sporting events, including the agreement between us and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. to telecast the\nNCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship\n(the “NCAA Tournament”), which runs through 2032. In connection with this agreement for the NCAA Tournament, advertisements aired on the CBS Television Network are recorded as revenues and our share of the program rights fees and other operating costs are recorded as operating expenses.\nWe also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute film and television programming, under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the program in specific territories or distribution windows. Under these arrangements, our share of costs for co-productions are initially capitalized as programming inventory and amortized over the estimated economic life of the program. In such arrangements where we have distribution rights, all proceeds generated from such distribution are recorded as revenues and any participation profits due to third party collaborators are recorded as participation expenses. In co-production arrangements where third party collaborators have distribution rights, our net participating profits are recorded as revenues.\nAmounts attributable to transactions arising from collaborative arrangements between participants were not material to the consolidated financial statements for any period presented.\nLeases\n—Our leases are principally comprised of operating leases for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. We determine that a contract contains a lease if we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, and the right to direct the use of, an asset identified in the contract. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability representing the present value of future lease payments. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or our collateralized incremental borrowing rate. For those contracts that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset (“non-lease costs”), we generally include both the lease costs and non-lease costs in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. We also own buildings and production facilities where we lease space to lessees.\nOur leases generally have remaining terms of up to\n14\nyears and often contain renewal options to extend the lease for periods of generally up to\n10\nyears. For leases that contain renewal options, we include the renewal period in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense and income for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the exception of variable lease costs, which are expensed as incurred, and leases of assets used in the production of programming, which are capitalized in programming assets and amortized over the projected useful life of the related programming.\nAdvertising\n—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe incurred total advertising expenses of $\n2.69\nbillion in 2022, $\n2.14\nbillion in 2021 and $\n1.31\nbillion in 2020.\nII-63\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInterest\n—Costs associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as debt discounts or premiums, are recorded as interest over the term of the related debt.\nIncome Taxes\n—The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. We recognize the tax on global intangible low-taxed income, a U.S. tax on certain income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, as a period cost when incurred within the provision for income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor tax positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized.  A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. We recognize interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\n—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the United States (“U.S.”) Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods. The resulting translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Argentina has been designated as a highly inflationary economy during all periods presented. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency will result in remeasurement gains and losses, which are included in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Earnings per Common Share\n—Basic net earnings per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Net earnings available to common stockholders is calculated as net earnings from continuing operations or net earnings, as applicable, adjusted to include dividends on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which was issued in March 2021 (see Note 15).\nWeighted average shares for diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted share units (“RSUs”) or performance share units (“PSUs”) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive. Diluted EPS also reflects the effect of the assumed conversion of preferred stock, if dilutive, which includes the issuance of common shares in the weighted average number of shares and excludes the above-mentioned preferred stock dividend adjustment to net earnings available to common stockholders.\nExcluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been antidilutive, were stock options and RSUs of\n11\nmillion,\n6\nmillion and\n22\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2022, was the effect of the assumed conversion of\n10\nmillion shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of\nII-64\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ncommon stock because the impact would have been antidilutive.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nAdditionally, because the impact of the assumed conversion of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock would have been antidilutive, net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings used in our calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2022 include the preferred stock dividends recorded during the period.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings to the amounts used in the calculations of basic and diluted EPS.\nStock-based Compensation\n—We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity\nOn January 1, 2022, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended guidance to reduce complexity associated with the accounting for convertible instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. Under this guidance, embedded conversion features associated with convertible instruments no longer need to be separated from the host contracts unless they are required to be accounted for as derivatives or have been issued at a substantial premium. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, this guidance removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exceptions. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nII-65\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2)\nACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2021, we made payments totaling $\n54\nmillion, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Chilevisión, a free-to-air television channel, and a controlling interest in Fox TeleColombia & Estudios TeleMexico, a Spanish language content producer. The results of these companies are included in the\nTV Media\nsegment from the dates of acquisition.\nDuring 2020, we acquired a\n49\n% interest in Miramax, a global film and television studio, for $\n375\nmillion, which included a cash payment at closing of approximately $\n150\nmillion along with a commitment to invest $\n45\nmillion annually, beginning on the first anniversary of the closing and continuing through 2025, to be used for new film and television productions and working capital. In conjunction with this acquisition, we entered into commercial agreements with Miramax under which we have exclusive, long-term distribution rights to Miramax’s catalog, which added more than\n700\ntitles to our existing library. We also have certain rights to co-produce, co-finance and/or distribute new film and television projects. The investment is accounted for as a consolidated VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE due to our power to direct the distribution of Miramax’s films and television series, which is considered the most significant activity of the VIE. The results of Miramax are included in the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment from the date of acquisition.\nThe operating results of these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements in the year of acquisition.\nDispositions\nIn September 2022, in connection with our funding commitments under our streaming joint venture, SkyShowtime, we made a noncash contribution of certain assets of Paramount+ in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden (the “Nordics”) to the joint venture, which resulted in a gain of $\n41\nmillion. Upon the transfer of these assets, the SkyShowtime service was launched in the Nordics, where it replaced Paramount+.\nAlso in 2022, we recorded gains on dispositions totaling $\n15\nmillion, comprised of a gain from the sale of international intangible assets and a working capital adjustment to the gain from the fourth quarter 2021 sale of CBS Studio Center, which is described below.\nDuring October 2021, we completed the sale of 51 West 52nd Street, an office tower that was formerly the headquarters of CBS, to Harbor Group International, LLC, for $\n760\nmillion, resulting in a gain of $\n523\nmillion. We have a lease for a portion of the space we occupied with terms that end in 2023 and 2024.\nIn December 2021, we completed the sale of CBS Studio Center to a partnership formed by Hackman Capital Partners, LLC and Square Mile Capital Management, LLC for $\n1.85\nbillion. At closing, we executed a\n10\n-year lease-back of the portion of a building on the property that is used by our Los Angeles television stations. The lease-back began at the time of the sale and includes an option to terminate one floor without penalty beginning on the fifth anniversary. The sale resulted in a gain of $\n1.70\nbillion.\nIn addition, during 2021 we recognized a net gain of $\n117\nmillion, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.\nIn October 2020, we completed the sale of CNET Media Group to Red Ventures for $\n484\nmillion.\nThis transaction resulted in a gain of $\n214\nmillion.\nII-66\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n3)\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, which primarily relates to Simon & Schuster (see Note 1).\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. (“Famous Players”).\nII-67\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents the major classes of assets and liabilities of our discontinued operations.\n4)\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n(a) Included in depreciation expense for 2020 is $\n12\nmillion of accelerated depreciation resulting from the abandonment of technology in connection with synergy plans related to the merger of Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “Merger”).\n5)\nPROGRAMMING AND OTHER INVENTORY\nThe following table presents our programming and other inventory at December 31, 2022 and 2021, grouped by type and predominant monetization strategy. During the first quarter of 2022, in connection with our increased strategic focus on our streaming businesses, we reassessed our predominant monetization strategy for certain of our internally-produced content, and determined that it had shifted from individual to film group as a result of expected increased monetization of the content on our streaming services.\nII-68\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents amortization of television and film programming and production costs, which is included within “\nOperating expenses\n” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nProgramming Charges\nIncluded in the table above for the year ended December 31, 2020, are programming charges of $\n159\nmillion primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Programming charges of $\n154\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion are included within the\nTV Media\nand\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegments, respectively.\nIn connection with our plan to integrate Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms in 2023, we have undertaken a comprehensive strategic review of the combined content portfolio of Showtime and Paramount+. At the same time, we are rationalizing and right-sizing our international operations to align with our streaming strategy, and closing or globalizing certain of our international channels. We plan to complete this review in the first quarter of 2023 and abandon or remove from our platforms certain content, which will result in charges for the impairment or abandonment of the affected content, which we estimate will be approximately $\n1.3\nbillion to $\n1.5\nbillion.\nII-69\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents the expected amortization over each of the next three years of released programming inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022. This information does not include the expected effects of the 2023 programming charges discussed above.\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2023, we expect to amortize approximately $\n63\nmillion of our completed, not yet released film inventory, which is monetized on an individual basis\n.\n6)\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, on an annual basis, and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31, 2022, we had\nfive\nreporting units. FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2022, we had\n14\ntelevision markets with FCC license book values.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for the reporting units and television markets with FCC licenses that we estimate have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In making this determination, we also consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2022 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for\nnine\nof our television markets and all of our reporting units. Considering the aggregation of all relevant factors, including the significant headroom in our most recent tests, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and the fair value of FCC licenses within each of these markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test for these reporting units and FCC licenses was unnecessary.\nFor the 2022 annual test for FCC licenses, we performed a quantitative impairment test for the remaining\nfive\nmarkets. The quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. The discount rate and the long-term growth rate were\n8\n% and\n1\n%, respectively. The impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in\ntwo\nof the markets were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $\n27\nmillion to write down the carrying values of these FCC licenses to their aggregate estimated fair value of $\n184\nmillion. The impairment charge, which is included within “Depreciation and amortization” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and recorded within the\nTV Media\nsegment, was the result of a higher discount rate utilized in our annual impairment tests, reflecting the\nII-70\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nimpacts of market volatility and higher interest rates. Additionally, the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in the\nthree\nremaining markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of $\n787\nmillion, were each within\n10\n% of their respective carrying values.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of a management reorganization, the reporting units within our\nTV Media\nsegment changed from\nthree\nto\ntwo\nreporting units. Accordingly, we reallocated goodwill using a relative fair value approach and performed further qualitative goodwill impairment assessments on the\ntwo\nreporting units subsequent to the reallocation of goodwill, and concluded that the fair values of these reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, in connection with changes to our management structure and the resulting change in operating segments, we reassessed our reporting units and reallocated goodwill from the\nfour\nreporting units in place prior to the realignment to\nsix\nreporting units, using a relative fair value approach. We performed goodwill impairment tests as of January 1, 2022 on the reporting units in place before and after the change and concluded that the fair values of these reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values with significant estimated headroom and, therefore, no impairment charge was required.\nThe following tables present the changes in the book value of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nII-71\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOur intangible assets were as follows:\nII-72\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAmortization expense was as follows:\n(a) For 2022 and 2020,\namortization expense\nincludes impairment charges of $\n27\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion, respectively, to write down the carrying value of FCC licenses, which were recorded within the\nTV Media\nsegment.\nWe expect our aggregate annual amortization expense for existing intangible assets subject to amortization for each of the years, 2023 through 2027, to be as follows:\n7)\nRESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CORPORATE MATTERS\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded the following costs associated with restructuring and other corporate matters.\n(a) Severance costs include the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation.\nRestructuring Charges\nSince the Merger, we have implemented a series of initiatives designed to integrate and transform our operations, including changes in our management structure, some of which resulted in changes to our operating segments (see Note 1). These initiatives led to restructuring actions, and as a result, we recorded restructuring charges of $\n260\nmillion, $\n65\nmillion, and $\n472\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for severance associated with the elimination of positions and changes in management. In 2022, the actions giving\nII-73\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nrise to the restructuring charges are primarily associated with our segment realignment, our plan to integrate Showtime into Paramount+ across both streaming and linear platforms, and restructuring of our international operations. In addition, since the Merger we have been consolidating our real estate portfolio to reduce our real estate footprint and create cost synergies. In connection with this consolidation, we identified lease assets that we determined we would not use and instead sublease or terminate early, which resulted in lease impairment charges of $\n68\nmillion, $\n35\nmillion, and $\n42\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the lease assets that we plan to sublease, the impairment charges were the result of a decline in market conditions since the inception of these leases and reflect the difference between the estimated fair values, which were determined based on the expected discounted future cash flows of the lease assets, and the carrying values. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recorded other exit costs of $\n28\nmillion resulting from the termination of contractual obligations.\nThe following is a rollforward of our restructuring liability, which is recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The majority of the restructuring liability at December 31, 2022, which primarily relates to severance payments, is expected to be paid by the end of 2023.\n(a) For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, excludes stock-based compensation expense of $\n14\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion, respectively, and lease asset impairments of $\n68\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion, respectively.\nOther Corporate Matters\nIn 2022, in addition to the above-mentioned restructuring charges, we recorded charges for other corporate matters of $\n257\nmillion, consisting of $\n211\nmillion associated with litigation described under\nLegal Matters\n—\nStockholder Matters\nin Note 20 and $\n46\nmillion recorded following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, principally to reserve against amounts due from counterparties in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.\nIn 2020, in addition to the above-mentioned restructuring charges, we incurred costs of $\n56\nmillion in connection with the Merger, consisting of professional fees mainly associated with integration activities, as well as transaction-related bonuses. We also incurred costs of $\n5\nmillion for professional fees associated with dispositions and other corporate matters, and we recorded a charge of $\n15\nmillion to write down property and equipment, which was classified as held for sale in 2020, to its fair value less costs to sell.\nII-74\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n8)\nRELATED PARTIES\nNational Amusements, Inc.\nNational Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) is the controlling stockholder of the Company. At December 31, 2022, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately\n77.4\n% of our voting Class A Common Stock and approximately\n9.8\n% of our Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. NAI is controlled by the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Part B General Trust (the “General Trust”), which owns\n80\n% of the voting interest of NAI and acts by majority vote of\nseven\nvoting trustees (subject to certain exceptions), including with respect to the NAI shares held by the General Trust. Shari E. Redstone, Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI and non-executive Chair of our Board of Directors, is one of the\nseven\nvoting trustees for the General Trust and is one of\ntwo\nvoting trustees who are beneficiaries of the General Trust. No member of our management or other member of our Board of Directors is a trustee of the General Trust.\nOther Related Parties\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in transactions with our equity-method investees, primarily for the licensing of television and film programming.\nThe following tables present the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to these transactions.\n(a) Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 include amounts related to SkyShowtime.\nThrough the normal course of business, we are involved in other transactions with related parties that have not been material in any of the periods presented.\n9)\nREVENUES\nThe table below presents our revenues disaggregated into categories based on the nature of such revenues. See Note 19 for revenues by segment disaggregated into these categories.\nII-75\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nReceivables\nIncluded in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent receivables of $\n1.61\nbillion and $\n1.84\nbillion at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noncurrent receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term content licensing arrangements. Revenues from the licensing of content are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is generally collected over the term of the license period.\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2022 or 2021, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $\n1.06\nbillion, $\n1.20\nbillion and $\n1.12\nbillion at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognized revenues of $\n0.9\nbillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and $\n0.6\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 that were included in the opening balance of deferred revenues for the respective year.\nUnrecognized Revenues Under Contract\nAt December 31, 2022, unrecognized revenues attributable to unsatisfied performance obligations under our long-term contracts were approximately $\n9\nbillion, of which $\n4\nbillion is expected to be recognized in 2023, $\n2\nbillion in 2024, $\n1\nbillion in 2025, and $\n2\nbillion thereafter. These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts, primarily consisting of television and film licensing contracts and affiliate agreements that are subject to a fixed or guaranteed minimum fee. Such amounts change on a regular basis as we renew existing agreements or enter into new agreements. Unrecognized revenues under contracts disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of advertising contracts (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for multiple programs for which variable consideration is determined based on the value of the programs delivered to the customer and our right to invoice corresponds with the value delivered.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied in Previous Periods\nUnder certain licensing arrangements, the amount and timing of our revenue recognition is determined based on our licensees’ subsequent sale to its end customers. As a result, under such arrangements, we often satisfy our performance obligation of delivery of our content in advance of revenue recognition. We recognized revenues of $\n0.4\nbillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, from arrangements for the licensing of our content, including from distributors of transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services and other licensing arrangement, as well as from the theatrical distribution of our films, for which our performance obligation was satisfied in a prior period.\nII-76\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n10)\nDEBT\nOur debt consists of the following\n:\n(a) At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $\n442\nmillion and $\n466\nmillion, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $\n89\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $\n16.38\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and $\n18.27\nbillion at December 31, 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we redeemed senior notes totaling $\n2.39\nbillion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.49\nbillion and redeemed, at par, our $\n520\nmillion of\n5.875\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057. These redemptions resulted in a total pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n120\nmillion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued $\n1.00\nbillion of\n6.375\n% junior subordinated debentures due 2062. The interest rate on these debentures will reset on March 30, 2027, and every\nfive years\nthereafter to a fixed rate equal to the 5-year Treasury Rate (as defined pursuant to the terms of the debentures) plus a spread of\n3.999\n%\nII-77\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nfrom March 30, 2027,\n4.249\n% from March 30, 2032 and\n4.999\n% from March 30, 2047. These debentures can be called by us at par plus a make whole premium any time before March 30, 2027, or at par on March 30, 2027 or on any interest payment date thereafter.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed senior notes totaling $\n1.99\nbillion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.11\nbillion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n128\nmillion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $\n4.50\nbillion of senior notes and redeemed long-term debt totaling $\n2.77\nbillion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.88\nbillion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n126\nmillion.\nOur\n6.25\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rate until February 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate. Under the terms of the debentures the floating rate is based on three-month LIBOR plus\n3.899\n%, reset quarterly, however, with the phasing out of LIBOR and the passage of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, signed into law on March 15, 2022, it is expected that the\n6.25\n% junior subordinated debentures due 2057 will, upon switching to a floating rate, bear interest at a replacement rate based on three-month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). These debentures can be called by us at par at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period.\nThe interest rate payable on our\n3.45\n% senior notes due October 2026, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to these senior notes. The interest rate on these senior notes would increase by\n0.25\n% upon each credit agency downgrade, up to a maximum of\n2.00\n%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of these senior notes was $\n124\nmillion.\nSome of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.\nAt December 31, 2022, our scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, which excludes payments for the related interest and finance leases, were as follows:\nCommercial Paper\nAt both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had\nno\noutstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nCredit Facility\nAt December 31, 2022, we had a $\n3.50\nbillion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our\nII-78\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nsenior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. The benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen is based on EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR rates, respectively. The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than\n4.5\nx (which we may elect to increase to\n5.0\nx for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. On February 14, 2022, we amended our Credit Facility to modify the definition of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio in the amended credit agreement to allow unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness through June 2024\n.\nWe met the covenant as of December 31, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $\n3.50\nbillion.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had bank borrowings under Miramax’s $\n300\nmillion credit facility, which matures in April 2023, of $\n55\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion, respectively, with weighted average interest rates of\n7.09\n% and\n3.50\n%, respectively.\n11)\nLEASES\nLessee Contracts\nWe have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. We also have finance leases for equipment, which were not material for the periods presented. Lease costs are generally fixed, with certain contracts containing variable payments for non-lease costs based on usage and escalations in the lessors’ annual costs.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to our operating leases.\nII-79\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents our lease cost relating to our operating leases.\n(a) Includes fixed lease costs and non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) associated with long-term operating leases.\n(b) Includes costs capitalized in programming assets during the period for leased assets used in the production of programming.\n(c) Short-term leases, which are not recorded in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, have a term of 12 months or less and exclude month-to-month leases.\n(d) Primarily includes non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) and costs for equipment leases that vary based on usage.\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information for our operating leases.\nThe expected future payments relating to our operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had no material leases that were executed but not yet commenced.\nLessor Contracts\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded\ntotal lease income\nof $\n65\nmillion, $\n145\nmillion and $\n133\nmillion, respectively, which relates to operating leases of our owned production facilities and office buildings. Lease payments received under these agreements consist of fixed payments for the rental of space and certain building operating costs, as well as variable payments based on usage of production facilities and services, and escalating costs of building operations. The lower lease income for 2022 compared with prior years is the result of the sales of a production facility and an office building during the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Note 2). Accordingly, our future fixed lease income is not expected to be material.\nII-80\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n12)\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying value of our financial instruments approximates fair value, except for notes and debentures. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $\n15.78\nbillion and $\n17.66\nbillion, respectively, and the fair value, which is determined based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was $\n13.9\nbillion and $\n21.5\nbillion, respectively.\nInvestments\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021,  included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are equity-method investments of $\n375\nmillion and $\n568\nmillion, respectively, and equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which we have no significant influence of $\n70\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion, respectively.\nOur equity-method investments include a\n50\n% interest in SkyShowtime, a joint venture formed in 2022, which launched a new subscription streaming service in certain European territories, as well as interests in several international television joint ventures including a\n49\n% interest in Viacom18, a joint venture in India. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, “Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations included impairment charges of $\n34\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively, relating to television joint ventures.\nDuring September 2022, we sold a\n37.5\n% interest in The CW to Nexstar Media Inc. and received a noncash distribution of $\n139\nmillion, comprised of certain licensing receivables earned by The CW prior to the sale. This transaction, which reduced our ownership in The CW to\n12.5\n%, resulted in a loss of $\n4\nmillion, which principally consists of transaction costs. This loss, along with an impairment of an investment sold in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $\n5\nmillion, is recorded in “Net gains (losses) from investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor 2021, “Net gains from investments” of $\n47\nmillion on the Consolidated Statement of Operations primarily includes a gain of $\n37\nmillion on the sale of an investment without a readily determinable fair value and a gain of $\n9\nmillion from an increase in the fair value of a marketable security, which was sold in the third quarter of 2021. For 2020, “Net gains from investments” of $\n206\nmillion reflects a gain of $\n213\nmillion related to an increase in the value of our investment in fuboTV, Inc. which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by an impairment of investments without a readily determinable fair value of $\n7\nmillion.\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nForeign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, generally for periods up to\n24\nmonths. We designate foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $\n3.06\nbillion and $\n1.94\nbillion, respectively. For 2022, $\n2.40\nbillion related to future production costs and $\n655\nmillion\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2021, $\n1.38\nbillion related to\nII-81\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nfuture production costs and $\n564\nmillion related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nGains recognized on derivative financial instruments were as follows:\nWe continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\n13)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. All of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis use Level 2 inputs. The fair value of foreign currency hedges is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is determined based on the fair value of the investments elected by employees.\nDuring the fourth quarter 2022, we recorded an impairment charge of $\n27\nmillion to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in\ntwo\nmarkets to their estimated fair values, which were determined based on the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (Level 3). See Note 6.\n14)\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into joint ventures or make investments with business partners that support our underlying business strategy and provide us the ability to enter new markets to expand the reach of our brands, develop new programming and/or distribute our existing content. In certain instances, an entity in which we make an investment may qualify as a VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we assess whether we have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nII-82\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following tables present the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to our consolidated VIEs.\n(a) The revenue and operating income include the licensing of the streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nby a consolidated\n51\n%-owned VIE in 2020.\n15)\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nIn general, the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have the same economic rights; however, holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law. Holders of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share with respect to all matters on which the holders of the Company’s Common Stock are entitled to vote.\nStock Offerings\nOn March 26, 2021, we completed offerings of\n20\nmillion shares of our Class B Common Stock at a price to the public of $\n85\nper share and\n10\nmillion shares of\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at a price to the public and liquidation preference of $\n100\nper share. The net proceeds from the Class B Common Stock offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering were approximately $\n1.67\nbillion and $\n983\nmillion, respectively, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. As of December 31, 2022, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of $\n1\nbillion.\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\nUnless earlier converted, each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically and mandatorily convert on the mandatory conversion date, expected to be April 1, 2024, into between\n1.0013\nand\n1.1765\nshares of our Class B Common Stock, subject to customary antidilution adjustments. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion will be determined based on the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of our Class B Common Stock over the\n20\nconsecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the\n21\nst scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2024. Holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Holders”) have the right to convert all or any portion of their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at any time prior to April 1, 2024 at the minimum conversion rate of\n1.0013\nshares of our Class B Common Stock. In addition, the conversion rate applicable to such an early conversion may, in certain circumstances, be increased to compensate Holders for certain unpaid accumulated dividends. However, if a fundamental change (as defined in the Certificate of Designations governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock) occurs on or prior to April 1, 2024, then Holders will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to convert all or a portion of their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at an increased conversion rate for a specified period of time and receive an amount to compensate them for unpaid accumulated dividends and any remaining future scheduled dividend payments. In 2022, conversions of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into Class B Common Stock were minimal.\nII-83\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable. However, at our option, we may purchase or otherwise acquire (including in an exchange transaction) the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock from time to time in the open market, by tender or exchange offer or otherwise, without the consent of, or notice to, Holders. Holders have no voting rights, with certain exceptions.\nIf declared, dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are payable quarterly through April 1, 2024. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock accumulate from the most recent dividend payment date, and will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of\n5.75\n% of the liquidation preference of $\n100\nper share, payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock or through any combination of cash and shares of Class B Common Stock, at our election. If we have not declared any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends by April 1, 2024, the conversion rate will be adjusted so that Holders receive an additional number of shares of our Class B Common Stock, with certain limitations.\nDividends\nWe declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020. During each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we declared total per share dividends of $\n.96\n, resulting in total annual dividends of $\n635\nmillion, $\n625\nmillion and $\n601\nmillion, respectively.\nDuring each of the quarters of 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n1.4375\nper share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, resulting in total annual dividends of $\n58\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded total annual dividends on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $\n44\nmillion. During each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of\n1.4375\nper share. During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $\n1.5493\nper share, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021.\nTreasury Stock\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $\n2.36\nbillion of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. During 2022, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. During 2020, we repurchased\n1.3\nmillion shares of our Class B Common Stock under our share repurchase program for $\n50\nmillion, at an average cost of $\n38.63\nper share.\nCommon Stock Conversion Rights\nHolders of Class A Common Stock have the right to convert their shares to Class B Common Stock as long as there are at least\n5,000\nshares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. In 2022 and 2020, conversions of Class A Common Stock into Class B Common Stock were minimal. In 2021, conversions of Class A Common Stock into Class B Common Stock were\n11.6\nmillion.\nII-84\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a) Reflects cumulative translation adjustments.\n(b) Reflects amortization of net actuarial losses, which for 2021 includes the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans, and amortization of prior service cost (see Note 18).\nThe net actuarial loss and prior service cost related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans included in other comprehensive income (loss) is net of a tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 of $\n108\nmillion, $\n25\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively.\n16)\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have long-term equity-based incentive plans (the “Plans”) under which stock options, RSUs and PSUs are issued. The purpose of the Plans is to benefit and advance the interests of our company by attracting, retaining and motivating participants and to compensate participants for their contributions to the financial success of our company. The Plans provide for awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalents, performance awards and other equity-related awards. RSUs and PSUs accrue dividends each time we declare a quarterly cash dividend, which are paid upon vesting when the shares are delivered and are forfeited if the award does not vest. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs, we issue new shares from our existing authorization. At December 31, 2022, there were\n32\nmillion shares available for future grant under the Plans. Stock-based compensation awards were also granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans until December 31, 2021. Upon exercise of outstanding stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs previously granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans, shares may be issued from Viacom’s previous authorization or from treasury stock.\nII-85\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n(a) Reflects accelerations as a result of restructuring activities.\nIncluded in net earnings from discontinued operations was stock-based compensation expense of $\n3\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and $\n10\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRSUs and PSUs\nCompensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which is generally a\none\n- to\nfour-year\nservice period.   Forfeitures for RSUs are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates and adjusted based on actual forfeitures. On an annual basis, we revise the estimated forfeiture rate, as necessary.\nFor PSU awards the number of shares to be issued upon vesting is based on the total shareholder return of the Company’s Class B Common Stock measured against the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index over a designated measurement period, and for certain 2022 and 2021 awards is also based on the achievement of established operating goals. The fair value of PSU awards with a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, and is expensed over the required employee service period. Compensation expense for PSUs is not adjusted for the actual number of shares issued based on the outcome of the market condition for completed performance periods. The fair value of PSU awards with internal performance conditions is based on the market price of the shares on the date of grant, and is expensed based on the probable outcome of internal  performance metrics and subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual shares issued based on the outcome of the performance metrics for completed performance periods. Compensation expense is adjusted for non-performance based forfeitures for all PSU awards. The fair value of PSU awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n43\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion, respectively.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted was $\n31.58\n,\n$\n35.80\nand $\n32.35\nin 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The total market value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $\n77\nmillion, $\n260\nmillion and $\n222\nmillion, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs and PSUs at December 31, 2022 was $\n244\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.46\nyears.\nII-86\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes our RSU and PSU share activity:\nStock Options\nCompensation expense for stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award calculated using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Stock options generally vest over a\nthree\n- to\nfour-year\nservice period and expire\neight years\nfrom the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. We adjust the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures.\nThere were\nno\nstock option grants during any of the periods presented.\nAt December 31, 2022, all stock options are vested and there is no remaining unrecognized compensation cost.\nThe following table summarizes our stock option activity under the Plans.\nThe following table summarizes other information relating to stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. There were no stock option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAt December 31, 2022, stock options outstanding and exercisable have a weighted average remaining contractual life of\n2.06\nyears. There was\nno\nintrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable, based on our closing stock price of $\n16.88\nat December 31, 2022.\nII-87\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n17)\nINCOME TAXES\nThe U.S. and foreign components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies were as follows:\nThe components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes were as follows:\nIn addition, included in net earnings from discontinued operations was an income tax provision of $\n77\nmillion, $\n57\nmillion and $\n38\nmillion for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe equity in loss of investee companies is shown net of tax on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The tax benefit relating to losses from equity investments was $\n33\nmillion in 2022, $\n49\nmillion in 2021 and $\n19\nmillion in 2020, which represented an effective tax rate of\n13.9\n%,\n35.0\n% and\n40.4\n% for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nII-88\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe difference between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the provision (benefit) for income taxes is summarized as follows:\n(a) For 2022, reflects a deferred tax benefit resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. The related deferred tax asset is primarily expected to be realized over a\n25-year\nperiod. For 2021, reflects a tax benefit from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary.\nThe following table summarizes the components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to the amounts reflected in the table above, included in “Assets of discontinued operations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are net deferred income tax assets of $\n55\nmillion and $\n80\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had deferred income tax assets for federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n43\nmillion and net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions of $\n261\nmillion,\nII-89\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe majority of which expire in various years from 2023 through 2038. The deferred tax asset for the federal interest limitation carryforward of $\n93\nmillion at December 31, 2022 has an indefinite carryforward period.\nThe 2022 and 2021 deferred income tax assets were reduced by a valuation allowance of $\n488\nmillion and $\n581\nmillion, respectively, principally relating to income tax benefits from capital losses and net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions which are not expected to be realized.\nGenerally, the future remittance of foreign undistributed earnings will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes and as a result, for substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries, we do not intend to assert indefinite reinvestment of both cash held outside of the U.S. and future cash earnings. However, a future repatriation of cash could be subject to state and local income taxes, foreign income taxes, tax on foreign currency translation gains and losses, and withholding taxes. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities associated with future repatriations of $\n13\nmillion on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additional income taxes have not been provided for outside basis differences inherent in these entities, which could be recognized upon sale or other transaction, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely invested in foreign operations. The determination of the U.S. federal deferred income tax liability for such outside basis difference is not practicable.\nThe following table sets forth the change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding related accrued interest and penalties.\nThe reserve for uncertain tax positions of $\n303\nmillion at December 31, 2022 includes $\n272\nmillion which would affect our effective income tax rate, including discontinued operations, if and when recognized in future years. We recognized interest and penalties of $\n14\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and $\n16\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recorded liabilities for accrued interest and penalties of $\n67\nmillion and $\n56\nmillion, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nII-90\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nViacom and CBS filed separate tax returns for periods prior to the Merger. For CBS, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. For Viacom, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. For tax returns filed as a merged company, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2019 tax year. Various tax years are also currently under examination by state and local and foreign tax authorities. With respect to open tax years in all jurisdictions, we currently do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions will significantly change within the next 12 months; however, it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter and events could cause our current expectation to change in the future.\n18)\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, principally non-contributory, covering eligible employees. Our pension plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans. The majority of participants in these plans are retired employees or former employees of previously divested businesses. In November 2020, our remaining defined benefit pension plans subject to benefit accruals, which were sponsored by CBS prior to the Merger, were amended to freeze future benefit accruals and benefits were enhanced under defined contribution plans that were previously sponsored by CBS, both of which were effective January 1, 2021. As a result of the pension plan amendments, a curtailment gain of $\n79\nmillion associated with the elimination of benefit accruals for future services of the impacted employees was reflected in unrecognized actuarial loss included within “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2020. Plan benefits  are based primarily on an employee’s years of service and  pay for each year that the employee participated in the plan. We fund our pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other applicable law, rules and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of corporate bonds, equity securities, common collective trust funds, U.S. government securities and short-term investments. The Company’s Common Stock represented approximately\n1.2\n% and\n1.5\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company sponsors health and welfare plans that provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees and their covered dependents. Eligibility is based in part on certain age and service requirements at the time of their retirement. Most of the plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually, as well as caps on the annual dollar amount we will contribute toward the cost of coverage. Claims and premiums for which we are responsible are paid with our own funds.\nThe pension plan disclosures herein include information related to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans only, unless otherwise noted. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Consolidated Balance Sheets also include a liability of $\n45\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion, respectively, in “Pension and postretirement benefit obligations” relating to our non-U.S. pension plans and certain other retirement severance plans.\nWe use a December 31 measurement date for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nII-91\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table sets forth the change in benefit obligation for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe actuarial gain of $\n1.09\nbillion, included in the change in benefit obligation for pension benefits in 2022, was driven by a\n270\nbasis point increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth the change in plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe funded status of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nOur qualified pension plans were underfunded by $\n485\nmillion and $\n655\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nII-92\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following amounts were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n3.66\nbillion and $\n4.91\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInformation for the pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets is set forth below.\nThe following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\n(b) Includes amounts reflected in net earnings from discontinued operations of $\n3\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and $\n5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020\n.\nThe service cost component of net periodic cost is presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within operating income. All other components of net periodic cost are presented below operating income, in “Other items, net.”\nII-93\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nN/A - not applicable\nThe discount rates are determined primarily based on the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds, providing cash flows necessary to meet the pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets.\nThe following additional assumptions were used in accounting for postretirement benefits.\nII-94\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nPlan Assets\nThe Paramount Global Investments Committee (the “Committee”) determines the strategy for the investment of pension plan assets. The Committee establishes target asset allocations for our pension plan trusts based upon an analysis of the timing and amount of projected benefit payments, projected company contributions, the expected returns and risk of the asset classes and the correlation of those returns. The target asset allocation for the Company’s domestic pension plans is to invest between\n60\n% -\n68\n% in liability hedging assets,\n22\n% -\n30\n% in equity securities,\n3\n% -\n10\n% in real estate and real assets and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents, Paramount stock and other investments. At December 31, 2022, the trusts were invested approximately\n63\n% in liability hedging assets,\n29\n% in equity securities,\n6\n% in real estate and real assets, and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents, Paramount stock and other investments. Liability hedging assets consist of a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments that are substantially investment grade, with a duration that approximates the duration of the liabilities covered by the trust. All equity portfolios are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. equities and include large and small capitalization equities. The asset allocations are reviewed regularly.\nThe following tables set forth our pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These assets have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. See Note 13 for a description of the levels within this hierarchy. There are no investments categorized as Level 3.\nII-95\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a)  Assets categorized as Level 2 reflect investments in money market funds.\n(b) On January 3, 2022, the trust that held the assets of the Viacom pension plan was merged into the trust that holds the assets of the remainder of the Company’s' domestic plans. As part of this merger, certain of the transferred assets were liquidated, which resulted in a higher level of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021.\n(c)  Securities of diverse sectors and industries, substantially all investment grade.\n(d)  In accordance with FASB guidance, investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(e)  Underlying investments consist mainly of U.S. large capitalization and international equity securities.\nMoney market investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges. The fair value of investments in common collective funds and mutual funds is determined using the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined by each fund’s trustee based upon the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding units. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of government related securities and corporate bonds is determined based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges, when available, or using valuation models which incorporate certain other observable inputs including recent trading activity for comparable securities and broker quoted prices. The fair value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is based upon valuation models which incorporate available dealer quotes, projected cash flows and market information. The fair value of limited partnerships has been estimated using the NAV of the ownership interest. The NAV is determined using quarterly financial statements issued by the partnership which determine the value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.\nII-96\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFuture Benefit Payments\nEstimated future benefit payments are as follows:\nIn 2023, we expect to make $\n8\nmillion in contributions to our qualified pension plans for minimum funding requirements under ERISA and $\n75\nmillion to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $\n35\nmillion to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans.\nMultiemployer Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees including talent, writers, directors, producers and other employees, primarily in the entertainment industry. The other employers participating in these multiemployer plans are primarily in the entertainment and other related industries. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans as assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if we choose to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.\nThe financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Plans in the red zone are in critical status; those in the yellow zone are in endangered status; and those in the green zone are neither critical nor endangered.\nThe table below presents information concerning our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.\n(a) The zone status for each individual plan listed was certified by each plan’s actuary as of the beginning of the plan years for 2022 and 2021. The plan year is the twelve months ending December 31 for each plan listed above except AFTRA Retirement Plan which has a plan year ending November 30.\n(b) The Company was listed in these plan’s most recent Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of total contributions for the plan.\n(c) The expiration dates range from January 15, 2022 through December 1, 2024.\nII-97\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAs a result of the above noted zone status there were no funding improvements or rehabilitation plans implemented, as defined by ERISA, nor any surcharges imposed for any of the individual plans listed.\nWe also contribute to multiemployer plans that provide postretirement healthcare and other benefits to certain employees under collective bargaining agreements. The contributions to these plans were $\n192\nmillion, $\n184\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognize the net periodic cost for multiemployer pension and postretirement benefit plans based on the required contributions to the plans.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor defined contribution plans for the benefit of substantially all employees meeting eligibility requirements. Employer contributions to such plans were $\n137\nmillion, $\n106\nmillion and $\n91\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n19)\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe tables below set forth our financial information by reportable segment. Our operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments, have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is organized based upon products and services.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer streaming businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that resulted in the changes described below. Prior period results have been recast to conform to these presentation changes.\nManagement Structure Change\nOur management structure was reorganized to focus on managing our business as the combination of three parts: a traditional media business, a portfolio of domestic and international streaming services, and a film studio. As a result, we realigned our operating segments and accordingly, beginning in 2022, and for all periods presented we are reporting results based on the segments in the tables below (see Note 1 for a description of each operating segment).\nIntercompany License Fees\nConcurrent with the change to our operating segments, we changed the way we record intersegment content licensing. Under our previous segment structure, management evaluated the results of our segments including intersegment content licensing at market value as if the sales were to third parties. Therefore, the licensor segment recorded intercompany license fee revenues and profits and the licensee segment recorded production costs in the amount of the license fee charged by the licensor, which generally reflected the cost to the Company plus a margin. The intercompany revenues and the margin embedded in the cost to the licensee were eliminated in consolidation.\nII-98\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nUnder our new segment structure, management evaluates the results of the segments using an allocation of the total cost of content from the licensor segment to each licensee segment utilizing the content. As a result, content costs are allocated across segments based on the relative value of the distribution windows within each segment. The allocation is recorded by the licensor segment as a reduction of content cost and no intersegment licensing revenues or profits are recorded.\nRevenues generated between segments are principally from intersegment arrangements for the distribution of content, rental of studio space, and advertising, as well as licensing revenues earned from third parties who license our content to our internal platforms either through a sub-license or co-production arrangement. These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation.\nII-99\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and net gain on dispositions, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management.\n(a) Revenue classifications are based on customers’ locations.\n(a) Reflects total assets less current assets, investments, goodwill, intangible assets, noncurrent receivables and noncurrent deferred tax assets.\nWe do not disclose our assets by segment because they are not used to evaluate our operating performance or in determining the allocation of resources.\nII-100\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n20)\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nOur commitments not recorded on the balance sheet primarily consist of programming and talent commitments and purchase obligations for goods and services resulting from our normal course of business.\nOur programming and talent commitments, estimated to aggregate to $\n33.73\nbillion as of December 31, 2022, include $\n29.50\nbillion for sports programming rights and $\n4.23\nbillion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, including talent contracts. We also have committed purchase obligations which include agreements to purchase goods or services in the future that totaled $\n1.73\nbillion as of December 31, 2022.\nOther long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet include program liabilities, participations, residuals, and a tax liability resulting from federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the remaining tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2024 and 2025.\nAt December 31, 2022, commitments for programming and talent and purchase obligations not recorded on the balance sheet, and other long-term contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet were payable as follows:\nWe also have long-term lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022. See Note 11 for details of our operating lease commitments.\nGuarantees\nLetters of Credit and Surety Bonds.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $\n178\nmillion that were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Letters of credit and surety bonds are primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business.\nCBS Television City\n.  In connection with the sale of CBS Television City property and sound stage operation (“CBS Television City”) in 2019, we guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first\nfive years\nfollowing the completion of the sale. Included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 is a liability totaling $\n51\nmillion, reflecting the present value of the remaining estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.\nII-101\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLease Guarantees.\nWe have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players. These lease commitments totaled $\n20\nmillion at December 31, 2022, and are presented within “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of lease commitments varies over time depending on the expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.\nIn the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “Litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStockholder Matters\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning in February 2020,\nthree\npurported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. In March 2020, the Court consolidated the\nthree\nlawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees’ Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. In April 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, members of the CBS Board of Directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13, 2019, between CBS and Viacom (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with Mr. Ianniello’s compensation. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In June 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. In January 2021, the Court dismissed\none\ndisclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. In December 2022, the Court dismissed the fiduciary duty claim against Mr. Klieger. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. A six-day trial is scheduled to begin in June 2023. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nII-102\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nBeginning in November 2019,\nfour\npurported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. In January 2020, the Court consolidated the\nfour\nlawsuits. In February 2020, the Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. Subsequently, in February 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. In May 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. In December 2020, the Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. A six-day trial is scheduled to begin in July 2023. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nInvestigation-Related Matters\nAs announced in August 2018, the CBS Board of Directors retained\ntwo\nlaw firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. In December 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board of Directors’ determination with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment.\nIn August 2018 and in October 2018, Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. In November 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. Subsequently, in November 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. In February 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board of Directors. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. In April 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part in January 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We reached an agreement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit for $\n14.75\nmillion, which was paid by our insurers. The settlement, which includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, was granted final approval by the Court in November 2022.\nWe also received subpoenas or requests for information from the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, the New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) regarding the subject matter of the CBS Board of Directors’ investigation and related matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. In November 2022, we entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance with the Investor Protection Bureau of the New\nII-103\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nYork State Attorney General’s Office to resolve that matter. After credits for the settlement amount to be paid in the consolidated federal securities class action discussed above, and certain financial commitments to human resources-related programs made by CBS in connection with an earlier resolution with the Civil Rights Bureau of the New York State Attorney General’s Office, the Company has made a payment of $\n7.25\nmillion, which by agreement with the Investor Protection Bureau will be distributed in connection with the federal securities class action settlement discussed above. The resolution with the Investor Protection Bureau includes no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company. In December 2022, we received a termination letter from the SEC, indicating that it does not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Company. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future.\nLitigation Related to Stock Offerings\nIn August 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and in November 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”). The Complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. In December 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were heard in January 2023. On February 7, 2023, the Court dismissed all claims against the Company while allowing the claims against the underwriters to proceed.\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owners\nIn September 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning about January 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among\nfourteen\ntotal defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. In October 2019, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the Court in November 2020. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to Court approval.\nLitigation Related to the Proposed Sale of Simon & Schuster\nIn November 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block our sale of the Simon & Schuster business to Penguin Random House pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated November 24, 2020, between the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, Penguin Random House and Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. In October 2022, following a bench trial, the Court blocked the sale. In November 2022, we terminated the Purchase Agreement and subsequently received a $\n200\nmillion termination fee.\nII-104\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nClaims Related to Former Businesses\nAsbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2022, we had pending approximately\n21,580\nasbestos claims, as compared with approximately\n27,770\nas of December 31, 2021 and\n30,710\nas of December 31, 2020. During 2022, we received approximately\n2,840\nnew claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately\n9,030\nclaims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2022 and 2021 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $\n57\nmillion and $\n63\nmillion, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods, and as a result our actual liabilities may be higher or lower than our accrual.\nOther\nFrom time to time, we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.\nII-105\nPARAMOUNT GLOBAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n21)\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nOn October 31, 2022 we acquired the remaining\n40\n% interest in Nickelodeon UK Limited (“Nick UK”), bringing our ownership to\n100\n%.
