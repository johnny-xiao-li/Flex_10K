    "text": "General\nHenry Schein, Inc. is a solutions company for health care professionals powered\nby a network of people and\ntechnology.\nWe believe we are the world’s largest\nprovider of health care products and services primarily to\noffice-\nbased dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care.\nOur philosophy is grounded in our\ncommitment to help customers operate a more efficient and successful business so\nthe practitioner can provide\nbetter clinical care.\nWith more than 90 years of experience distributing health care products, we have built a vast set of small,\nmid-sized\nand large customers in the dental and medical markets, serving more than one million\ncustomers worldwide across\ndental practices, laboratories,\nphysician practices, and ambulatory surgery centers, as well as government,\ninstitutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.\nWe are headquartered in Melville, New York\nand employ more than 22,000 people.\nApproximately 50% of our\nworkforce is based in the United States and approximately 50% is based\noutside of the United States.\nWe have\noperations or affiliates in 32 countries and territories.\nOur broad global footprint has evolved over time through our\norganic success as well as through contribution from strategic acquisitions.\nWe offer\na comprehensive selection of more than 300,000 branded products\nand Henry Schein corporate brand\nproducts through our distribution centers.\nOur infrastructure, including over 3.8 million square\nfeet of space in 29\nstrategically located distribution and 19 manufacturing facilities around\nthe world, enables us to historically provide\nrapid and accurate order fulfillment, better serve our customers and increase\nour operating efficiency.\nThis\ninfrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices,\nand a strong commitment to\ncustomer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’\nneeds.\nWe conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and\nvalue-added services.\nThese segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.\nOur dental\nbusinesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools, government\nand other\ninstitutions.\nOur medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent care centers, ambulatory care sites,\nemergency\nmedical technicians, dialysis centers, home health, federal and state governments\nand large enterprises, such as\ngroup practices\nand integrated delivery networks, among other providers across a\nwide range of specialties.\nThe health care distribution reportable segment, combining our global dental\nand medical businesses, distributes\nconsumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment\nrepair services, branded\nand generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, dental specialty products\n(including implant, orthodontic\nand endodontic products), diagnostic tests, infection-control products, personal\nprotective equipment products\n(“PPE”) and vitamins.\nWhile our primary go-to-market strategy is in our capacity\nas a distributor, we also market\nand sell under our own corporate brand portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable\nmerchandise products,\nand manufacture certain dental specialty products in the areas of oral\nsurgery, implants, orthodontics and\nendodontics.\nThe technology and value-added services reportable segment provides\nsoftware, technology and other value-added\nservices to health care practitioners.\nHenry Schein One, the largest contributor of sales to this category, offers\ndental practice management solutions for dental and medical practitioners.\nIn addition, we offer dentists and\nphysicians a broad suite of electronic health records, patient communication\nservices including electronic marketing\nand web-site design, analytics and patient demand generation.\nFinally, our value-added practice solutions include\npractice consultancy, education, integrated revenue cycle management and the facilitation of financial service\nofferings (on a non-recourse basis) to help dentists and physicians operate and\nexpand their business operations.\nWe believe our hands-on consultative approach to provide solutions to support practice decision-making is a key\ndifferentiator for our business.\n4\nRecent Developments\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent\nDevelopments” herein for a discussion related to the COVID-19\npandemic and recent corporate transactions.\nIndustry\nThe global health care distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and\ndiverse.\nThe industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of\nrelatively small offices to mid-sized and large\ngroup practices ranging in size from a few practitioners to several\nhundred practices owned or operated by dental\nsupport organizations (DSOs), medical group purchasing organizations (GPOs), hospital systems\nor integrated\ndelivery networks (IDNs).\nDue in part to the limited capacity of office-based health care practitioners\nto store and manage large quantities of\nsupplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment\nto office-based health care\npractitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders,\nand a need for rapid, reliable and\nsubstantially complete order fulfillment.\nThe purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice\nare\ntypically made by the practitioner, hygienist or office manager.\nSupplies and small equipment are generally\npurchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.\nThe health care distribution industry continues to experience growth due\nto demand driven by the aging population,\nincreased health care awareness and the importance of preventative care,\nan increasing understanding of the\nconnection between good oral health and overall health, improved access\nto care globally, the proliferation of\nmedical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and\nexpanded third-party insurance coverage,\npartially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage and technological\nimprovements, including\nthe advancement of software and services, prosthetic solutions and\ntelemedicine.\nIn addition, the non-acute market\ncontinues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic\ntesting from acute care settings to alternate-care\nsites, particularly physicians’ offices and ambulatory surgery centers.\nWe believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly\nthose with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking\nto combine with larger companies that can\nprovide growth\nopportunities.\nThis consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking\nto acquire\ncompanies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide\nopportunities to serve a broader\ncustomer base.\nIn addition, customer consolidation will likely lead to multiple locations\nunder common management and the\nmovement of more procedures from the hospital setting to the physician\nor alternate care setting as the health care\nindustry is increasingly focused on efficiency and cost containment.\nThis trend has benefited distributors capable\nof providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.\nIt also has accelerated the growth of health\nmaintenance organizations (“HMOs”), group practices, other managed care accounts\nand collective buying groups,\nwhich, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive\nprices, tend to favor distributors capable\nof providing specialized management information support.\nWe believe that the trend towards cost containment has\nthe potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software,\nwhich can enhance the\nefficiency and facilitation of practice management.\nCompetition\nThe distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is\nhighly competitive.\nMany of the health\ncare products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.\nIn addition, our competitors could\nobtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.\nManufacturers also could seek to sell\ndirectly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and\nthat of other distributors.\nIn certain parts of the\ndental end market, such as those related to dental specialty products, and\nmedical end market manufacturers already\nsell directly to end customers.\nIn North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several\nmanufacturers, of dental and medical\nproducts, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, e-commerce\ncapabilities, customer service and\n5\nvalue-added products and services.\nIn the dental market, our primary competitors in the U.S. are the Patterson\nDental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply\nCompany.\nIn addition, we compete against\na number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and\nlocal level.\nOur primary competitors in the\nU.S. medical market, which accounts for the large majority of our global medical\nsales, are McKesson Corporation\nand Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors.\nWe also compete with a number of regional and local\nmedical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that\nsell directly to physicians.\nWith regard to our dental\nsoftware, we compete against numerous companies, including the\nPatterson Dental division of Patterson\nCompanies, Inc., Carestream Health, Inc., Carestream Dental LLC, Centaur\nSoftware Development Co Pty Ltd.\n(d.b.a. dental4windows, dental4web), Open Dental Software, Inc., PlanetDDS\nLLC, Good Methods Global Inc.\n(d.b.a. CareStack) and Curve Dental, LLC.\nIn other software end markets, including revenue cycle\nmanagement,\npatient relationship management and patient demand generation, we\ncompete with companies such as Vyne\nTherapeutics Inc., EDI-Health Group, Inc. (d.b.a. Dental X Change, Inc.),\nWeave Communications, Inc., and\nSolutionreach, Inc.\nThe medical practice management and electronic medical\nrecords market is fragmented and we\ncompete with numerous companies such as the NextGen division of\nQuality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks,\nAllscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Epic Systems Corporation.\nOutside of the U.S., we believe we are the only global distributor of supplies\nand equipment to dental practices and\nour competitors are primarily local and regional companies.\nWe also face significant competition internationally,\nwhere we compete on the basis of price and customer service against\nseveral large competitors, including the\nGACD Group, Proclinic SA, Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy and Billericay Dental\nSupply Co. Ltd., as well as a large\nnumber of other dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers\nin international countries and territories\nwe serve.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe have more than 90 years of experience in distributing products to health care practitioners resulting in strong\nawareness of the Henry Schein\n®\nbrand.\nOur competitive strengths include:\nA focus on meeting our customers’ unique needs\n.\nWe are committed to providing customized solutions to our\ncustomers that are driven by our understanding of the end markets we\nserve and reflect the

well as through the acquisition\nof new\nproducts and services that may help us better serve our customers.\nDirect sales and marketing expertise.\nOur sales and marketing efforts are designed to

an engaging\npurchase experience, supported by excellent customer service.\n•\nSocial media.\nOur operating entities and employees engage our customers and\nsupplier partners through\nvarious social media platforms, which are an important element of our\ncommunications and marketing\nefforts.\nWe continue to expand our social media presence to raise awareness about issues, engage\ncustomers beyond a sale and deliver services and solutions to specialized\naudiences.\nBroad product and service offerings at competitive prices.\nWe offer\na broad range of products and services to our\ncustomers, at competitive prices, in the following categories:\n•\nConsumable supplies and equipment\n.\nWe distribute consumable products, small equipment, laboratory\nproducts, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals,\nvaccines, dental\nspecialty products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.\nWe offer over 300,000 branded\nproducts, through our distribution centers, to our customers.\nWe also market and sell our own corporate\nbrand portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable merchandise products\nand manufacture certain\ndental specialty products in the areas of implants, orthodontics and endodontics.\n•\nTechnology and other value-added products and services.\nWe sell practice management, business\nanalytics, patient engagement and patient demand creation software solutions\nto our dental customers.\nOur\npractice management solutions provide practitioners with electronic\nmedical records, patient treatment\nhistory, analytics, billing, accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars, electronic\nclaims processing and word processing programs, network and hardware\nservices, e-commerce and\nelectronic marketing services, sourcing third party patient payment plans,\ntransition services and training\nand education programs for practitioners.\nWe also sell medical software for practice management, certified\nelectronic health records (“EHR”) and e-Prescribe medications and prescription\nsolutions through\nMicroMD®.\nWe have technical representatives supporting customers using our practice management\nsolutions and services.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had an active user base of approximately\n110,000\npractices and 380,000 consumers, including users of AxiUm, Dentally®, Dentrix\nAscend®, Dental\nVision®, Dentrix® Dental Systems, Dentrix® Enterprise, Easy Dental®, EndoVision®, Evolution® and\nEXACT®, Gesden®, Jarvis

variety of\nrepair, installation and technical services for our health care customers.\nOur technicians provide\ninstallation and repair services for: dental handpieces,\ndental and medical small equipment,\ntable-top\nsterilizers and large dental equipment.\n•\nFinancial services.\nWe offer our customers solutions in operating their practices more efficiently by\nproviding access to a number of financial services and products\nprovided by third party suppliers (including\nnon-recourse financing for equipment, technology and software\nproducts, non-recourse practice financing\nfor leasehold improvements, business debt consolidation and commercial\nreal estate, non-recourse patient\nfinancing and credit card processing) at rates that we believe are\ngenerally lower than what our customers\nwould be able to secure independently.\nWe also provide staffing services, dental practice valuation and\nbrokerage services.\nCommitment to superior customer service\n.\nWe maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer\nservice.\nWe frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical\nreports.\nOur customer service policy primarily focuses on:\n7\n•\nExceptional order fulfillment\n.\nWe ship an average of approximately 157,000 cartons daily.\nHistorically,\napproximately 99% of items have been shipped without back-ordering and were\nshipped on the same\nbusiness day the order is received.\nDue to supply chain disruptions during the year ended December\n31,\n2022, approximately 96% of items ordered were shipped without back-ordering.\nAs supply chains continue\nto stabilize, we expect our percentage of items shipped without back-ordering and\nshipped on the same day\nto return to historical levels.\n•\nComprehensive ordering process\n.\nCustomers may place orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via e-\ncommerce solutions, telephone, fax, e-mail and mail.\nIntegrated management information systems\n.\nCertain of our information systems generally allow for centralized\nmanagement of key functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing,\nsales, order fulfillment and financial and operational reporting.\nThese systems allow us to manage our growth,\ndeliver superior customer service, properly target customers, manage financial\nperformance and monitor daily\noperational statistics.\nCost-effective purchasing\n.\nWe believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing\nour position as a competitively priced provider of health care products.\nWe continuously evaluate our purchase\nrequirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the\nlowest possible cost.\nIn 2022,\nour top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately\n28% and\n4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.\nEfficient distribution\n.\nWe distribute our products from our 29 strategically located distribution centers.\nWe strive\nto maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand\nfor prompt delivery and complete order\nfulfillment.\nThese inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with\nthe aid of our management information\nsystems.\nOnce an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution\ncenter nearest the customer’s\nlocation for order fulfillment.\nProducts and Services\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales\nby principal categories of products and\nservices offered through our health care distribution and technology and value-added services\nreportable segments:\nDecember 31,\nDecember 25,\nDecember 26,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nHealth

innovative, integrated health care products and\nservices; and to be trusted advisors and\nconsultants to our customers - enabling them to deliver the best quality patient\ncare and enhance their practice\nmanagement efficiency and profitability.\nOur BOLD+1 Strategic Plan consists of the following:\n•\nBuild (“B”)\nComplementary software, specialty, and services businesses for high growth\n•\nOperationalize (“O”)\nOne Distribution to deliver exceptional customer experience, increased\nefficiency,\nand growth\n•\nLeverage (“L”)\nOne Schein to broaden and deepen relationships with our customers\n•\nDrive (“D”)\nDrive digital transformation for our customers and for Henry Schein\n•\n+1\nCreate Value\nfor our stakeholders\nTo accomplish this, we apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:\n•\nIncrease penetration of our existing customer base.\nWe have over 1 million customers worldwide and we\nintend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position\nas their primary supplier.\nWe believe our offering of a broad range of products, services and support, including software solutions\nthat can help drive improved workflow efficiency and patient communications for\npractices, coupled with\nour full-service value proposition, helps us to retain and grow our customer\nbase.\n•\nIncrease the number of customers we serve.\nThis strategy includes increasing the productivity of our field\nsales consultants and telesales team, as well as using our customer\ndatabase to focus our marketing efforts\nin all of our operating segments.\nIn the dental business, we provide products and services to\nindependent\npractices, mid-market groups, and large DSOs as well as community health centers and government\nsites of\ncare.\nLeveraging our broad array of assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these\nnew\nmarkets.\nIn the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers\nlocated in settings outside of the\ntraditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail, occupational health and home health settings.\nAs\nsettings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners\nand providing them with\nthe products and services they need.\n•\nLeverage our value-added products and services.\nWe continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key\nproduct lines utilizing a consultative selling process.\nIn the dental business, we have significant cross-\nselling opportunities between our dental software users and our dental customers.\nIn the medical business,\nwe have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals\nsales to health care\npractitioners, as well as cross-selling EHR systems and software\nwhen we sell our core products.\nOur\nstrategy extends to providing health systems, integrated delivery networks\nand other large group and multi-\nsite health care organizations, including physician clinics, these same value added\nproducts and services.\nAs physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased\naccess to opportunities for cross-\nmarketing and selling our product and service portfolios.\n•\nPursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.\nOur acquisition strategy is focused on investments in\ncompanies that add new customers and sales teams, increase our geographic\nfootprint (whether entering a\nnew country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we have already invested in businesses),\nand finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies.\nMarkets Served\nDemographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an\naging U.S. population is increasingly using health\ncare services.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, between 2022 and 2032, the 45 and\nolder population is expected to grow by approximately 11%.\nBetween 2022 and 2042, this age group is expected to\ngrow by approximately 21%.\nThis compares with expected total U.S. population growth\nrates of approximately 6%\nbetween 2022 and 2032 and approximately 12% between 2022 and 2042.\nIn the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45-and-older segment of\nthe population increases.\nThere is increasing demand for new technologies that allow\ndentists to increase\n9\nproductivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates.\nAt the same time, there is\nan expected increase in dental insurance coverage.\nIn the medical market, there continues to be a migration of procedures from\nacute-care settings to physicians’\noffices and home health settings,\na trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us.\nThere also is the\ncontinuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care\nsettings.\nWe believe we have\nestablished a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician\npractitioner.\nWe support our dental and medical professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through\nimportant value-added services, including practice management software,\nelectronic claims processing, financial\nservices and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency.\nAdditionally, we seek to expand our dental full-service model and medical offerings in countries where\nopportunities exist.\nWe do this through both direct sales and by partnering with local distribution and\nmanufacturing companies.\nFor information on revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see\nof “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nSeasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.\nAs a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of\nsecurities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price\nto decline.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.\nSales and profitability generally have been\nhigher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal\nproducts (including influenza vaccine)\npurchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners for certain products (including\nequipment and\nsoftware) and year-end promotions.\nSales and profitability may also be impacted by the timing of\ncertain annual\nand biennial dental tradeshows where equipment promotions are offered.\nIn addition, some dental practices delay\nequipment purchases in the U.S. until year-end due to tax incentives.\nWe expect our historical seasonality of sales\nto continue in the foreseeable future.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe\nstrive to be compliant in all material respects with the applicable\nlaws, regulations and guidance described\nbelow, and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial\ncompliance.\nHowever, compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future, as certain laws, regulations and\nguidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could\naffect our ability to comply, as well as\nfuture changes, additions and enforcement approaches, including political changes.\nWhen we discover situations of\nnon-compliance we seek to remedy them and bring the affected area back into compliance.\nPresident Biden’s\nadministration (the “Biden Administration”) has indicated that it will be\nmore aggressive in its pursuit of alleged\nviolations of law, and has revoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal agency\nguidance to pursue potential violations, and has stated that it is more prepared\nto pursue individuals for corporate\nlaw violations, including an aggressive approach to anti-corruption activities.\nChanges to applicable laws,\nregulations and guidance described below, as well as related administrative or judicial interpretations, may require\nus to update or revise our operations, services, marketing practices and\ncompliance programs and controls, and may\nimpose additional and unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial\nrisks to us, or may otherwise have\na material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment\nCertain of our businesses involve the distribution, manufacturing, importation,\nexportation, marketing and sale of,\nand/or third party payment for, pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices, and in this regard, we are subject\nto\nextensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations,\nincluding as applicable to our\nwholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, manufacturing\nactivities, and as part of our\nspecialty home medical supply business that distributes and sells medical equipment\nand supplies directly to\n10\npatients.\nFederal, state and certain foreign governments have also increased enforcement\nactivity in the health care\nsector, particularly in areas of fraud and abuse, anti-bribery and corruption, controlled substances handling,\nmedical\ndevice regulations and data privacy and security standards.\nGovernment and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care,\nand there have\nbeen efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs, including efforts, thus far\nunsuccessful, to\nseek repeal of the entire United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\nas amended by the Health Care\nand Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010 (as amended,\nthe “ACA”).\nIn addition, activities to\ncontrol medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement\nrates for pharmaceuticals, medical\ndevices and/or medical treatments or services, are ongoing.\nMany of these laws and regulations are subject to\nchange and their evolving implementation may impact our operations and our\nfinancial performance.\nOur businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could\nimpact our financial performance,\nand failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nOperating, Security and Licensure Standards\nCertain of our businesses are subject to local, state and federal governmental\nlaws and regulations relating to the\ndistribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and supplies.\nAmong the United States federal laws applicable\nto us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDC Act”),\nSection 361 of the Public Health Service Act and Section 401 of the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act of the Social\nSecurity Act, as well as laws regulating the billing of and reimbursement\nfrom government programs, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid, and from commercial payers.\nWe\nare also subject to comparable foreign regulations.\nThe FDC Act, the Controlled Substances Act, their implementing regulations,\nand similar foreign laws generally\nregulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion,\nsampling, pricing and\nreimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or recalling,\nreporting, and distribution of, and\nrecord keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states\nmay similarly\nregulate such activities within the state.\nFurthermore, Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides\nauthority to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable\ndiseases, serves as the legal basis for\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and\ntissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”\nThe Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant\nchanges with respect to\npharmaceutical supply chain requirements.\nTitle II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act\n(“DSCSA”), was first implemented in November 2014 and will be phased\nin over a period of ten years. DSCSA is\nintended to build a national electronic, interoperable system by November\n27, 2023, that will identify and trace\ncertain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.\nThe law’s track and trace requirements\napplicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, third-party logistics providers (e.g.,\ntrading partners), repackagers and\ndispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and\ncontinues to be implemented.\nThe DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree\nrequirements and pre-empt certain\nstate requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or\nin addition to, the DSCSA requirements.\nThe DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation\nof prescription drug wholesalers\nand third-party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the eventual\ncreation of national wholesaler and 3PL\nlicenses in cases where states do not license such entities.\nThe DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs\ndistribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping,\nstorage and handling of\nprescription drugs.\nThe DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports\nto the FDA, which include\ninformation regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name\nand address of each facility and\ncontact information.\nAccording to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing\nany licensing requirements\nthat are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered\nby the standards established by federal\nlaw in this area.\nCurrent state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will\nremain in effect until the FDA\nissues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA.\nIn addition, with respect to our specialty home medical supply\nbusiness, we are subject to certain state licensure laws (including state pharmacy\nlaws), and also certain\naccreditation standards, including to qualify for reimbursement from\nMedicare and other third-party payers.\n11\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and\nthe Food and Drug Administration Safety and\nInnovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate\nregulations to implement a unique\ndevice identification (“UDI”) system.\nThe UDI rule phased in the implementation of the UDI\nregulations,\ngenerally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices)\nand ending with the lowest-risk\ndevices.\nMost compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018, with\na final set of requirements for low\nrisk devices being reached on September 24, 2022, which completed the\nphase in.\nHowever, in May 2021, the\nFDA issued an enforcement policy stating that it does not intend to\nobject to the use of legacy identification\nnumbers on device labels and packages for finished devices manufactured\nand labeled prior to September 24, 2023.\nThe UDI regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers\n(“UDIs”), with a content and format\nprescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited\nissuing agency, on the labels and\npackages of medical devices (including, but not limited to, certain software\nthat qualifies as a medical device under\nFDA rules), and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs.\nThe UDI regulations also require labelers to submit\ncertain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which\ninformation is publicly available\non an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database.\nOn July 22, 2022, the FDA posted the\nfinal guidance regarding the Global Unique Device Identification Database\ncalled Unique Device Identification\nPolicy Regarding Compliance Dates for Class I and Unclassified Devices, Direct\nMarketing, and Global Unique\nDevice Identification Database Requirements for Certain Devices.\nThe UDI regulations and subsequent FDA\nguidance regarding the UDI requirements provide for certain exceptions, alternatives\nand time extensions.\nFor\nexample, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices\nexempt from the Quality System\nRegulation (other than record-keeping requirements and complaint files).\nRegulated labelers include entities such\nas device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a\ndevice’s label to be applied or\nmodified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without\nany subsequent replacement or\nmodification of the label and include certain of our businesses.\nUnder the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances,\nwe are required to obtain and renew\nannually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug\nEnforcement Administration (“DEA”)\npermitting us to handle controlled substances.\nWe are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements\nrelating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, reporting, record-keeping\nand distribution of such drugs, in\naccordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations,\nand these requirements have been\nsubject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.\nWe\nare subject to inspection by the DEA.\nCertain of\nour businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses\nwith, and comply with operating and security\nstandards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health\nand Human Services (“HHS”), and\nvarious state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable\nforeign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies, depending on the type of\noperations and location of product\ndistribution, manufacturing or sale.\nThese businesses include those that distribute, manufacture, relabel, and/or\nrepackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P\nproducts, or own pharmacy\noperations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.\nIn addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil\nand/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example,\nhuman bone products) for valuable\nconsideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs\nincurred in procuring, processing,\nstoring and distributing that tissue.\nWe\nare also subject to foreign government regulation of such products.\nThe\nDEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement\npowers, including the ability\nto suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers,\nseize or order the recall of products and\nimpose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of\nthese laws and regulations.\nForeign\nregulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.\nEU Regulation of Medicinal and Dental Products\nEuropean Union (“EU”) member states regulate their own healthcare systems,\nas does EU law.\nThe latter regulates\ncertain matters, most notably medicinal products and medical devices.\nMedicinal products are defined, broadly, as\nsubstances or combinations of substances having certain functionalities and\nmay not include medical devices.\nEU\n“regulations” apply in all member states, whereas “directives” are implemented\nby the individual laws of member\nstates.\n12\nOn medicines for humans, we are regulated under Directive No. 2001/83/EC\nof 6 November 2001, as amended by\nDirective 2003/63/EC of 25 June 2003, and EU Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004\nof 31 March 2004.\nThese rules\nprovide for the authorization of products, and regulate their manufacture,\nimportation, marketing and distribution.\nIt implements requirements which may be implemented without warning, as\nwell as a national pharmacovigilance\nsystem under which marketing authorizations may be withdrawn, and includes\npotential sanctions for breaches of\nthe rules, and on other bases such as harmfulness or lack of efficacy.\nEU Regulation No. 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009\non cosmetic products\nrequires that cosmetic products (which\nincludes dental products) be safe for human health when used under normal\nor reasonably foreseeable conditions of\nuse and comply with certain obligations which apply to manufacturer, importer and distributor.\nIt includes market\nsurveillance, and non-compliance may result in the recall or withdrawal of\nproducts, along with other sanctions.\nIn the EU, the EU Medical Device Regulation No. 2017/745 of 5 April 2017\n(“EU MDR”) covers a wide scope of\nour activities, from dental material to X-ray machines, and certain software.\nIt was meant to become applicable\nthree years after publication (i.e., May 26, 2020).\nHowever, on April 23, 2020, to allow European Economic Area\n(“EEA”) national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors\nto focus fully on urgent priorities\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Council and Parliament\nadopted Regulation 2020/561,\npostponing the date of application of the EU MDR by one year (to\nMay 26, 2021).\nThe EU MDR significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance\nrequirements for the medical device\nindustry as a whole.\nAmong other things, the EU MDR:\n•\nstrengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance\nonce they are available;\n•\nestablishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities\nfor the follow-up of the quality,\nperformance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n•\nimproves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the\nend-user or patient through\na unique identification number;\n•\nsets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and\nthe public with comprehensive\ninformation on products available in the EU;\n•\nstrengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such\nas implants, which may have to\nundergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n•\nidentifies importers and distributors and medical device products through\nregistration in a database\n(EUDAMED, which is not fully functional for the time being and might\nnot be so before the end of 2024 at\nthe earliest; therefore, the use of this database is only possible through\na voluntary basis and, by a way of\nconsequence, is currently not mandatory).\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes strict requirements for the confirmation that a product meets\nthe regulatory\nrequirements, including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems, and for the\ndistribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market\nsurveillance. Medical devices that have\nbeen assessed and/or certified under the Directive No. 93/42/EEC of\n14 June 1993\nconcerning medical devices\n(“EU Medical Device Directive”) may for the moment continue to be placed\non the market until 2024 (or until the\nexpiry of their certificates, if applicable and earlier).\nHowever, on January 6, 2023, the EU Commission submitted a\nproposed amendment to extend the MDR transitional periods until December\n31, 2027 for higher risk devices and\nDecember 31, 2028, for other medical devices to ensure continued access\nto medical devices for patients and to\nallow medical devices already placed on the market in accordance with\nthe current legal framework to remain on\nthe market. We continue to monitor developments and whether the proposed amendment and new deadlines will be\napproved by the European Parliament and Council. Nevertheless, EU MDR\nrequirements regarding the distribution,\nmarketing and sale including quality systems and post-market surveillance\nhave to be observed by manufacturers,\nimporters and distributors as of the application date (i.e., since May 26, 2021).\nOther EU regulations that may apply under appropriate circumstances\ninclude EU Regulation No. 1907/2006 of 18\nDecember 2006\nconcerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and\nRestriction of Chemicals\n, which\nrequires importers to register substances or mixtures that they import\nin the EU beyond certain quantities, and the\nEU Regulation No. 1272/2008 of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling\nand packaging of substances and\nmixtures, which sets various obligations with respect to the labelling and\npackaging of concerned substances and\nmixtures.\n13\nFurthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future\nrequire us to delay product\nrelease, sale or distribution, or institute voluntary recalls of, or other corrective\naction with respect to products we\nsell, each of which could result in regulatory and enforcement actions, financial\nlosses and potential reputational\nharm.\nOur customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local\nand foreign governmental regulation, which\nmay affect our interactions with customers, including the design and functionality\nof our products.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state,\nlocal and foreign laws and regulations,\nincluding with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and\ndisposal of hazardous or potentially\nhazardous substances, and safe working conditions.\nIn addition, certain of our businesses must operate in\ncompliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and record-keeping\nrequirements in order to\nsubstantiate claims for payment under federal, state and commercial healthcare\nreimbursement programs.\nOne of\nthese businesses was suspended in October 2021 by CMS from receiving\npayments from Medicare, although it was\npermitted to continue to perform and bill for Medicare services.\nOn September 30, 2022, CMS terminated the\nsuspension of Medicare payments.\nAs a result of the termination of the suspension, we recognized\n$4 million of\npreviously deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nCertain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies\nand are subject to certain regulatory\nrequirements specific to government contractors.\nAntitrust and Consumer Protection\nThe federal government of the United States, most U.S. states and many\nforeign countries have antitrust laws that\nprohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, as well as consumer\nprotection laws that seek to\nprotect consumers from improper business practices.\nAt the U.S. federal level, the Federal Trade Commission\noversees enforcement of these types of laws, and states have similar government\nagencies.\nViolations of antitrust\nor consumer protection laws may result in various sanctions, including criminal\nand civil penalties.\nPrivate\nplaintiffs may also bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust\nlaw violations, including\nclaims for treble damages.\nEU law also regulates competition and provides for detailed rules protecting\nconsumers.\nThe Biden Administration has indicated increased antitrust enforcement and\nhas been more aggressive in\nenforcement activities, including investigation and challenging non-compete\nrestrictions and other restrictive\ncontractual terms that it believes harm workers and competition.\nHealth Care Fraud\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar\nforeign) health care fraud and abuse, referral\nand reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.\nSome of these laws, referred to as “false\nclaims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent\nclaims for reimbursement to\nfederal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nOther laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit\nsoliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral\nof a patient or ordering,\npurchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending, ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services\nthat are\npaid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nCertain additional state and federal laws, such\nas the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit physicians and other\nhealth professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the\nphysician (or family member) has a\nfinancial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services\n(for example, durable medical\nequipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies.\nViolations of Anti-Kickback Statutes or the Stark\nLaw may be enforced as violations of the federal False Claims Act.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened\nenforcement activity over the past few\nyears, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who\nserve as whistleblowers by filing\ncomplaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states)\nunder applicable false claims laws,\nand who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.\nPenalties under fraud and abuse laws may be\nsevere, including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under\nthe federal False Claims Act, as well as\npotential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state\nhealth care programs, criminal penalties,\nor imposition of a corporate integrity agreement or corporate compliance\nmonitor which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nAlso, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial,\nregulatory or\n14\njudicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes\nin our operations or incur substantial defense\nand settlement expenses.\nEven unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private\nrelators could result in\nreputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.\nMost states have adopted similar state false claims laws,\nand these state laws have their own penalties, which may be in addition\nto federal False Claims Act penalties, as\nwell as other fraud and abuse laws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns\nabout\nfinancial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians,\ndentists and other healthcare\nprofessionals on the other.\nAs a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary\nto\nfacilitate compliance.\nWe\nalso are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations\nconcerning the conduct of our foreign\noperations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nAct, German anti-corruption laws\nand other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal\nbooks and records, which have been\nthe focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and\nabuse laws and regulations, and\nhave adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial\ncompliance, we cannot predict\nwhether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in\nresponse to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, or failure\nto comply with applicable law, could have\na material adverse effect on our business.\nAffordable Care Act and Other Insurance Reform\nThe ACA increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and\nincluded a number of provisions\ndesigned to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to\nprovide access to increased health coverage.\nThe ACA also materially expanded the number of individuals\nin the\nUnited States with health insurance.\nThe ACA has faced frequent legal challenges, including litigation seeking\nto invalidate and Congressional action\nseeking to repeal some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been\nimplemented.\nIn 2012, the United\nStates Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the\nACA and its individual mandate provision requiring\nthat people buy health insurance or else face a penalty, simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid\nexpansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision.\nIn addition, one of the major political parties in the\nUnited States remains committed to seeking the ACA’s legislative repeal, but legislative efforts to do so have\npreviously failed to pass both chambers of Congress.\nUnder President Trump’s administration, a number of\nadministrative actions were taken to materially weaken the ACA, including,\nwithout limitation, by permitting the\nuse of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support”\nfor insurers providing policies\nunder the ACA.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions\nthat impact the individual and corporate\ntax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions\nand\ndeductions, also effectively repealed the ACA’s\nindividual mandate by zeroing out the penalty for non-compliance.\nIn the most recent ACA litigation, the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals\nfound the individual mandate to be\nunconstitutional, and returned the case to the District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Texas for consideration of\nwhether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual\nmandate.\nThe Fifth Circuit’s\ndecision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court issued a decision on June 17, 2021.\nWithout reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing\nto challenge the ACA.\nAny outcomes of future cases that change the ACA, in addition\nto future legislation,\nregulation, guidance and/or Executive Orders that do the same, could have a\nsignificant impact on the U.S.\nhealthcare industry.\nFor instance, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced\npremium tax credits, which has\nresulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the ACA.\nThese changes are time-limited, with\nsome enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through\nthe end of 2022.\nAn ACA provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine\nAct or Open Payments Program (the\n“Sunshine Act”), imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements\nfor drug and device manufacturers and\ndistributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain\ncovered recipients (including\nphysicians, dentists, teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners,\nclinical nurse specialists, certified\n15\nregistered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives), and for such manufacturers\nand distributors and for\ngroup purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by covered\nrecipients in the\nreporting entity.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information\nfrom these\nreports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician,\ndentist, teaching hospital, and\nnon-physician practitioner identities.\nThe Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we\nor our\nsubsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that\naddress circumstances not covered\nby the Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal\nlaw, can be unclear.\nWe\nare also subject to\nforeign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between\nsuppliers and their customers.\nIn the United States, government actions to seek to increase health-related\nprice transparency may also affect our\nbusiness.\nFor example, hospitals are currently required to publish online a\nlist of their standard charges for all items\nand services, including discounted cash prices and payer-specific and de-identified negotiated\ncharges, in a publicly\naccessible online file. Hospitals are also required to publish a consumer-friendly\nlist of standard charges for certain\n“shoppable” services (i.e., services that can be scheduled by a patient in\nadvance) and associated ancillary services\nor, alternatively, maintain an online price estimator tool. CMS may impose civil monetary penalties for\nnoncompliance with these price transparency requirements. Additionally, the No Surprises Act (“NSA”), generally\neffective January 1, 2022, imposes additional price transparency requirements.\nThe NSA is intended to reduce the\nnumber of “out-of-network” patients.\nThis will result in fewer out-of-network payments to physicians and\nother\nproviders, which may cause financial stress to those providers who\nare dependent on higher out-of-network fees.\nAnother notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access\nand CHIP Reauthorization Act of\n2015 (“MACRA”), enacted on April 16, 2015, established a new payment framework,\nwhich modified certain\nMedicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists and\nother practitioners.\nUnder MACRA,\ncertain eligible clinicians are required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based\nIncentive Payment\nSystem (“MIPS”) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models, through which\nMedicare reimbursement to eligible\nclinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take\ninto account quality, promoting\ninteroperability, cost and improvement activities.\nData collected in the first MIPS performance year (2017)\ndetermined payment adjustments that began January 1, 2019.\nMACRA standards and payment levels continue to\nevolve, and reflect a fundamental change in physician reimbursement\nthat is expected to provide substantial\nfinancial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase\nphysician information technology\nand reporting obligations.\nThe implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will\ndepend on\nfuture regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.\nNew state-level payment and delivery system\nreform programs, including those modeled after such federal programs, are\nalso increasingly being rolled out\nthrough Medicaid administrators, as well as through the private sector, which may further\nalter the marketplace and\nimpact our business.\nRecently, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been increased scrutiny on\ndrug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the\nPresident, executive branch\nagencies and various states.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers\nto\nprovide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information\nrelating to those price increases, while\nothers have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription\ndrug affordability boards or multi-\npayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\nAt the federal level, several related bills have been\nintroduced and regulations proposed which, if enacted or finalized,\nrespectively, would impact drug pricing and\nrelated costs.\nAs a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution\nindustry in the United\nStates is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.\nWe\ncannot predict what further reform\nproposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nEU Directive on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products\nEU law provides for the regulation of the pricing of medicinal products which are\nimplemented by EU member\nstates (Directive No. 89/105/EC of 21 December 1988\nrelating to the transparency of measures regulating the\npricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance\nsystems\n).\nMember states may, subject notably to transparency conditions and to the statement of reasons based upon\nobjective and verifiable criteria, regulate the price charged (or its increases) for authorized\nmedicines and their level\n16\nof reimbursement, or they may freeze prices, place controls on the profitability\nof persons responsible for placing\nmedicinal products on the market, and include or exclude the medicine on\nthe list of products covered by national\nhealth insurance systems.\nEU law does not expressly include provisions like those of the Sunshine Act\nin the United States, but a growing\nnumber of EU member states (such as France in 2011 and Italy in 2022) have enacted laws to increase\nthe\ntransparency of relationships in the healthcare sector.\nThe scope of these laws varies from one member state to\nanother and may, for example, include the relations between healthcare industry players and physicians or their\nassociations, students preparing for medical professions or their associations,\nteachers, health establishments or\npublishers of prescription and dispensing assistance software.\nRegulated Software; Electronic Health Records\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of\ncomputer software and digital health\nproducts intended for use in health care settings.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), signed into law on\nDecember 13, 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition\nto exclude certain software from\nFDA regulation, including clinical decision\nsupport software that meets certain criteria.\nOn September 27, 2019,\nthe FDA issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products, which\nincorporated applicable Cures Act\nstandards, including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other\nsoftware that are exempt from\nregulation by the FDA as medical devices, and continues to issue new guidance\nin this area.\nCertain of our\nbusinesses involve the development and sale of software and related products\nto support physician and dental\npractice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government\nauthorities could determine that one or\nmore of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one\nor more of our businesses to substantial\nadditional requirements\nwith respect to these products.\nIn addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management\nproducts, and our specialty home\nmedical supply business, include electronic information technology systems\nthat store and process personal health,\nclinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.\nThese information technology systems may be\nvulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious\nattack, which could require us to\nexpend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related\nsecurity concerns and could involve\nclaims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nFor example, we are directly or indirectly\nsubject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and\nregulations that protect the privacy and\nsecurity of personal information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996,\nas amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography\nand Marketing Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission\nAct, the California Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) that became effective\non January 1, 2023.\nAdditionally, Virginia,\nColorado, Connecticut and Utah recently passed comprehensive\nprivacy legislation, and several privacy bills have been proposed both at\nthe federal and state level that may result\nin additional legal requirements that impact our business.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy and data\nprotection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations.\nThese requirements may not\nbe harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent\nfrom one jurisdiction to another or\nmay conflict with other rules or our practices.\nOur businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations\ncould expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and\nother liabilities and expenses, costs for\nremediation and harm to our reputation.\nAlso, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the\nability of\nour customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could\nrequire us to incur significant additional\ncosts to re-design our products to reflect these legal requirements, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on\nour operations.\nAlso, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted the pan-European\nGeneral Data Protection\nRegulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy\nrights for individuals (“Data\nSubjects”), including individuals who are our customers, suppliers and\nemployees.\nThe GDPR extended the scope\nof responsibilities for data controllers and data processors, and generally\nimposes increased requirements and\npotential penalties on companies, such as us, that are either established\nin the EU and process personal data of Data\nSubjects (regardless the Data Subject location), or that are not established\nin the EU but that offer goods or services\nto Data Subjects in the EU or monitor their behavior in the EU. Noncompliance\ncan result in penalties of up to the\ngreater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues (sanction\nthat may be public), and Data Subjects\n17\nmay seek damages.\nMember states may individually impose additional requirements\nand penalties regarding\ncertain limited matters (for which the GDPR let some room of flexibility),\nsuch as employee personal data.\nWith\nrespect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR requires, among other things,\ncontroller accountability, consents\nfrom Data Subjects or another acceptable legal basis to process the\npersonal data, notification within 72 hours of a\npersonal data breach where required, data integrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the\nstorage, use or other processing of the personal data.\nThe GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating\nnotably to information, access, rectification, erasure of the personal\ndata and\nthe right to object to the processing.\nOn August 20, 2021, China promulgated the PRC Personal Information\nProtection Law (“PIPL”), which took effect\non November 1, 2021.\nThe PIPL imposes specific rules for processing personal information\nand it also specifies\nthat the law shall also apply to personal information activities carried out\noutside China but for the purpose of\nproviding products or services to PRC citizens.\nAny non-compliance with these laws and regulations may\nsubject\nus to fines, orders to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed\nillegal by regulatory authorities, other\npenalties, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings against us,\nwhich may affect our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nThe PIPL carries maximum penalties of CNY50 million or 5% of the\nannual\nrevenue of entities that process personal data.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became\neffective January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections\nregarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information\nof California residents.\nCompliance\nwith the obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them.\nRegulations were released in August of 2020, but there remains some\nuncertainty about how the CCPA will be\ninterpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators.\nIf we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert\nthat we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation,\nany of which may negatively impact our reputation, require us to expend\nsignificant resources, and harm our\nbusiness.\nFurthermore, California voters approved the CPRA on November 3,\n2020, which amends and expands\nthe CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information, and\ncreating a new state agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency, to enforce the CCPA\nand the CPRA.\nThe\nCPRA came into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information collected by\nbusinesses on or after January 1,\n2022.\nOther states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly\nconsidered the adoption of similarly expansive\npersonal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance.\nVirginia and Colorado were both\nsuccessful in passing privacy legislation in 2021, becoming effective on January\n1, 2023 and July 1, 2023,\nrespectively.\nIn 2022, privacy legislation passed in Connecticut, effective July 1, 2023, and\nUtah, effective\nDecember 31, 2023.\nWhile we believe we have substantially compliant programs\nand controls in place to comply\nwith the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL, CPRA and state law requirements, our compliance with data privacy and\ncybersecurity laws is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot\npredict whether the interpretations of\nthe requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements\nor interpretations of the\nrequirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe\nalso sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians\nand dentists, use to store and\nmanage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers, and we, are subject to laws, regulations and industry\nstandards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of\nthe privacy and security of those records, and our products may also be\nused as part of these customers’\ncomprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with\napplicable privacy\nand security laws.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services,\nor the perceived or actual\nfailure by us or our customers\nwho use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or\ncontractual data\nprivacy and security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational\nharm, but may also lead to claims\nagainst us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial\nfines, penalties and other\nliabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nVarious\nfederal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care\nproviders of certain electronic health care\nrecords systems and processes.\nThe initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize\nphysicians and\ndentists, through MIPS, to use EHR technology in accordance with certain\nevolving requirements, including\nregarding quality, promoting interoperability, cost and improvement activities.\nQualification for the MIPS\n18\nincentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain\ncapabilities designated in evolving\nstandards adopted by CMS and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health\nInformation Technology of HHS\n(“ONC”).\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of such\ncertified EHR systems and other\nproducts linked to government supported incentive programs.\nIn order to maintain certification of our EHR\nproducts, we must satisfy these changing governmental standards.\nIf any of our EHR systems do not meet these\nstandards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive\nfederal incentive payments, we may be\nexposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws,\nincluding the False Claims Act.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers, and comply with evolving legal requirements, our products\nmay need\nto incorporate increasingly complex functionality, such as with respect to reporting and information blocking.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve\nincreased costs, and our failure to\nimplement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards,\ncould have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nOther health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic\nhealth data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic\ntransactions, such as transactions\ninvolving claims submissions to third party payers.\nFailure to abide by these and other electronic health data\ntransmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims,\nsubstantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities\nand expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the\nability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged\ninformation becomes\nincreasingly important.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with\nan electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nThere may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting\nhealth care.\nE-Commerce\nElectronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health\ncare supply and distribution\nrelationships.\nOur distribution business is characterized by rapid technological\ndevelopments and intense\ncompetition.\nThe continuing advancement of online commerce requires\nus to cost-effectively adapt to changing\ntechnologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a\nvariety of new services to address the\nchanging demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly\nin response to competitive\nofferings.\nThrough our proprietary, technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive\nalternatives.\nWe believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built\non solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in\nthis significant aspect of the distribution business.\nWe\ncontinue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our online\npresence and capabilities, including our\nonline commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.\nInternational Transactions\nUnited States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to\nabide by certain standards relating to\nthe importation and exportation of products.\nWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the\nconduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct, the U.K. Bribery Act, German\nanti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining\nto the accuracy of our internal books and\nrecords, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those\nimposed in the United States.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws\nand regulations promulgated\nthereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct\nof our business, there can be no\nassurance that laws and regulations that impact our business or laws and\nregulations as they apply to our customers’\npractices will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\n19\nSee “\n” for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments\nthat may\naffect our results of

trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nEnvironment, Social and Governance\nHenry Schein has remained steadfastly committed over our nine-decade history\nto the core philosophy that our\npurpose-driven mission of \"doing good\" for our stakeholders is inextricably\nlinked to our Company \"doing well\" in\nbusiness through our stakeholder engagement model “our Mosaic of Success”.\nWe balance the needs of our five\nkey stakeholders – Team Schein Members (TSMs), our Customers, our Suppliers, our Stockholders, and Society –\nto continue to drive our sustainability and ESG efforts to foster a healthier planet and healthier\npeople.\nOverseen\nby the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors with the\nCompensation Committee also\nplaying a role in ESG matters related to human capital engagement and executive\ncompensation, key 2022\nsustainability and ESG highlights included:\n●\nWith the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the humanitarian crises in Ukraine and other\nregions, we continued our efforts to drive an overall culture of wellness and engagement\nfor our TSMs as\nwe navigated a new hybrid work environment and ensure supply chain resiliency\nto support our customers\nand our communities.\nHenry Schein was named Chair of the Private Sector Roundtable\non Global Health\nSecurity, and continued its work across sectors to support the creation of market intelligence platforms that\nenable the appropriate sharing of real-time supply chain data, including through\nthe WHO's Pandemic\nSupply Chain Network and various national efforts, including the U.S. Supply Chain\nControl Tower.\n●\n(i) Publishing our annual Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability\nReport according to the Global\nReporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board reporting\nstandards and issuing our\nfirst Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures report; (ii) committing to announcing our carbon\nreduction goal by the end of 2023; (iii) continued initiatives and programs\nto advance health equity efforts\nto promote access to care for underserved and underrepresented communities,\ninvesting in diversity for\ngreater health equity in partnership with health care professionals, and\nincreasing awareness of health\nequity needs globally; (iv) announced the top line findings of our pay equity\nanalysis across the U.S., which\nreviews compensation across gender and ethnic groups; (v) expanding our\nDiversity and Inclusion (“D&I”)\nlearning journey, such as by educating global directors and vice presidents on more advanced topics of D&I\nincluding privilege and equity, as well as offering education to all global TSMs below director level on the\nimportance of D&I; and (vi) continuing to drive a culture of wellness for our\nTSMs by fostering an\nenvironment where they can feel engaged, included and psychologically\nsafe.\nAt Henry Schein, our employees are our greatest asset.\nWe employ more than 22,000 people, approximately 50%\nof our workforce is based in the United States and approximately 50%\nis based outside of the United States.\nApproximately 12% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nWe believe that our\nrelations with our employees are excellent.\nWe refer to our employees as Team\nSchein Members, or “TSMs.” Our TSMs are the cornerstone\nof the Company.\nWe have a strong values-based culture that cultivates a meaningful employee experience that is centered around\npeople.\nWe know our business success is built on the engagement and commitment of our team, which is dedicated\nto meeting the needs of their fellow TSMs, our customers, supplier partners,\nstockholders and society.\nAs part of\nthis commitment, our highlights in 2022 included:\n20\n●\nNurturing a connected community for a happier, more engaged, collaborative work environment.\nWe\ncontinue to adapt to the new way of working for our TSMs by listening\nto their needs.\nWith TSMs working\nremotely, hybrid and in-person, our goal is to continue to create a collaborative community where every\nTSM feels connected to our culture.\nThrough various virtual and in-person programming from our\nEmployee Resource Groups, Wellness Committee and Team Schein Engagement team, we continue to\nbring TSMs together in a meaningful way through virtual education sessions\nand networking events.\nTo\nhelp create a sense of connection and belonging amongst the team, we\nlaunched “TSM Experience Panels,”\nwhich feature TSMs who share their authentic experiences and offer advice and\nbest practices on specific\ntopics. We offer a variety of opportunities to volunteer for team-building and engaging in their local\ncommunities in which they live and work such as through the We Care Global Challenge, Back to School,\nand Holiday Cheer. In addition, they can “help health happen” by participating in key programs and\ninitiatives (e.g., Gives Kids A Smile, Healthy Lifestyles, Healthy Communities\nand Release the Pressure)\nthat partner with industry associations, customers, and suppliers to support\naccess to quality health care for\nunderserved and underrepresented communities.\nWe continue to evaluate the engagement of our team\nthrough various listening mechanisms including roundtables, hosted\nby our CEO and Executive\nManagement Committee (“EMC”), and various surveys, including The\nPulse, our global culture survey that\nevaluates TSM engagement globally with results reviewed by senior leaders,\nreported to the Board of\nDirectors (“BOD”).\nThroughout 2022, we held 10 solutions-focused roundtables\nhosted by our EMC\nmembers with over 100 TSMs to dive in deeper and influence our\nstrategy on programs and processes\ndesigned to further enhance our culture.\n●\nDriving a culture of wellness for our team members and society.\nIn 2020, we launched a Mental Wellness\nCommittee with a mission to drive a culture of wellness and empower\nevery TSM to be their best self,\nmentally, emotionally and physically.\nThe Committee provides resources, guidance and support,\nand\nworks across our businesses to establish enhanced workplace norms to\nhelp improve and safeguard our\nTSMs’ wellness.\nWe actively engage leadership, including our CEO, EMC, BOD and TSMs alike in\nconversations around the importance of wellness in the workplace.\nIn 2022, we rolled-out an EMC video\nseries that focused on being more intentional in the way we work across\nour business.\nThese new\nworkplace norms focused on meeting and technology etiquette, successful\ncalendaring, establishing and\ncommunicating reasonable expectations and prioritization, the importance\nof taking and respecting time\noff, and the importance of making time for social connection. In addition to expanding\neducation on key\nmental health topics in partnership with our employee assistance vendor, we also rolled-out manager-\nspecific education to provide tips on how to identify signs of burnout\nand have conversations around\nwellness with their teams.\nWith the rise of suicide rates around the world, the Wellness Committee held\nseminars for the team on suicide prevention and hosted in-person community walks\nthat resulted in\ndonations to local suicide prevention organizations globally.\n●\nBeing committed to enhancing our D&I initiatives.\nWe believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and\ncultivates an environment filled with unique perspectives.\nAs a result, D&I helps us meet the needs of\ncustomers around the world and provide our TSMs an inclusive environment\nwhere they feel they belong.\nWe measure our success in D&I through, among other things, our global culture survey, where results in\n2021 showed D&I is our top strength out of 14 focus areas. To guide our efforts and education related to\nD&I, our Diversity and Inclusion Council, with engagement from our\nBOD and EMC, drives the\nCompany’s overall D&I strategy.\nTo deepen our commitment to D&I across the Company, Global\nDirectors and Vice Presidents each have a goal tied to their compensation to champion D&I and attend\neducation.\nWe continue to expand our D&I learning journey, educating global Directors and Vice\nPresidents on key D&I topics including leading inclusively, bias and equity.\nWe also continue to educate\nour global TSMs on the importance of D&I. Additionally, we promote engagement by utilizing our\nEmployee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which we continue to expand,\nas an inclusive and diverse vehicle\nfor all TSMs to share, connect, learn and develop both personally\nand professionally.\nEach of our ERGs\nhas a sponsor from our Executive Management Committee and our BOD\nand our CEO engages directly in\nmany of our ERG programs.\nWhile inclusion continues to remain a top priority, we also understand the\nimportance of ensuring our internal team reflects the diversity of our customers\nand society.\nIn addition to\nour current gender parity by 2030 goal, we announced a new goal in 2022 with\nan enhanced focus on\n21\nincreasing the diversity of all underrepresented groups in senior leadership\nlevels through our talent\nplanning, compensation and recruitment processes, in alignment with\nour corporate strategic planning\nobjectives to achieve concrete results.\nWe continue to disclose additional diversity data, with frequent\nreporting to the EMC and BOD.\nIn 2022, we published our United States Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (“EEOC”) EEO-1 data for the U.S. for the first time.\nWe continue to enhance our recruiting\nstrategy by developing and investing in strategic hires who complement\nour D&I mission.\nWe believe that\nthese efforts will serve as a critical steppingstone as we continue to strengthen our\nD&I initiatives in an\neffort to meet the evolving needs of our customers, supplier partners, TSMs, stockholders\nand society.\n●\nUnderstanding that growth, recognition and purpose are key pillars to TSM fulfillment.\nPersonal and\nprofessional development of our TSMs is important to us.\nAs such, we invest in our employees by\nproviding both formal and informal learning opportunities that are\nfocused on growing and enhancing\nknowledge, skills and abilities.\nTSMs globally are offered a broad suite of professional development\ntraining programs targeted to specific learning opportunities based on their current\nand potential future role\nwithin the Company.\nWe also offer over 50 organizational and development training courses designed to\naid in the overall development and advancement of skills and competencies\nto enable organizational\nsuccess.\nExecutive education, mentorship and coaching programs also\nform an important part of our\ndevelopment and career support initiatives.\nAdditionally, we continued to see an increase in participation\nin our Organizational Development initiatives in 2022 with our TSMs reporting\na high utilization of skills\nlearned.\nTalent planning efforts are also an integral part of our commitment to ensure a strong diverse\nleadership pipeline across the organization.\nThrough a formal global process, we strategically identify and\ndevelop talent through targeted development opportunities and intentional succession\nplans.\nWe\ncontinuously identify potential management successors as part\nof our succession planning process.\nInformation derived from talent planning efforts informs curriculum design and\ncontent to help focus on the\nright capabilities and help ensure alignment of career development\nefforts with the future needs of the\norganization.\nOur BOD is provided with periodic updates regarding our\ntalent and succession planning\nefforts and participates in professional development activities with our TSMs.\nWe know recognition and\npurpose are also key pillars to TSM engagement, so we continue to find\nways to recognize our TSMs\nthrough our annual performance review process, and various recognition\nopportunities including our Teddy\nPhilson Team Schein Award,\nwhich highlights TSMs who exemplify our Team Schein Values.\nIn addition,\nwe continue to focus on ensuring every TSM understands the importance\nin the role they play within the\norganization, how they contribute to a larger purpose of creating a healthier world, as well as\ncontinue to\nprovide opportunities for TSMs to engage in meaningful ways\nthat connect back to their own personal\npurpose, such as helping the community through CSR activities.\nAvailable Information\nWe make

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, an\nunprecedented impact on society, worldwide\neconomic activity, and the health care sector (particularly, the dental market). As a global healthcare solutions\ncompany, the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it had, and may again have, a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows and may result\nin a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition and liquidity.

Such previous closures and restrictions impacted our\ncustomers’ spending with us and had, and\nif reinstated may again have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand cash flows.\nAlthough we believe that most practices currently are able to access\nadequate supply, we still may be unable to\nsupply our customers with the specific brand and/or quantity of certain PPE products,\nCOVID-19 tests and other\nCOVID-19 related products they demand, which may lead to our\ncustomers seeking alternative sources of supply.\nHealthcare professionals’ inability to obtain a sufficient quantity and/or brand of certain PPE, COVID-19\ntests and\nother COVID-19 related products would adversely impact our business,\nresults of operations and cash flows, and\ncould materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity;\n26\n•\nReduction in Peoples’ Ability and Willingness to be in Public.\nRestrictions recommended by several public health\norganizations, and implemented, from time to time, by federal, state and local governments,\nto slow and limit the\ntransmission of COVID-19 and variants thereof has caused and may in\nthe future cause some people to be less\nwilling to go to elective medical and dental appointments, which could\nagain materially adversely affect demand\nfor our products.\nA lengthened period of materially suppressed demand could again cause\nmaterial adverse impacts\non our business, results of operations and cash flows and could materially\nadversely affect our financial condition\nand liquidity;\n•\nNegative impact on our workforce and impact of adapted business practices.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and\nvariants thereof caused us to modify our business practices (including\nemployee travel, employee work locations,\nand physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and\nwe may take further actions as may be required\nby government authorities or our customers or that we determine are in the\nbest interests of our employees. As the\nCOVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, we continue to evaluate\nappropriate actions for our business. At the onset\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our office-based workers shifted abruptly to\nworking remotely. As the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has evolved, we have modified our work\narrangements to implement more flexible working\narrangements for our office-based workers, including permanent work from home,\nhybrid and office-based\narrangements. Implementing these modified business practices\nto include remote work arrangements could have a\nnegative impact on employee morale, strain our business continuity plans,\nintroduce operational risk (including but\nnot limited to cybersecurity risks), and impair our ability\nto efficiently operate our business;\n•\nSignificant changes in political conditions.\nSignificant changes in political conditions in markets in which\nwe\npurchase and distribute our products have occurred and are expected to\ncontinue at least during the pendency of the\npandemic, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures\nor other restrictions that limit or\nclose our operating facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to\ntravel or perform necessary business functions, or\notherwise constrain the operations of our business partners, suppliers or\ncustomers, which may materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition\nand liquidity;\n•\nVolatility\nin the financial markets.\nVolatility\nin the financial markets may materially adversely affect the\navailability and cost of credit to us;\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed\nbelow, any of which could have\na material adverse effect on us.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of a significant volume of our products.\nWe obtain a significant volume of the products we distribute from third parties, with whom we generally do not\nhave long-term contracts.\nWhile there is typically more than one source of supply, some key suppliers, in the\naggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell.\nIn 2022, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers\nand our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 28% and 4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.\nBecause of our dependence upon such suppliers, our operations are\nsubject to the suppliers’ ability and willingness\nto supply products in the quantities that we require, and the risks include delays\ncaused by interruption in\nproduction based on conditions outside of our control, including\na supplier’s failure to comply with applicable\ngovernment requirements (which may result in product recalls and/or\ncessation of sales) or an interruption in the\nsuppliers’ manufacturing capabilities.\nIn the event of any such interruption in supply, we would need to identify\nand obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis.\nThere is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain\nsuch alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all, and an extended\ninterruption in supply, particularly of\na high sales volume product, could result in a significant disruption\nin our sales and operations, as well as damage\nto our relationships with customers and our reputation.\nIn addition, certain of our suppliers have had their ability to\nservice certain markets restricted or negatively impacted because\nof allegations of forced labor in their supply\nchain.\nForced labor legislation affecting the supply chain has increased around the\nworld, and the United States\nrecently passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.\nOur supply chain could be materially disrupted if our\nsuppliers fail to comply with, or are unable to satisfy our demand\nfor products, as a result of applicable forced labor\nlegislation and regulations.\n27\nOur\nfuture\ngrowth\n(especially\nfor\nour\ntechnology\nand\nvalue-added\nservices\nsegment)\nis\ndependent\nupon\nour\nability\nto\ndevelop\nor\nacquire\nand\nmaintain\nand\nprotect\nnew\nproducts\nand\ntechnologies\nthat\nachieve\nmarket\nacceptance with acceptable margins.\nOur future success depends on our ability to timely develop (or obtain the right\nto sell) competitive and innovative\n(particularly for our technology and value-added services segment)\nproducts and services and to market them\nquickly and cost-effectively.\nOur ability to anticipate customer needs and emerging trends and develop or acquire\nnew products, services and technologies at competitive prices requires significant\nresources, including employees\nwith the requisite skills, experience and expertise, particularly in our technology\nsegment, including dental practice\nmanagement, patient engagement and demand creation software solutions.\nThe failure to successfully address these\nchallenges could materially disrupt our sales and operations.\nAdditionally, our software and e-services products,\nlike software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are\nreleased.\nAny such defective software may result in increased expenses related\nto the software and could adversely\naffect our relationships with customers as well as our reputation.\nWith respect to certain software and e-services\nthat we develop, we rely primarily upon copyright, trademark and\ntrade secret laws, as well as contractual and\ncommon law protections and confidentiality obligations.\nWe cannot provide assurance that such legal protections\nwill be available, adequate or enforceable in a timely manner to protect\nour software or e-services products.\nRisks inherent in acquisitions,\ndispositions and joint ventures could offset the anticipated benefits.\nOne of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and\ninternational markets in part through\nacquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions\nand enter into joint ventures in the\nfuture. Such transactions require significant management attention,\nmay place significant demands on our\noperations, information systems, legal, regulatory, compliance-functions and financial resources, and there is risk\nthat one or more may not succeed. We cannot be sure, for example, that we will achieve the benefits of revenue\ngrowth that we expect from these acquisitions or joint ventures or\nthat we will avoid unforeseen additional costs,\ntaxes or expenses. Our ability to successfully implement our acquisition\nand joint venture strategy depends upon,\namong other things, the following:\n•\nthe availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at\nacceptable prices;\n•\nour ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially\nbe prohibited due to U.S. or\nforeign antitrust regulations;\n•\nthe liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on\nacceptable terms;\n•\nour ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or\njoint ventures;\n•\nour ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the\ncompanies we acquire; and\n•\nour ability to successfully integrate these companies’ operations, services,\nproducts and personnel with\nour culture, management policies, legal, regulatory and compliance policies,\ncybersecurity systems and\npolicies, internal procedures, working capital management, financial\nand operational controls and\nstrategies.\nFurthermore, some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give rise to\nan obligation to make contingent\npayments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments\ncould have material adverse impacts on our\nfinancial results individually or in the aggregate.\nAdditionally, when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or\nexecuting alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay\nthe accomplishment\nof our strategic objectives. Alternatively, we may dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are\nless\nthan we had anticipated.\nDispositions may also involve continued financial involvement\nin a divested business,\nsuch as through transition service agreements, indemnities or other current\nor contingent financial obligations.\nUnder these arrangements, performance by the acquired or divested\nbusiness, or other conditions outside our\ncontrol, could affect our future financial results.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we\nare a party may discourage\nthird parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in\nour stockholders receiving a premium\nover the market price of their shares.\n28\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may\nmake it more difficult for a third-party to\nacquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price\nthat certain investors might be willing to pay\nin the future for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions, among other things require (i) the affirmative vote\nof the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote\nto approve a merger, consolidation, or\na sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets;\nand (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders\nof at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (a) remove\na director; and (b) to amend or repeal our\nby-laws, with certain limited exceptions.\nIn addition, certain of our employee incentive plans provide\nfor\naccelerated vesting of stock options and other awards upon termination without cause\nwithin two years following a\nchange in control, or grant the plan committee discretion to accelerate\nawards upon a change of control.\nFurther,\ncertain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance\npayments and certain\nbenefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate\nfor good reason, in each\ncase within two years following a change in control or within ninety days prior\nto the effective date of the change in\ncontrol or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change\nin control.\nAdverse changes in supplier rebates or other purchasing incentives\ncould negatively affect our business.\nThe terms\non which\nwe purchase\nor sell\nproducts from\nmany suppliers\nmay entitle\nus to\nreceive a\nrebate or\nother\npurchasing incentive based on\nthe attainment of\ncertain growth goals. Suppliers may\nreduce or eliminate rebates\nor\nincentives\noffered\nunder\ntheir\nprograms,\nor\nincrease\nthe\ngrowth\ngoals\nor\nother\nconditions\nwe\nmust\nmeet\nto\nearn\nrebates\nor\nincentives\nto\nlevels\nthat\nwe\ncannot\nachieve.\nIncreased\ncompetition\neither\nfrom\ngeneric\nor\nequivalent\nbranded products\ncould result\nin us\nfailing to\nearn rebates\nor incentives\nthat are\nconditioned upon\nachievement of\ngrowth goals. Additionally,\nfactors outside of\nour control, such\nas customer preferences,\nconsolidation of suppliers\nor supply issues, can have a material impact on\nour ability to achieve the growth goals established\nby our suppliers,\nwhich may reduce the amount of rebates or incentives we receive. The occurrence of any of these events\ncould have\nan adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nSales of corporate brand products entail additional risks, including the risk that such sales could\nadversely affect\nour relationships with suppliers.\nWe\noffer certain corporate brand products that are available exclusively from us. The sale\nof such products subjects\nus to the risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell corporate brand products, including but\nnot\nlimited to\npotential product\nliability risks,\nmandatory or\nvoluntary product\nrecalls, potential\nsupply chain\nand\ndistribution\nchain\ndisruptions,\nand\npotential\nintellectual\nproperty\ninfringement\nrisks.\nAny\nfailure\nto\nadequately\naddress\nsome\nor\nall\nof\nthese\nrisks\ncould\nhave\nan\nadverse\neffect\non\nour\nbusiness, financial\ncondition\nor\noperating\nresults.\nIn\naddition,\nan\nincrease\nin\nthe\nsales\nof\nour\ncorporate\nbrand\nproducts may\nnegatively\naffect\nour\nsales\nof\nproducts\nowned\nby\nour\nsuppliers\nwhich,\nconsequently,\ncould\nadversely\nimpact\ncertain\nof\nour\nsupplier\nrelationships.\nOur\nability\nto\nlocate\nqualified,\neconomically\nstable\nsuppliers\nwho\nsatisfy\nour\nrequirements,\nand\nto\nacquire\nsufficient\nproducts in\na timely\nand effective\nmanner,\nis critical\nto ensuring,\namong other\nthings, that\ncustomer confidence\nis\nnot diminished.\nAny failure\nto develop\nsourcing relationships\nwith a\nbroad and\ndeep supplier\nbase could\nhave an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nThe health care products distribution industry is highly competitive\n(including, without limitation, competition\nfrom third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating, and we may not\nbe able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors.\nSome of our\ncompetitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which\ncould allow them to compete more\nsuccessfully.\nMost of our products are available from several sources and our customers\ntend to have relationships\nwith several distributors.\nCompetitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular\nproducts, which we would\nthen be unable to market. Manufacturers also could increase their\nefforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby\neliminate or reduce our role in distribution.\nIndustry consolidation among health care product distributors and\nmanufacturers, price competition, product unavailability, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or\n29\nto interruptions in manufacturing supply, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition.\nConsolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care\nproducts, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our margins and product availability.\nWe could be subject to charges and financial losses in the\nevent we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained\nin some of our contracts. Additionally,\ntraditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged\nby electronic online commerce\nsolutions.\nThe continued advancement of online commerce by third\nparties will require us to cost-effectively adapt\nto changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business\n(including with additional\nvalue-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and\nour customers on a timely basis.\nThe\nemergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and\neffectively respond to changes on a\ntimely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act\ncould materially adversely\naffect our business.\nThe ACA greatly expanded health insurance coverage in the United States\nand has been the target of litigation and\nCongressional reform efforts since its adoption.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the\nACA and its individual mandate provision in 2012, simultaneously\nlimited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid\nexpansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision.\nIn 2017, the U.S. Congress effectively repealed the\nACA’s\nindividual mandate provision by eliminating the financial penalty for non-compliance.\nIn the most recent\nACA litigation, a federal appeals court found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional,\nand returned the case to\na lower federal court for consideration of whether the remainder of the ACA\ncould survive the excision of the\nindividual mandate.\nThis decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme\nCourt issued a\ndecision on June 17, 2021.\nWithout reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in\nthe case did not have standing to challenge the ACA.\nAny outcome of future cases that change the ACA, in\naddition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or Executive Orders\nthat do the same, could have a\nsignificant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry.\nFor instance, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced\npremium tax credits, which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people\ncovered under the ACA.\nThese\nchanges are time-limited, with some enhancements in place for 2021\nonly and others available through the end of\n2022.\nThe health care industry is experiencing changes due to political, economic and\nregulatory influences that could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing\npolitical, economic and regulatory influences.\nIn recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing,\nsignificant changes\ndriven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other factors: trends\ntoward managed care; collective\npurchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners;\nand changes in\nreimbursements to customers, including increased attention to value-based payment\narrangements, as well as\ngrowing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental\nofficials.\nBoth our profitability\nand the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws\nand regulations reducing\nreimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and devices,\nand/or medical treatments or services, or\nchanges to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.\nIf we are unable to react effectively to\nthese and other changes in the health care industry, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nExpansion of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”), dental support organizations\n(“DSO”) or provider\nnetworks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive\ndisadvantage.\nThe health care products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which\ncan vary by manufacturer\nand/or product.\nUnder this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable\nprices for health care products\nthan we are able to obtain.\nThe multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health\ncare providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs and DSOs, demand more favorable\npricing terms.\nAdditionally, the formation of provider networks, GPOs and DSOs may shift purchasing decisions\nto entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship\nand may threaten our ability to compete\neffectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results.\nAlthough we are seeking to obtain similar\nterms from manufacturers to access lower prices demanded by GPO and\nDSO contracts or other contracts, and to\n30\ndevelop relationships with existing and emerging provider networks, GPOs and DSOs,\nwe cannot guarantee that\nsuch terms will be obtained or contracts executed.\nIncreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers\ncould harm our business.\nOur ability to meet our customers’ expedited delivery expectations is an\nintegral component of our business\nstrategy for which our customers rely.\nShipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business.\nWe ship\nalmost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear\nthe cost of shipment.\nAccordingly,\nany significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition\nor operating results.\nWhile we have recently experienced increases in the cost of shipping,\nwe do not expect these\nadditional expenses to be material to our results.\nHowever, it is possible that such costs could be material in the\nfuture.\nSimilarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers, including at transportation centers or\nshipping ports, could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially\nadversely affect our ability to deliver\nproducts on a timely basis.\nMACRO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS\nUncertain global and domestic macro-economic and political conditions\ncould materially adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nUncertain global and domestic macro-economic and political conditions\nthat affect the economy and the economic\noutlook of the United States, Europe, Asia and other parts of the\nworld could materially adversely affect our results\nof operations and financial condition.\nThese uncertainties, include, among other things:\n•\nelection results;\n•\nchanges to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without\nlimitation, the United States-\nMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December\n2020 (that went into effect in 2021) and other international trade agreements);\n•\ngreater restrictions on imports and exports;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions;\n•\nchanges in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy;\n•\ntariffs and sanctions;\n•\nchanges to the relationship between the United States and China;\n•\nsovereign debt levels;\n•\nthe inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived\neconomic, currency or\nbudgetary crises or issues;\n•\nconsumer confidence;\n•\nunemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured\nand underinsured population);\n•\nchanges in regulatory and tax regulations;\n•\ninterest rate fluctuations,\nand strengthening of the dollar, which have and will continue to impact our\nresults of operations;\n•\navailability of capital;\n•\nincreases in fuel and energy costs;\n•\nthe effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase\nprices over time and\npass through to our customers price increases we may receive;\n•\nchanges in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n•\nincreases in labor costs;\n•\nincreases in health care costs;\n•\nour aspirations, goals and disclosures related to environmental, social and\ngovernance (ESG) matters;\n•\nthe threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest (including, without limitation, the war in\nUkraine and the possibility of a wider European or global conflict);\nand\n•\nchanges in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and\ninvestment in territories and\ncountries where we do business.\n31\nAdditionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government\nspending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending,\nand/or higher income or corporate\ntaxes, which could depress spending overall.\nRecessionary or inflationary conditions and depressed levels of\nconsumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to\nreduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase\nour products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change\ntheir terms of sale. We have experienced\ninflationary pressures, including higher freight costs and interest expense.\nAlthough inflation impacts both our\nrevenues and costs, the depth and breadth of our product portfolio often\nallows us to offer lower-cost national brand\nsolutions or corporate brand alternatives to our more price-sensitive\ncustomers who are unable to absorb price\nincreases, thus positioning us to protect our gross profit.\nThe strengthening of the dollar, likewise, has impacted\nour revenues and costs, but neither inflation nor exchange rates have materially\nimpacted our results of operations\nin fiscal year 2022.\nWe generally sell products to customers with payment terms.\nIf customers’ cash flow or\noperating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled\npayments or obtain credit,\nthey may not be able to, or may delay, payment to us.\nLikewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or\nimpose different payment terms.\nREGULATORY\nAND LITIGATION RISKS\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements\ncould materially adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nWe strive to be compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below in all material\nrespects, and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls\nin place to ensure substantial\ncompliance.\nHowever, compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future as certain laws, regulations\nand\nguidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could\naffect our ability to comply, as well as,\nfuture changes, additions and enforcement approaches, including in light\nof political changes.\nWhen we discover\nsituations of non-compliance we seek to remedy them and bring\nthe affected area back into compliance.\nThe Biden\nAdministration has indicated that it will be more aggressive in its pursuing\nalleged violations of law, and it has\nrevoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal\nagency guidance to pursue such\nviolations, as well as indicating it was more prepared to pursue individuals\nfor corporate law violations, including\nan aggressive approach to anti-corruption activities.\nChanges with respect to the applicable laws, regulations and\nguidance described below may require us to update or revise our operations,\nservices, marketing practices, and\ncompliance programs and controls, and may impose additional and unforeseen\ncosts on us, pose new or previously\nimmaterial risks to us, or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere can be no assurance\nthat current and future government regulations will not adversely\naffect our business, and we cannot predict new\nregulatory priorities, the form, content or timing of regulatory actions,\nand their impact on the health care industry\nand on our business and operations.\nGlobal efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on\nproduct pricing.\nIn the United\nStates, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been increased\nscrutiny on drug\npricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President,\nexecutive branch agencies\nand various states.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers\nto provide\nadvance notice of certain price increases and to report information\nrelating to those price increases, while others\nhave taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug\naffordability boards or multi-payer\npurchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\nAt the federal level, several related bills have been\nintroduced and regulations proposed which, if enacted or finalized,\nrespectively, would impact drug pricing and\nrelated costs.\nUnder the Sunshine Act, we are required to collect and report detailed\ninformation regarding certain financial\nrelationships we have with covered recipients, including physicians, dentists,\nteaching hospitals, and certain other\nnon-physician practitioners.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be required to report information under certain state\ntransparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Sunshine\nAct, and some of these state laws, as\nwell as the federal law, can be unclear.\nWe are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain\ninteractions between suppliers and their customers.\nWhile we believe we have substantially compliant programs\nand controls in place satisfying the above laws and requirements, such\ncompliance imposes additional costs on us\nand the requirements are sometimes unclear.\nIn the United States, government actions to seek to increase health-\nrelated price transparency may also affect our business.\n32\nOur business is subject to additional requirements under various local, state,\nfederal and international laws and\nregulations applicable to the sale and distribution of, and third-party payment\nfor, pharmaceuticals and medical\ndevices and HCT/P products.\nAmong the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances\nAct, the FDC Act, the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act, including DSCSA,\nSection 361 of the Public Health\nServices Act and Section 401 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act\nof the Social Security Act.\nAmong other\nthings, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:\n•\nregulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion,\nsampling, pricing and\nreimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or\nrecalling, reporting, and\ndistribution of, and record keeping for drugs, HCT/P products and\nmedical devices,\nincluding\nrequirements with respect to unique medical device identifiers;\n•\nsubject us to inspection by the FDA and DEA and similar state authorities;\n•\nregulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products\nthat are considered\nhazardous materials;\n•\nrequire us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance\nwith applicable FDA\nrequirements;\n•\nrequire us to report average sales price (ASP) for drugs or biologicals payable\nunder Medicare Part B to\nCMS with or without a Medicaid drug rebate agreement;\n•\nrequire registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n•\nrequire record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug\nproducts;\n•\nrequire us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious\norders of controlled\nsubstances to the DEA and certain states;\n•\nrequire us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject\nus to inspection of our\nrecall procedures and activities;\n•\nimpose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or\nmedical device causes\nserious illness, injury or death;\n•\nrequire manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers of prescription\ndrugs to identify and\ntrace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed;\n•\nrequire the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party\nlogistics providers; and\n•\nmandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping, storage\nand handling of prescription drugs,\nand associated reporting requirements.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of\ncomputer software and digital health\nproducts intended for use in health care settings.\nThe Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016, among\nother things, amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software\nfrom FDA regulation, including\ncertain clinical decision support software.\nOn September 27, 2019, the FDA issued a suite of guidance documents\non digital health products, which incorporated applicable Cures Act standards,\nand on September 28, 2022, the\nFDA subsequently finalized certain of these guidance documents, including\nregarding the types of clinical decision\nsupport tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the FDA as\nmedical devices, and the FDA\ncontinues to issue new guidance in this area.\nCertain of our businesses involve the development and\nsale of\nsoftware and related products to support physician and dental practice management,\nand it is possible that the FDA\nor foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products\nis subject to regulation as a\nmedical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to\nsubstantial additional requirements,\ncosts and potential enforcement actions or liabilities for noncompliance with\nrespect to these products.\nApplicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require\nus to meet various standards\nrelating to, among other things, licensure or registration, program eligibility, procurement, third-party\nreimbursement, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and\nsupply tracking to product manufacturers,\nproduct labeling, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal\ninformation, installation, maintenance\nand repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products.\nThe FDA and DEA, as well as CMS\n(including with respect to complex Medicare reimbursement requirements\napplicable to our specialty home medical\nsupplies business), have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement\nactivities and, in particular, the DEA\nhas heightened enforcement activities due to the opioid crisis in the United States.\nOne of our businesses was\n33\nsuspended in October 2021 by CMS from receiving payments from\nMedicare, although it was permitted to continue\nto perform and bill for Medicare services.\nOn September 30, 2022, CMS terminated the suspension of Medicare\npayments.\nAs a result of the termination of the suspension, we recognized $4\nmillion of previously deferred\nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur business is also subject to requirements of similar and\nother foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.\nThe failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, or new interpretations\nof existing laws and regulations,\nor the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nThe costs\nto us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes\nand regulations, as they now exist and as they\nmay be modified, could be material.\nAllegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with\nthese\nlaws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant\nwith applicable laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate\ncompliance programs and controls in place to\nensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have not complied\nwith these laws, we are potentially\nsubject to warning letters, substantial civil and criminal penalties,\nmandatory recall of product, seizure of product\nand injunction, consent decrees and suspension or limitation of payments\nto us, product sale and distribution.\nIf we\nenter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we\ncould be required to make settlement\npayments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines\nand the loss of licenses.\nNon-compliance\nwith government requirements could also adversely affect our ability to participate\nin important federal and state\ngovernment health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid,\nand damage our reputation.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation may adversely affect our business.\nThe EU MDR, applicable since May 26, 2021, significantly modifies and intensifies\nthe regulatory compliance\nrequirements for the medical device industry as a whole.\nAmong other things, the EU MDR:\n•\nstrengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once\nthey are\navailable;\n•\nestablishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’\nresponsibilities for the follow-up of the quality,\nperformance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n•\nimproves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user\nor patient\nthrough a unique identification number;\n•\nsets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and\nthe public with\ncomprehensive information on products available in the EU;\n•\nstrengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such\nas implants, which may have to\nundergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n•\nidentifies importers and distributors and medical device products through\nregistration in a database\n(EUDAMED not due until 2024 and after as mentioned above).\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes strict requirements for the confirmation that a product\nmeets the regulatory\nrequirements, including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems, and for the\ndistribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market surveillance.\nMedical devices that have\nbeen assessed and/or certified under the EU Medical Device Directive\nmay continue to be placed on the market\nuntil 2024 (or until the expiry of their certificates, if applicable and earlier).\nHowever, on January 6, 2023, the EU\nCommission submitted a proposed amendment to extend the MDR transitional\nperiods until December 31, 2028,\nfor certain medical devices to ensure continued access to medical devices\nfor patients and to allow medical devices\nalready placed on the market in accordance with the current legal framework\nto remain on the market. We continue\nto monitor developments and whether the proposed amendment and\nnew deadlines will be approved by the\nEuropean Parliament and Council. Nevertheless, EU MDR requirements\nregarding the distribution, marketing and\nsale including quality systems and post-market surveillance have to be observed\nby manufacturers, importers and\ndistributors as of the application date (i.e., May 26, 2021).\nThe modifications created by the EU MDR may have an impact on the\nway we design and manufacture products\nand the way we conduct our business in the European Economic Area.\n34\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care\nfraud or other laws and regulations, we\ncould suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations,\nwhich could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar\nforeign) health care fraud and abuse, referral\nand reimbursement laws and regulations with\nrespect to their operations.\nSome of these laws, referred to as “false\nclaims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent\nclaims for reimbursement to\nfederal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nOther laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit\nsoliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral\nof a patient or ordering,\npurchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services\nthat are\npaid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nCertain additional state and federal laws, such\nas the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit physicians and other\nhealth professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the\nphysician (or family member) has a\nfinancial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services\n(for example, durable medical\nequipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies.\nViolations of Anti-Kickback statutes or the Stark\nLaw may be enforced as violations of the federal False Claims Act.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened\nenforcement activity over the past few\nyears, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who\nserve as whistleblowers by filing\ncomplaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states)\nunder applicable false claims laws,\nand who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.\nPenalties under fraud and abuse laws may be\nsevere, including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under\nthe federal False Claims Act, as well as\npotential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state\nhealth care programs, criminal penalties,\nor imposition of a corporate compliance monitor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlso,\nthese measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or\njudicial authority in a manner that\ncould require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense\nand settlement expenses.\nEven\nunsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result\nin reputational harm and the\nincurring of substantial costs.\nMost states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state\nlaws have\ntheir own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims\nAct penalties, as well as other fraud and abuse\nlaws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns\nabout\nfinancial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians,\ndentists and other health care providers,\non the other.\nAs a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices\nas necessary to facilitate\ncompliance.\nIn the EU, the Directive No. 2019/1937 of October 23, 2019,\non the protection of persons who report breaches of\nUnion law,\norganizes the legal protection of whistleblowers. This Directive covers whistleblowers\nreporting\nbreaches of certain EU laws, in particular as regards public health, the above-mentioned\nDirective No. 2001/83,\nRegulation No. 726/2004 or, as regards data protection, the GDPR. The Directive protects a wide range of\npeople\nand includes former employees. All private companies with 50 or\nmore employees are required to create effective\ninternal reporting channels. Though it was required before December 17, 2021,\nat the latest, the implementation of\nthis Directive by EU member states is still underway for some of\nthem. At the end of January 2023 and according\nto information available on public sources, sixteen EU member states have\nfully implemented it (France, Belgium,\nDenmark, Finland, Latvia, The Netherlands, Ireland, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Lithuania,\nRomania, Malta, Portugal,\nSweden and Bulgaria) while the process is ongoing in the others with varying\ndegrees of progress.\nWe also are subject to the requirements of the new Directive No. 2022/2464 on corporate sustainability reporting\n(\"CSR Directive\") adopted on December 14, 2022 and has to be\nimplemented by EU members states by July 6,\n2024, at the latest. By amending Directives No. 2004/109, No. 2006/43, No.\n2013/34 and Regulation No. 537/2014,\nthe CSR Directive strengthens the existing rules on non-financial\nreporting by setting new requirements for large\ncompanies to publish sustainability-related information and, in particular, disclose details about their\nrisks and\nimpacts on environmental matters.\nWe\nalso are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations\nconcerning the conduct of our foreign\noperations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nAct, German anti-corruption laws\n35\nand other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal\nbooks and records, which have been\nthe focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.\nOur businesses are generally subject to\nnumerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial\nresults, including, without limitation,\nsecurities, antitrust, consumer protection, and marketing laws and regulations.\nIn the EU, both active and passive bribery are criminalized.\nThe EU Council Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA\nof 22 July 2003\non combating corruption in the private sector\nestablishes more detailed rules on the liability of\nlegal persons and deterrent sanctions.\nHowever, the liability of legal persons is regulated at a national level.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and other\nlaws and regulations, could result in\nsignificant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of\nlicenses and the ability to participate in\nfederal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nWe may\ndetermine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees\nor enter into other arrangements to\nresolve such matters.\nIntentional or unintentional failure to comply with consent decrees could\nmaterially adversely\naffect our business.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and\nabuse and other laws and\nregulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls\nin place to ensure substantial\ncompliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our\nservices or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or\ninterpretation of laws, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the collection,\nstorage and processing of sensitive\npersonal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions,\nwe could be required to make\nsignificant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or\nother liabilities.\nOur businesses that involve physician and dental practice management\nproducts, and our specialty home medical\nsupply business, include electronic information technology systems that\nstore and process personal health, clinical,\nfinancial and other sensitive information of individuals.\nThese information technology systems may be vulnerable\nto breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack,\nwhich could require us to expend\nsignificant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security\nconcerns, and could involve claims\nagainst us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nWe are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations\nthat protect the privacy and security of personal information, such as HIPAA, the Controlling the Assault of Non-\nSolicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the\nFederal Trade Commission Act, the CCPA, and the CPRA that becomes effective on January 1, 2023.\nLaws and\nregulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving\nand subject to potentially differing\ninterpretations.\nThese requirements\nmay not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a\nmanner that is\ninconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other\nrules or our practices.\nOur businesses’\nfailure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of\ncontract claims, substantial fines,\npenalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to\nour reputation.\nAlso, evolving laws\nand regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain,\nuse or disseminate patient\ninformation, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to\nre-design our products to reflect these legal\nrequirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted\nthe GDPR effective from May 25, 2018,\nwhich increased privacy rights for individuals (“Data Subjects”), including\nindividuals who are our customers,\nsuppliers and employees.\nThe GDPR extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data\nprocessors, and generally imposes increased requirements and potential\npenalties on companies, such as us, that are\neither established in the EU and process personal data of Data Subjects\n(regardless the Data Subject location), or\nthat are not established in the EU but that offer goods or services to Data Subjects\nin the EU or monitor their\nbehavior in the EU. Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to\nthe greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global\ncompany revenues (sanction that may be public), and Data Subjects may\nseek damages.\nMember states may\nindividually impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain\nlimited matters (for which the GDPR\nleft some room of flexibility), such as employee personal data. With respect to the personal data it protects,\nthe\n36\nGDPR requires, among other things, controller accountability, consents from Data Subjects or another acceptable\nlegal basis to process the personal data, notification within 72 hours of\na personal data breach where required, data\nintegrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the storage, use or other processing of the personal\ndata.\nThe GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating notably\nto information, access, rectification, erasure\nof the personal data and the right to object to the processing.\nOn August 20, 2021, China promulgated the PIPL, which took effect on November\n1, 2021.\nThe PIPL imposes\nspecific rules for processing personal information and it also specifies\nthat the law shall also apply to personal\ninformation activities carried out outside China but for the purpose\nof providing products or services to PRC\ncitizens.\nAny non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject\nus to fines, orders to rectify or terminate\nany actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities, other penalties,\nas well as reputational damage or legal\nproceedings against us, which may affect our business, financial condition or results\nof operations.\nThe PIPL\ncarries maximum penalties of CNY50 million or 5% of the annual revenue of\nentities that process personal data.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became\neffective January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections\nregarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information\nof California residents.\nCompliance\nwith the obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them.\nRegulations were released in August of 2020, but there remains some\nuncertainty about how the CCPA will be\ninterpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators.\nIf we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert\nthat we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation,\nany of which may negatively impact our reputation, require us to expend\nsignificant resources, and harm our\nbusiness.\nFurthermore, California voters approved the CPRA on November 3,\n2020, which will amend and expand\nthe CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information, and\ncreating a new state agency to enforce CCPA and CPRA.\nThe CPRA came into effect on January 1, 2023, applying\nto information collected by businesses on or after January 1, 2022.\nOther states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly\nconsidered the adoption of similarly expansive\npersonal privacy laws, backed\nby significant civil penalties for non-compliance.\nVirginia and Colorado were both\nsuccessful in passing privacy legislation in 2021, becoming effective on January\n1, 2023 and July 1, 2023,\nrespectively.\nConnecticut and Utah also passed comprehensive privacy laws\nthat will go into effect in July 1, 2023\nand December 31, 2023.\nWhile we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls\nin place to\ncomply with the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL and CPRA requirements, our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity\nlaws is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether\nthe interpretations of the\nrequirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements\nor interpretations of the requirements,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and\nmanage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers and we are subject to laws, regulations and\nindustry\nstandards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of\nthe privacy and security of those records.\nOur products or services may be used as part of these customers’\ncomprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with\napplicable data\nprivacy and security laws and contractual requirements.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products\nor services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who\nuse our products or services to comply\nwith applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements,\nmay not only cause us significant\nreputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers\nand/or governmental agencies and\ninvolve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses\nand costs for remediation.\nUnder the GDPR, health data belong to the category of “sensitive data” and benefit\nfrom specific protections.\nProcessing of such data is generally prohibited, except for specific exceptions.\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of EHR systems\nand other products linked to\ngovernment supported incentive programs, where the EHR systems\nmust be certified as having certain capabilities\ndesignated in evolving standards, such as those adopted by CMS and ONC.\nIn order to maintain certification of our\nEHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards.\nIf any of our EHR systems do not meet these\nstandards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive\nfederal incentive payments, we may be\n37\nexposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse\nlaws, including the False Claims Act.\nWhile we\nbelieve we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable\nfraud and abuse laws and\nregulations and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls\nin place to ensure substantial compliance,\nwe cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or resulting changes in our, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers and comply with evolving legal requirements, our products\nmay need to\nincorporate increasingly complex functionality, such as with respect to reporting and information blocking.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve\nincreased costs, and our failure to\nimplement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards,\ncould have a material adverse effect on\nour business.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the\nability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged\ninformation becomes\nincreasingly important.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with\nan electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as\nforeign jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed\nthat could materially\nadversely affect our tax positions.\nThere can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be\nmaterially\nadversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations.\nAlthough we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and\nconsistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent,\nthere can be no assurance that our tax positions\nwill not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful\nin any such challenge.\nWe face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the\nevent that the use of the products we sell results in injury.\nOur business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant\nin cases as a result of our distribution of\nproducts.\nAdditionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products.\nAs a result, we\ncould be subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating\nto the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities.\nIn addition, as our corporate brand business\ncontinues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the\nultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims.\nAnother potential risk we face in the distribution of our\nproducts is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating\nthe supply chain.\nIn addition, some of\nthe products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials.\nThe improper handling of such\nmaterials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could\nsubject us to liability or at least legal\naction that could harm our reputation.\nCustoms policies or legislative import restrictions could hinder the Company’s ability to import goods necessary\nto our operations on a timely basis and result in government enforcement\nactions and/or sanctions.\nGovernment-imposed import policies and legislation regulating the\nimport of goods and prohibiting the use of\nforced labor or human trafficking could result in delays or the inability to import\ngoods in a timely manner that are\nnecessary to our operations, and such policies or legislation could also\nresult in financial penalties, other sanctions,\ngovernment enforcement actions and reputational harm.\nWhile the Company has policies against and seeks to\navoid the import of goods that are manufactured in whole or in part by forced\nlabor or through human trafficking,\nas a result of legislative and governmental policy initiatives, we may be subject\nto increasing potential delays,\nadded costs, supply chain disruption and other restrictions.\n38\nGENERAL RISKS\nSecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our\ntechnology products and services could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected if\nsuch products, services or systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are\ninterrupted, damaged by unforeseen\nevents, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period\nof time.\nWe rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store customer,\nproduct, supplier and employee data to, among other things:\n•\nmaintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and\ndistribution of thousands of\ninventory items from numerous distribution centers;\n•\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n•\nmanage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of\ncustomers;\n•\nprocess payments to suppliers; and\n•\nprovide products and services that maintain certain of our customers’ electronic\nmedical or dental\nrecords (including protected health information of their patients).\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack\nthat bypasses our IS security\nsystems (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach\nmay lead to a material disruption\nof our IS business systems (including third-party systems we rely on) and/or\nthe loss of business information, as\nwell as claims against us by affected parties and/or governmental agencies, and involve\nfines and penalties, costs\nfor remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.\nIn addition, we develop products and provide\nservices to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack\nthat bypasses the IS security systems of our\nproducts or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security\nvulnerabilities in our products or services\ncould also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm, and actual\nor perceived vulnerabilities may lead\nto claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.\nIn particular, certain of our practice\nmanagement products and services purchased by health care providers, such\nas physicians and dentists, are used to\nstore and manage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers are subject to laws and regulations which\nrequire that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our\nproducts may be used as part of these\ncustomers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection\nwith their efforts to comply with\napplicable privacy and security laws.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services,\nor the\nperceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products\nto comply with applicable legal\nrequirements, may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business,\nbut may also lead to claims against us by\nour customers and/or governmental agencies and involve damages, fines and\npenalties, costs for remediation, and\nsubstantial defense and settlement expenses.\nIn addition, a cyberattack on a third-party that we use to manage\na\nportion of our information systems could result in the same effects.\nAdditionally, legislative or regulatory action\nrelated to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement\nnew technology products and services.\nFrom time to time, we have had to address immaterial security incidents\n(“security incidents”).\nThere can be no\nassurance that we will not experience material security incidents in the future. Security\nincidents can be difficult to\ndetect and any delay in identifying them could increase their harm.\nWhile we have implemented measures to\nprotect our IS systems, such measures may not prevent these events.\nAny such security incidents could disrupt our\noperations, harm our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nWe have various\ninsurance policies, including cybersecurity insurance, covering risks and\nin amounts that we consider adequate.\nThere can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or\nwill be available in adequate\namounts or at a reasonable cost to cover costs and expenses related\nto security incidents.\nFurthermore, procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new\nIS challenges, and enhancing\nprotections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional\ncosts on us.\nFinally, our business may be interrupted by shortfalls of IS systems providers engaged by our customers, such\nas\nInternet-based services upon which our customers depend to access certain of\nour products.\n39\nOur global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely\naffect our business.\nOur global operations are subject to risks that could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe risks that our\nglobal operations are subject to include, among other things:\n•\ndifficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;\n•\ndifficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products, establishing channels of distribution\nand contract\nmanufacturing in foreign markets;\n•\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies (including, without limitation,\nin connection with\nBrexit);\n•\nuncertainties relating to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020, which\nwent\ninto effect in 2021, including for example potential implementation issues, potential\ndisputes over the\ninterpretation of the provisions of the Agreement and possible changes\nto the Agreement restricting the\nfree movement of goods between the U.K. and the European Union;\n•\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables\nin foreign\njurisdictions;\n•\nrepatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;\n•\nregulatory requirements, including,\nwithout limitation, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining\nto the accuracy of our internal books and records;\n•\nlitigation risks, new or unanticipated litigation developments and\nthe status of litigation matters;\n•\nunexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products and import/export\ntariffs, quotas,\nsanctions or penalties;\n•\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n•\nunexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;\n•\nchanges in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;\n•\ncivil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political\nor military coups;\n•\nrisks associated with climate change, including physical risks such as\nimpacts from extreme weather\nevents and other potential physical consequences, regulatory and technological\nrequirements, market\ndevelopments, stakeholder expectations and reputational risk; and\n•\npublic health emergencies, including COVID-19.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior\nmanagement, and our revenues and profitability\ndepend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as\ncustomers, suppliers and manufacturers of\nthe products that we distribute.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members\nof our existing senior\nmanagement, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nThe loss of the services of\nMr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr.\nBergman.\nWe do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees.\nCompetition for\nsenior management is intense, burnout and turn-over rates are increasing workplace\nconcerns during and after the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and we may not be successful in attracting and\nretaining key personnel.\nAdditionally, our\nfuture revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory\nrelationships with qualified sales\npersonnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers.\nIf we fail to maintain our existing relationships with\nsuch persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the\nfuture, our business may be materially\nadversely affected.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability\nand cost of credit to us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with\nrespect to indebtedness will depend on\nour operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing\neconomic conditions and financial,\nbusiness and other factors beyond our control.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect\nthe availability and cost of credit to us.\n40"

as\nrequired by law.\nWhere You\nCan Find Important Information\nWe may disclose important information through one or more of the following channels: SEC filings, public\nconference calls and webcasts, press releases, the investor relations\npage of our website (www.henryschein.com)\nand the social media channels identified on the Newsroom page of our website.\nRecent Developments\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created\nsignificant volatility and disruption of global financial markets in\n2020 and 2021.\nThe impact of COVID-19 had a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows in 2020.\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 25, 2021, patient traffic levels returned to levels approaching pre-pandemic\nlevels.\nDemand for dental\nproducts and certain medical products throughout 2021 was driven\nby sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 we experienced a decrease\nin the sales volume of PPE and COVID-19\ntest kits.\nThe volatility in sales of COVID-19 test kits has moderated, albeit at a significantly\nlower level of sales\ncompared with 2021, resulting in us recording an inventory obsolescence\nreserve of $17 million for COVID-19 test\nkits during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWhile the U.S. economy has recently experienced inflationary\npressures and strengthening of the U.S dollar, their\nimpacts have not been material to our results of operations in the\nfourth quarter or full year ended December 31,\n2022, and we currently expect moderating of inflation and foreign currency\nfluctuations.\nThough inflation impacts\nboth our revenues and costs, the depth and breadth of our product portfolio\noften allows us to offer lower-cost\nnational brand solutions or corporate brand alternatives to our more\nprice-sensitive customers who are unable to\nabsorb price increases, thus positioning us to protect our gross profit.\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions\nmade by us that affect, among other things,\nour goodwill, long-lived asset and definite-lived intangible asset valuation;\ninventory valuation; equity investment\nvaluation; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income\ntaxes and income tax\ncontingencies; the allowance for doubtful accounts; hedging activity; supplier\nrebates; measurement of\ncompensation cost for certain share-based performance awards and cash\nbonus plans; and pension plan\nassumptions.\nDue to the significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact\nof COVID-19, our judgments\nregarding estimates and impairments could change in the future.\nThere is an ongoing risk that the COVID-19\npandemic may again have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand cash flows and may\nresult in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nHowever, the extent of the potential\nimpact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n45\nExecutive-Level Overview\nHenry Schein, Inc. is a solutions company for health care professionals powered\nby a network of people and\ntechnology.\nWe believe we are the world’s\nlargest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-\nbased dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care.\nWe\nserve more than one million customers\nworldwide including dental practitioners, laboratories, physician practices, and\nambulatory surgery centers, as well\nas government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.\nWe\nbelieve that we have a strong\nbrand identity due to our more than 90 years of experience distributing health\ncare products.\nWe are headquartered in Melville, New York,\nemploy approximately 22,000 people (of which approximately\n10,700 are based outside of the United States) and have operations or\naffiliates in 32 countries and territories.\nOur\nbroad global footprint has evolved over time through our organic success as well as\nthrough contribution from\nstrategic acquisitions.\nWe\nhave established strategically located distribution centers around\nthe world to enable us to better serve our\ncustomers and increase our operating efficiency.\nThis infrastructure, together with broad product and service\nofferings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables\nus to be a single source of\nsupply for our customers’ needs.\nWhile our primary go-to-market strategy is in our capacity as a distributor, we also market and sell under\nour own\ncorporate brand portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable merchandise products,\nand manufacture certain\ndental specialty products in the areas of implants, orthodontics and endodontics.\nWe\nhave achieved scale in these\nglobal businesses primarily through acquisitions as manufacturers of these\nproducts typically do not utilize a\ndistribution channel to serve customers.\nWe\nconduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health\ncare distribution and (ii) technology and\nvalue-added services.\nThese segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.\nOur global\ndental businesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools, government\nand other\ninstitutions.\nOur medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent care centers, ambulatory care sites, emergency\nmedical technicians, dialysis centers, home health, federal and state governments\nand large enterprises, such as\ngroup practices and integrated delivery networks, among other providers\nacross a wide range of specialties.\nThe health care distribution reportable segment, combining our global dental and\nmedical operating segments,\ndistributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment\nrepair services,\nbranded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, dental specialty\nproducts (including implant,\northodontic and endodontic products), diagnostic tests, infection-control products,\nPPE products and vitamins.\nOur global technology and value-added services business provides software, technology\nand other value-added\nservices to health care practitioners.\nOur technology business offerings include practice management software\nsystems for dental and medical practitioners.\nOur value-added practice solutions include practice consultancy,\neducation, revenue cycle management and financial services on a non-recourse\nbasis, e-services, practice\ntechnology, network and hardware services, as well as consulting, and continuing education services for\npractitioners.\nA key element to grow closer to our customers is our One Schein initiative, which\nis a unified go-to-market\napproach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with our supply chain,\nequipment sales and service and\nother value-added services, allowing our customers to leverage the\ncombined value that we offer through a single\nprogram.\nSpecifically, One Schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of\nnational brand products, our corporate brand products and proprietary specialty\nproducts and solutions (including\nimplant, orthodontic and endodontic products).\nIn addition, customers have access to a wide range of services,\nincluding software and other value-added services.\n46\nIndustry Overview\nIn recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.\nThis trend has benefited\ndistributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low\nprices.\nIt also has accelerated the\ngrowth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying\ngroups, which, in addition to\ntheir emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors\ncapable of providing\nspecialized management information support.\nWe\nbelieve that the trend towards cost containment has the potential\nto favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can\nenhance the efficiency and\nfacilitation of practice management.\nOur operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies\nand transactions that we\nundertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the\nhealth care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends\ntoward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.\nOur current and future results have been and could be impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic, the current economic\nenvironment and continued economic and public health uncertainty.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in\nearly 2020, we have been carefully monitoring its impact on our global\noperations and have taken appropriate steps\nto minimize the risk to our employees.\nWe\nhave seen and expect to continue to see changes in demand trends\nfor\nsome of our products and services, supply chain challenges and labor\nchallenges, as rates of infection fluctuate, new\nstrains or variants of COVID-19 emerge and spread, governments adapt their approaches\nto combatting the virus,\nand local conditions change across geographies.\nAs a result, we expect to see continued volatility.\nIndustry Consolidation\nThe health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented\nand diverse.\nThe industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of\nrelatively small offices to group practices\nor service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have\ncombined or otherwise associated their practices.\nDue in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage\nlarge quantities of supplies\nin their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health\ncare practitioners\nhas been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid,\nreliable and substantially complete\norder fulfillment.\nThe purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically\nmade by the\npractitioner or an administrative assistant.\nSupplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more\nthan\none distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.\nThe trend of consolidation extends to our customer base.\nHealth care practitioners are increasingly seeking to\npartner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician\nhospital organizations.\nIn many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups\nare made at a centralized or\nprofessional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices.\nWe\nbelieve that consolidation within the industry will continue to\nresult in a number of distributors, particularly\nthose with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to\ncombine with larger companies that can\nprovide growth opportunities.\nThis consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking\nto acquire\ncompanies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide\nopportunities to serve a broader\ncustomer base.\nOur approach to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as\na provider of products and services\nto the health care industry.\nThis trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement\nour existing\noperations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired\nbusinesses.\nAs industry\nconsolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize\non this trend, as we believe we\nhave the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure, although\nthere can be no assurances\nthat we will be able to successfully accomplish this.\nWe\nalso have invested in expanding our sales/marketing\n47\ninfrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision\nmakers who do not reside in the office-\nbased practitioner setting.\nAs the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible\ncandidates for joint venture or\nacquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our\nrole as a provider of products and services to\nthe health care industry.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue\nany such\nopportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.\nIf additional transactions are entered into or\nconsummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there\ncan be no assurance that the\nintegration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.\nAging Population and Other Market Influences\nThe health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth\ndue to the aging population,\nincreased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology\nand testing, new pharmacology treatments,\nand expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance\ncoverage.\nIn addition, the physician market continues to benefit from\nthe shift of procedures and diagnostic testing\nfrom acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’\noffices.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, between 2022 and 2032, the 45 and older\npopulation is expected to grow by approximately 11%.\nBetween 2022 and 2042, this age group is expected to grow\nby approximately 21%.\nThis compares with expected total U.S. population growth\nrates of approximately 6%\nbetween 2022 and 2032 and approximately 12% between 2022 and 2042.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, in 2022 there are approximately seven million\nAmericans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care\nand elder-care\nservices.\nBy the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately\n19 million.\nThe population\naged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 27% during\nthe same period.\nAs a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care services\ncontinue to increase in the\nUnited States.\nWe believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by\ncurrent and future operating, economic, and industry conditions.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\nor CMS, published “National Health Expenditure Data” indicating\nthat total national health care spending reached\napproximately $4.3 trillion in 2021, or 18.3% of the nation’s gross domestic product, the benchmark\nmeasure for\nannual production of goods and services in the United States.\nHealth care spending is projected to reach\napproximately $6.2 trillion in 2028, or 19.7% of the nation’s projected gross domestic product.\nGovernment\nOur businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could\nimpact our financial performance,\nand failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nSee “\n” for a discussion of laws, regulations and governmental activity\nthat may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n48\nResults of Operations\nRefer to Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in\nour 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results\nof operations for the fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020.\nThe following tables summarize the significant components of our operating\nresults and cash flows from continuing\noperations:\nYears\nEnded\nDecember 31,\nDecember 25,\nDecember 26,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nOperating results:\nNet sales\n$\n12,647\n$\n12,401\n$\n10,119\nCost of

and\nstreamlining operations and other initiatives to increase efficiency.\nWe expect this initiative to extend through\n2023.\nWe are currently unable in good faith to make a determination of an estimate of the amount or range of\namounts expected to be incurred in connection with these activities, both with\nrespect to each major type of cost\nassociated therewith and with respect to the total cost, or an estimate of the\namount or range of amounts that will\nresult in future cash expenditures.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded restructuring charges of $128\nmillion primarily related to\nseverance and employee-related costs, accelerated amortization of right-of-use\nlease assets, impairment of other\nlong-lived assets and lease exit costs.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, in connection with our restructuring\nplan, we vacated one of\nthe buildings at our corporate headquarters in Melville NY, which resulted in an accelerated amortization of right-\nof-use lease asset of $34 million.\nWe also initiated the disposal of a non-profitable US business and recorded\nrelated costs of $49 million which primarily consisted of impairment of\nintangible assets and goodwill, inventory\nimpairment, and severance and employee-related costs.\nThese expenses are included in the $128 million of\nrestructuring charges discussed above.\nThe disposal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023.\nOn August 26, 2022, we acquired Midway Dental Supply.\nIn connection with this acquisition, during the year\nended December 31, 2022, we recorded integration costs of $3 million related\nto one-time employee and other\ncosts, as well as restructuring charges of $9 million, which are included in the\n$128 million of restructuring charges\ndiscussed above.\nOn November 20, 2019, we committed to a contemplated restructuring\ninitiative intended to mitigate stranded costs\nassociated with the spin-off of our animal health business and to rationalize operations\nand provide expense\nefficiencies.\nThese activities were originally expected to be completed by\nthe end of 2020 but we extended them to\nthe end of 2021 in light of the changes to the business environment brought\non by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe\nrestructuring activities under this prior initiative were completed\nin 2021.\n50\n2022 Compared

net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 2.0% based\nupon the components presented in the\ntable above.\nWe estimate that sales for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits\nwere approximately $1,245 million, an estimated decrease of 34.7% versus the prior\nyear.\nExcluding PPE products\nand COVID-19 test kits,\nthe estimated increase in internally generated local currency sales was 6.7%.\nDental\nDental net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased 0.9% based\nupon the components presented in the\ntable above.\nOur sales growth in local currency for dental merchandise decreased\nprimarily due to a decrease in\nPPE product sales.\nWe estimate that global dental sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 of PPE products\nwere approximately $447 million, an estimated decrease of 32.5% versus the prior\nyear.\nExcluding PPE products,\nthe estimated increase in internally generated local currency dental sales\nwas 3.8%.\nDental equipment sales in local\ncurrency increased in both our North American and international markets,\nprimarily due to increased demand.\n51\nMedical\nMedical net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 5.7% based\nupon the components presented in\nthe table above.\nGlobally, we estimate our medical business recorded sales of approximately $798 million of\nsales\nof PPE products\nand COVID-19 test kits for the year ended December 31, 2022, an estimated\ndecrease of\napproximately 27.4% compared to the prior year.\nExcluding PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, the estimated\nincrease in internally generated local currency medical sales was\n2.1%.\nTe\nchnology and value-added services\nTechnology and value-added services net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 11.8% based upon\nthe components presented in the table above.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the trend for transactional\nsoftware sales improved as we increased the number of users, generating demand\nfor our sales cycle management\nsolutions, and also from cloud-based solutions that drive practice efficiency and patient engagement.\nGross Profit\nGross profit and gross margin percentages by segment and in total were as follows:\nGross\nGross\nIncrease\n2022\nMargin %\n2021\nMargin %\n$\n%\nHealth care distribution\n$\n3,357\n28.2\n%\n$\n3,239\n27.6\n%\n$\n118\n3.6\n%\nTechnology and value-added services\n474\n65.5\n435\n67.2\n39\n9.0\nTotal\n$\n3,831\n30.3\n$\n3,674\n29.6\n$\n157\n4.3\nAs a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks\nthroughout our\nindustry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.\nAdditionally, we\nrealize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology and value-added services\nsegment than in\nour health care distribution segment.\nThese higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of\nsoftware products and services, as well as certain financial services.\nThe software industry typically realizes higher\ngross margins to recover investments in research and development.\nWithin our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary from one period to the next.\nChanges in\nthe mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer mix have\nbeen the most significant drivers affecting\nour gross profit margin.\nFor example, sales of our corporate brand products achieve\ngross profit margins that are\nhigher than average total gross profit margins of all products.\nWith respect to customer mix, sales to our large-\ngroup customers are typically completed at lower gross margins due to the higher\nvolumes sold as opposed to the\ngross margin on sales to office-based practitioners, who normally purchase lower volumes.\nHealth care distribution gross profit increased primarily due to the increase\nin net sales discussed above.\nThe\noverall increase in our health care distribution gross profit was attributable to\n$67 million of gross profit from\nacquisitions and gross margin expansion, mainly as a result of increased sales\nmix of higher-margin products.\nTechnology and value-added services gross profit increased as a result of an increase in gross profit from internally\ngenerated sales and gross profit from acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in\ngross margin rates.\nGross\nmargin rates decreased primarily due to lower gross margins of recently acquired companies in\nthe business\nservices sector and our continued investment in product development and customer\nservice.\n52\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative\nexpenses; depreciation and amortization,\nrestructuring and integration costs) by segment and in total were as follows:\n% of\n%

amortization of right-of-use lease assets related\nto the exit from one of the properties at our\ncorporate headquarters, severance costs, and other costs relating to\nthe exit of some facilities.\nThe increase in\noperating costs includes a $20 million intangible assets impairment charge within\nour health care distribution\nsegment, and increases in payroll and payroll related costs and travel and convention\nexpenses in both of our\nreportable segments.\nWhile the U.S. economy has recently experienced inflationary\npressures and strengthening of\nthe U.S dollar, their impacts have not been material to our results of operations.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net was as follows:\nVariance\n2022\n2021\n$\n%\nInterest

due to increased interest rates.\nInterest expense increased primarily due to\nincreased borrowings and increased interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 23.8%\nfor the prior year\nperiod.\nIn 2022, the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate primarily\nrelates to\nstate and foreign income taxes and interest expense.\nIn 2021, the difference between our effective tax rate and the\nfederal statutory tax rate was primarily due to state and foreign income\ntaxes and interest expense.\nGain on Sale of Equity Investment\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we received contingent proceeds of $10 million\nfrom the 2019 sale of Hu-Friedy\nresulting in the recognition of an additional after-tax gain of $7\nmillion.\nNo further proceeds are expected from this\nsale.\n53\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions, purchases\nof additional noncontrolling\ninterests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs,\npurchases of fixed assets and\nrepurchases of common stock.\nWorking capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special\ninventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables\nand payables.\nHistorically, sales have\ntended to be stronger during the second half of the year and special inventory\nforward buy-in opportunities have\nbeen most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements\nto be higher\nfrom the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of\nthe following year.\nWe finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt\nplacements.\nPlease see\nfor further information.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flows from\noperations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for our\nproducts and services, and access to\nproducts and services from our suppliers.\nOur business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which\nis susceptible to fluctuations during the\nyear as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.\nInventory purchase activity is a function of\nsales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.\nWe anticipate\nfuture increases in our working capital requirements.\nWe finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.\nFunding requirements are based on\nforecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may\nchange.\nConsequently, we may change\nour funding structure to reflect any new requirements.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets,\nand our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with\nsufficient liquidity to meet our currently\nforeseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $602 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, compared to net\ncash from continuing operations provided by operating activities of $710 million\nfor the prior year.\nThe net change\nof $108 million was primarily due to unfavorable net cash used by our working\ncapital accounts, net of\nacquisitions, driven by an impact of timing of payments which\nresulted in an increase in other current assets and\nrelative decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by the\nrelative year over year impact\nof inventory increases (2021 increase was more significant than the\n2022 increase).\nNet cash used in investing activities was $276 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022, compared to $677\nmillion for the prior year.\nThe net change of $401 million was primarily attributable to decreased payments\nfor\nequity investments and business acquisitions.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $315 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash\nused in financing activities of $333 million for the prior year.\nThe net change of $18 million was primarily due to\nincreased net borrowings from debt, partially offset by increased repurchases of common\nstock.\n54\nThe following table summarizes selected measures of

liquidity.\nAccounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns\nOur accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations\nincreased to 41.9 days as of December 31, 2022\nfrom 41.8 days as of December 25, 2021.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and December\n25, 2021, we\nwrote off approximately $10 million and $8 million, respectively, of fully reserved accounts receivable against our\ntrade receivable reserve.\nOur inventory turns from operations was 4.7 as of December\n31, 2022 and 5.2 as of\nDecember 25, 2021.\nOur working capital accounts may be impacted

office space, distribution and other facilities, vehicles\nand certain equipment.\nOur leases have remaining terms of less than one year to approximately\n19 years, some of\nwhich may include options to extend the leases for up to 15 years.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our right-of-use\nassets related to operating leases were $284 million and our current and non-current\noperating lease liabilities were\n$73 million and $275 million, respectively.\nPlease see\nfor further information.\nStock Repurchases\nOn March 8, 2021, we announced the reinstatement of our share repurchase\nprogram, which had been temporarily\nsuspended in April of 2020.\nFrom March 3, 2003 through December 31, 2022, we repurchased $4.5\nbillion, or 87,180,669 shares, under our\ncommon stock repurchase programs, with $115 million available as of December 31, 2022 for future\ncommon stock\nshare repurchases.\nOn February 8, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase\nof up to an additional $400 million in shares\nof our common stock.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nSome minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have\nthe right, at certain times, to require us\nto acquire their ownership interest in those entities.\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480-10 is\napplicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required\nto purchase all or a portion of the\noutstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling\ninterest holder under the terms of a put\noption contained in contractual agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, our balance\nfor\nredeemable noncontrolling interests was $576 million and $613 million, respectively.\nPlease see\nfor further information.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs more fully disclosed in\nof “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” we cannot\nreasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized\ntax benefits, including accrued\ninterest, of $94 million as of December 31, 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in\nof the consolidated financial statements.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us\nto make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues\nand expenses and\nrelated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\nWe base our estimates on historical data, when available,\nexperience, industry and market trends, and on various other assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the combined results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nWe believe that the estimates, judgments and\nassumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information\navailable to us at the time that these\nestimates, judgments and assumptions are made.\nHowever, by their nature, estimates are subject to various\nassumptions and uncertainties.\nTherefore, reported results may differ from estimates and any such differences may\nbe material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting estimates, which have been discussed with the Audit Committee\nof our Board of Directors, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in\nthe preparation of our financial\nstatements:\n56\nInventories and Reserves\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost is\ndetermined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost\nfor large equipment and high tech\nequipment.\nIn estimating carrying value of inventory, we consider many factors including the condition and\nsalability of the inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, historical sales,\nforecasted sales and market and\neconomic trends.\nCertain of our products, specifically PPE and COVID-19 test kits, have experienced\nchanges in\nnet realizable value, due to volatility of pricing and changes in demand\nfor these products.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe estimated fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets (trademarks\nand trade names, customer\nrelationships and lists, non-compete agreements and product development)\nis based on critical estimates, judgments\nand assumptions derived from: analysis of market conditions; discount\nrates; projected cash flows; customer\nretention rates; and estimated useful lives.\nPlease see\nfor further\ndiscussion of our acquisitions.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is subject to impairment analysis at least once annually as of\nthe first day of our fourth quarter, or if an\nevent occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than\nnot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit\nbelow its carrying value.\nSuch impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of\nthe fair value to the\ncarrying value of reporting units.\nWe regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: global dental,\nglobal\nmedical, and technology and value-added services.\nGoodwill is allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes\nof preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification\nbasis.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\nthe identification of reporting units,\nassignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services\nto the reporting units, and ultimately the\ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit is calculated by\napplying the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with\na market approach.\nThere are inherent\nuncertainties, however, related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgments in applying them\nto this analysis.\nThe most significant inputs include estimation of detailed future cash flows based\non budget expectations, and\ndetermination of comparable companies to develop a weighted average\ncost of capital for each reporting unit.\nOn an annual basis, we prepare annual and\nmedium-term financial projections.\nThese projections are based on\ninput from our leadership and are presented annually to our Board of Directors.\nInfluences on this year's forecasted\nfinancial information and the fair value model include: the impact of planned\nstrategic initiatives, the continued\nintegration of recent acquisitions and overall market conditions.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a\nreporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,\nmarket conditions, and other factors.\nOur third-party valuation specialists provide inputs into our determination\nof the discount rate.\nThe rate is\ndependent on a number of underlying assumptions, including the risk-free rate,\ntax rate, equity risk premium, debt\nto equity ratio\nand pre-tax cost of debt.\nLong-term growth rates are applied to our estimation of future cash flows.\nThe long-term growth rates are tied to\ngrowth rates we expect to achieve beyond the years for which we have\nforecasted operating results.\nWe also\nconsider external benchmarks, and other data points which we believe are\napplicable to our industry and the\ncomposition of our global operations.\nBased on our quantitative assessment for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwe recorded a $20 million impairment\nof goodwill relating to the disposal of an unprofitable business whose\nestimated fair value was lower than its\ncarrying value.\nAs part of our analysis for the rest of the goodwill balance,\nwe performed a sensitivity analysis on\nthe discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions.\nThe sensitivities did not result in any additional\nimpairment charges.\n57\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAnnually, definite-lived intangible assets such as non-compete agreements, trademarks, trade names, customer\nrelationships and lists, and product development are reviewed for impairment\nindicators.\nIf any impairment\nindicators exist, quantitative testing is performed on the asset.\nThe quantitative impairment model is a two-step test under which we\nfirst calculate the recoverability of the\ncarrying value by comparing the undiscounted, probability-weighted value\nof the projected cash flows associated\nwith the asset or asset group, including its estimated residual value, to\nthe carrying amount.\nIf the cash flows\nassociated with the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value,\nwe would perform a fair value assessment\nof the asset, or asset group.\nIf the carrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value, we record an\nimpairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value.\nIn addition, in all cases of an impairment review,\nwe re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them,\nas appropriate.\nAlthough we believe our\njudgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in estimating cash flows\nand determining fair value are reasonable,\nmaking material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or assumptions\ncould materially affect such impairment\nanalyses and our financial results.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021\nand December 26, 2020, we recorded total\nimpairment charges on intangible assets of approximately $49 million ($34 million\nrelated to impairment of\ncustomer lists and relationships attributable to customer attrition rates being higher\nthan expected in certain\nbusinesses and $15 million due to the disposal of an unprofitable\nbusiness), $1 million and $20 million,\nrespectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 impairment charges were recorded\nwithin our health care\ndistribution segment.\nFor the years ended December 25, 2021 and December 26,\n2020, impairment charges were\nrecorded within our health care distribution and technology and value-added services\nsegments.\nIncome Tax\nWhen determining if the realization of the deferred tax asset is likely by assessing\nthe need for a valuation\nallowance, estimates and judgement are required.\nWe\nconsider all available evidence, both positive and negative,\nincluding estimated future taxable earnings, ongoing planning strategies,\nfuture reversals of existing temporary\ndifferences and historical operating results.\nAdditionally, changes to tax laws and statutory tax rates can have an\nimpact on our determination.\nOur intention is to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in\naccordance with other provisions contained within this guidance.\nThis topic prescribes a recognition threshold and\na measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement\nof tax positions taken or expected\nto be taken in a tax return.\nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely\nthan not to be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nThe amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of\nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate\naudit settlement.\nIn the normal course of\nbusiness, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing\nauthorities.\nSuch examinations may result in\nfuture tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain\ntax positions taken in respect of certain\ntax matters.\nPlease see\nfor further discussion.\nThe FASB Staff Q&A, Topic\n740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), states\nthat an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred\ntaxes for temporary differences\nexpected to reverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is\nincurred.\nWe elected to recognize the tax on GILTI\nas a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.\nAccounting Standards Update\nFor a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted\nor will be adopted in the future, please see\nincluded under Item 8.\n58"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S.\ndollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.\nWe attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using\nforeign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.\nThese hedging activities provide\nonly limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.\nFactors that could influence the effectiveness of\nour hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging\ninstruments and liquidity of the credit\nmarkets.\nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components\nof hedging programs and are\nentered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated\ncurrency exposure.\nWe do not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying\nour investments, maintaining a\nstrong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital.\nForeign Currency Agreements\nThe value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar\nand the value of certain underlying functional\ncurrencies of the Company, including its foreign subsidiaries, may affect our financial results.\nFluctuations in\nexchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses\nand retained\nearnings, all of which are\nexpressed in U.S. dollars.\nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs\nusing primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting\nthe impact of foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations on earnings.\nWe purchase short-term (i.e., generally 18 months or less) foreign currency forward\ncontracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany\nloans due from our international\nsubsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign\nsuppliers.\nWe do not hedge the translation of\nforeign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting\nexposure, not an economic\nexposure.\nA hypothetical 5% change in the average value of the U.S. dollar\nin 2022 compared to foreign currencies\nwould have changed our 2022 reported Net income attributable to Henry\nSchein, Inc. by approximately $7 million.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had forward foreign currency exchange\nagreements, which expire through November\n16, 2023, with a fair value of $23 million as determined by quoted market\nprices.\nIncluded in the forward foreign\ncurrency exchange agreements, Henry Schein, Inc. had net investment\ndesignated EUR/USD forward contracts\nwith notional values of approximately €200 million, with a reported fair value\nof these contracts of $20 million.\nA\n5% increase in the value of the Euro to the USD from December 31, 2022,\nwith all other variables held constant,\nwould have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these forward contracts\nby decreasing the value of these\ninstruments by $10 million.\nTotal\nReturn Swaps\nOn March 20, 2020, we entered into a total return swap for the purpose\nof economically hedging our unfunded non-\nqualified supplemental retirement plan (“SERP”) and our deferred compensation\nplan (“DCP”).\nThis swap will\noffset changes in our SERP and DCP liabilities.\nAt the inception, the notional value of the investments in these\nplans was $43 million.\nAt December 31, 2022, the notional value of the investments\nin these plans was $78\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2022, the financing blended rate for\nthis swap was based on LIBOR of 4.03% plus\n0.55%, for a combined rate of 4.58%.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 ended and December\n25, 2021, we\nhave recorded a gain/(loss), within the selling, general and administrative\nline item in our consolidated statement of\nincome, of approximately $(17) million and $12 million, respectively, net of transaction costs, related to this\nundesignated swap.\nThis swap is expected to be renewed on an annual basis after its current\nexpiration date of\nMarch 31, 2023, and is expected to result in a neutral impact to our results\nof operations.\nShort-Term Investments\nWe limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments, by\nmonitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are\nthe counterparties to such financial\ninstruments.\nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing\nnumerous investment grade counterparties.\n59\nVariable\nInterest Rate Debt\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had variable interest rate exposure for certain\nof our revolving credit facilities and\nour U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization.\nOur revolving credit facility which we entered into on August 20, 2021\nand expires on August 20, 2026, has an\ninterest rate that is based on the U.S. Dollar LIBOR plus a spread based on\nour leverage ratio at the end of each\nfinancial reporting quarter.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $0 million outstanding under this\nrevolving credit\nfacility.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings under\nthis revolving credit facility.\nOur U.S trade accounts receivable securitization, which we entered\ninto on April 17, 2013 and expires on\nDecember 15, 2025, has an interest rate that is based upon the asset-backed\ncommercial paper rate.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022, the commercial paper rate was 4.58% plus 0.75%,\nfor a combined rate of 5.33%.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2022 the outstanding balance was $330 million under\nthis securitization facility.\nDuring the year\nended December 31, 2022, the average outstanding balance under this securitization\nfacility was approximately\n$166 million.\nBased upon our average outstanding balance for this securitization\nfacility, for each hypothetical\nincrease of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder would have\nincreased by $0.4 million.\n60"

to\ndirect activities that most significantly affect the economic performance and have\nthe obligation to absorb the\nmajority of the losses or benefits.\nFor this VIE, the trade accounts receivable transferred to the VIE are\npledged as\ncollateral to the related debt.\nThe creditors have recourse to us for losses on these trade accounts receivable.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, certain trade accounts receivable that\ncan only be used to settle\nobligations of this VIE were $\n327\nmillion and $\n138\nmillion, respectively, and the liabilities of this VIE where the\ncreditors have recourse to us were $\n255\nmillion and $\n105\nmillion, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United\nStates requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) a\npandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and\ncreated significant volatility and disruption\nof global financial markets.\nIn response, many countries implemented\nbusiness closures and restrictions, stay-at-home and social distancing ordinances\nand similar measures to combat\nthe pandemic, which significantly impacted global business and dramatically\nreduced demand for dental products\nand certain medical products in the second quarter of 2020.\nDemand for these non-PPE products increased in the\nsecond half of 2020 and continued throughout the years ended December 25,\n2021 and December 31, 2022,\nresulting in growth over the prior years.\nDemand for PPE products declined during the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2022.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n69\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions\nmade by us that affect, among other things,\nour goodwill, long-lived asset and definite-lived intangible asset valuation;\ninventory valuation; equity investment\nvaluation; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income\ntaxes and income tax\ncontingencies; the allowance for doubtful accounts; hedging activity; supplier\nrebates; measurement of\ncompensation cost for certain share-based performance awards and cash bonus\nplans; and pension plan\nassumptions.\nDue to the significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact of\nCOVID-19, our judgments\nregarding estimates and impairments could change in the future.\nThere is an ongoing risk that the COVID-19\npandemic may again have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand cash flows and may\nresult in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nHowever, the extent of the potential\nimpact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nFiscal Year\nWe report our results of operations and cash flows on a\n52\n-\n53\nweek basis ending on the last Saturday of December.\nThe year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of\n53\nweeks, and the years ended, December 25, 2021 and December\n26, 2020 consisted of\n52\nweeks.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods\nor services in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration that we expect to receive for those goods or services.\nTo recognize revenue, we do the following:\n•\nidentify the contract(s) with a customer;\n•\nidentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermine the transaction price;\n•\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;\nand\n•\nrecognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of dental and medical consumable products, equipment (Health care distribution\nrevenues), software products and services and other sources (Technology and value-added services revenues).\nProvisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other\ncontra revenue adjustments are included\nin the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely\namount based upon historical data and\nestimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are\nrecognized.\nRevenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point\nin time when control transfers to the\ncustomer.\nSuch sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped\nusing third-party common carriers.\nWe believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the\ncustomer because we have no post-shipment obligations and this is when\nlegal title and risks and rewards of\nownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an\nenforceable right to payment.\nRevenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control\ntransfers to the customer.\nThis occurs\nwhen the equipment is delivered.\nSuch sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily\nby\nequipment service technicians.\nMost equipment requires minimal installation, which is\ntypically completed at the\ntime of delivery.\nOur product generally carries standard warranty terms provided\nby the manufacturer, however, in\ninstances where we provide warranty labor services, the warranty costs\nare accrued in accordance with Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 460 “Guarantees”.\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we had\naccrued approximately $\n8\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion, respectively, for warranty costs.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n70\nRevenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when\nproducts are delivered to customers or\nmade available electronically.\nSuch software is generally installed by customers and does not\nrequire extensive\ntraining due to the nature of its design.\nRevenue derived from post-contract customer support for software,\nincluding annual support and/or training, is generally recognized over\ntime using time elapsed as the input method\nthat best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.\nRevenue derived from software sold on Software-as-a -\nService basis is recognized ratably over the subscription period as\ncontrol is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue derived from other sources, including freight charges, equipment repairs\nand financial services, is\nrecognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when\nthe services are provided.\nWe apply the\npractical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after the\ncustomer obtains control as\nfulfillment activities, rather than a separate performance obligation in the\ncontract.\nSales, value-add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing\nactivities are excluded from\nrevenue.\nCertain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include\nmultiple distinct performance obligations,\nwhich are accounted for separately.\nWhen we sell software products together with related services (i.e.,\ntraining\nand technical support), we allocate revenue to software using the residual\nmethod, using an estimate of the\nstandalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered\nelements.\nBundled arrangements that include\nelements that are not considered software consist primarily of equipment\nand the related installation service.\nWe\nallocate revenue for such arrangements based on the relative selling\nprices of the goods or services.\nIf an\nobservable selling price is not available (i.e., we do not sell the goods or\nservices separately), we use one of the\nfollowing techniques to estimate the standalone selling price: adjusted\nmarket approach; cost-plus approach; or the\nresidual method.\nThere is no specific hierarchy for the use of these methods,\nbut the estimated selling price reflects\nour best estimate of what the selling prices of each deliverable would be\nif it were sold regularly on a standalone\nbasis taking into consideration the cost structure of our business, technical skill\nrequired, customer location and\nother market conditions.\nSee\nfor additional disclosures of disaggregated net sales and\nfor disclosures of net sales by segment and geographic data.\nSales Returns\nSales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount\nof expected returns and are recorded as refund\nliability within current liabilities.\nWe estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales\nreturn liability based on historical data for specific products, adjusted\nas necessary for new products.\nThe\nallowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we\nrecord an inventory asset (and a corresponding\nadjustment to cost of sales) for any products that we expect to be returned.\nCost of Sales\nThe primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product\n(net of purchase discounts, supplier\nchargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges.\nCosts related to purchasing, receiving, inspections, warehousing, internal\ninventory transfers and other costs of our\ndistribution network are included in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses along with other operating costs.\nTotal distribution network costs were $\n103\nmillion, $\n89\nmillion and $\n72\nmillion for the years ended December 31,\n2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n71\nSupplier Rebates\nSupplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized\nover the period they are earned.\nThe\nfactors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted\ninventory purchases and sales, in\nconjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally provide\nfor increasing rebates based on either\nincreased purchase or sales volume.\nDirect Shipping and Handling Costs\nFreight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.\nDirect handling costs, which represent\nprimarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise\nprepare, if necessary, merchandise\nfor shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\nDirect handling costs\nwere $\n96\nmillion, $\n97\nmillion and $\n79\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021\nand\nDecember 26, 2020.\nAdvertising and Promotional Costs\nWe generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.\nTotal advertising and promotional expenses\nwere $\n47\nmillion, $\n48\nmillion and $\n32\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021\nand\nDecember 26, 2020.\nStock Compensation Costs\nWe\nmeasure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated\nfair value of the award, and\nrecognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense on\na straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period for time-based restricted stock units and on a graded vesting\nbasis for the option awards.\nFor\nperformance-based awards, at each reporting date, we reassess whether achievement\nof the performance condition\nis probable and accrue compensation expense when achievement of\nthe performance condition is probable.\nOur\nstock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\nEmployment Benefit Plans and other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nCertain of our employees in our international markets participate\nin various noncontributory defined benefit plans.\nWe recognize the funded status, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit\nobligation, of each applicable plan, within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome in the consolidated balance\nsheets, whereby each unfunded plan is recognized as a liability and\neach funded plan is recognized as either an\nasset or liability based on its funded status.\nWe measure our plan assets and liabilities at the end of our fiscal year.\nNet periodic pension costs and valuations are dependent on assumptions\nused by third-party actuaries in calculating\nthose amounts.\nThese assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan\nassets, rate of future\ncompensation levels, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors.\nWe record the service cost component of\nnet pension cost in selling, general and administrative expenses within\nour consolidated statements of income.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents.\nDue to the short-term maturity of such investments,\nthe carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of\nfair value.\nOutstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $\n54\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion, primarily related to\npayments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n72\nContract Balances\nContract balances represent amounts presented in our consolidated balance\nsheets when either we have transferred\ngoods or services to the customer or the customer has paid consideration to us\nunder the contract.\nThese contract\nbalances include accounts receivable,\ncontract assets and contract liabilities.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are generally recognized when health care distribution\nand technology and value-added\nservices revenues are recognized.\nIn accordance with\nthe “expected credit loss” model, the carrying amount of\naccounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects\nour best estimate of the amounts that we do\nnot expect to collect.\nIn addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many\nfactors in\nestimating our reserve, including types of customers and their credit worthiness,\nexperience and historical data\nadjusted for current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts.\nWe\nrecord allowances for credit losses based upon a specific review of all\nsignificant outstanding invoices.\nFor\nthose invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates,\nbased upon the age of the\nreceivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region\nthat the receivable was recorded in, current\neconomic trends and reasonable supportable forecasts.\nWe\nwrite-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded\nallowance when we deem them uncollectible.\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts was $\n65\nmillion, $\n67\nmillion and $\n88\nmillion as of December 31, 2022,\nDecember 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively.\nAdditions to the allowance for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were $\n8\nmillion, $\n0\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion.\nDeductions to the allowance for the years ended December 31, 2022, December\n25, 2021 and December 26, 2020\nwere $\n10\nmillion, $\n21\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion.\nContract Assets\nContract assets include amounts related to any conditional right to consideration\nfor work completed but not billed\nas of the reporting date, and generally represent amounts owed to us by\ncustomers, but not yet billed.\nContract\nassets are transferred to accounts receivable when the right becomes unconditional.\nThe contract assets primarily\nrelate to our bundled arrangements for the sale of equipment and consumables\nand sales of term software licenses.\nCurrent contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other and the non-current\ncontract assets are included\nin investments and other within our consolidated balance sheets.\nCurrent and non-current contract asset balances as\nof December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were not material.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are comprised of advance payments and upfront payments\nfor service arrangements provided\nover time that are accounted for as deferred revenue amounts.\nContract liabilities are transferred to revenue once\nthe performance obligation has been satisfied.\nCurrent contract liabilities are included in accrued expenses: Other\nand the non-current contract liabilities are included in other liabilities\nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAt\nDecember 25, 2021, the current portion of contract liabilities of $\n89\nmillion was reported in accrued expenses:\nOther, and $\n10\nmillion related to non-current contract liabilities was reported\nin other liabilities.\nDuring the year\nended December 31, 2022,\nwe recognized substantially all of the current contract liability amounts\nthat were\npreviously deferred at December 25, 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022, the current and non-current portion of contract\nliabilities were $\n86\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion, respectively.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n73\nInventories and Reserves\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost is\ndetermined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost\nfor large equipment and high tech\nequipment.\nIn accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we\nconsider many factors including the\ncondition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.\nFrom\ntime to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any\nof these or other factors expected to affect\nthe value of inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or\namortization.\nDepreciation is\ncomputed primarily under the straight-line method\n(see\nfor estimated useful\nlives).\nAmortization of leasehold improvements is computed using\nthe straight-line method over the lesser of the\nuseful life of the assets or the lease term.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nCapitalized internal-use software costs consist of costs to purchase and\ndevelop software.\nFor software to be used\nsolely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver\nour services, we capitalize costs incurred\nduring the application development stage and include such costs within\nproperty and equipment, net within our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nFor software to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, we capitalize\nsoftware\ndevelopment costs when technological feasibility is reached and\ninclude such costs in Investments and other within\nour consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nWe\ndetermine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception.\nAn arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or\nexplicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control\nthe use of the identified asset in exchange\nfor consideration.\nAs a lessee, we include operating leases in operating lease right-of-use\n(“ROU”) assets,\noperating lease liabilities, and non-current operating lease liabilities in our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nFinance\nleases are included in property and equipment, current maturities\nof long-term debt, and long-term debt in our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease\nterm and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized\nupon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments\nover the lease term.\nAs most of\nour leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we generally use our incremental\nborrowing rate based on the\nestimated rate of interest for fully collateralized and fully amortizing borrowings\nover a similar term of the lease\npayments at commencement date to determine the present value of\nlease payments.\nWhen readily determinable, we\nuse the implicit rate.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably\ncertain that we will exercise that option.\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis\nover the lease term.\nExpenses associated with operating leases and finance leases\nare included in “selling, general\nand administrative”\nand “interest expense”, respectively within our consolidated statement\nof income.\nShort-term\nleases with a term of 12 months or less are not capitalized.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, December\n25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, such short-term lease expense was\n$\n7\nmillion, $\n4\nmillion, and $\n2\nmillion,\nrespectively.\nWe\nhave lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are\ngenerally accounted for as a single\nlease component, except non-lease components for leases of vehicles, which\nare accounted for separately.\nWhen a\nvehicle lease contains both lease and non-lease components, we allocate the\ntransaction price based on the relative\nstandalone selling price.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n74\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired,\nincluding the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment analysis annually\nor more frequently if needed.\nSuch impairment analyses for goodwill requires a comparison of the\nfair value to the\ncarrying value of reporting units.\nWe regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: global dental; global\nmedical; and technology and value-added services.\nGoodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the\npurposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific identification\nbasis.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we tested goodwill\nfor impairment, on the first\nday of the fourth quarter, using a quantitative analysis comparing the carrying value of our reporting\nunits,\nincluding goodwill, to the estimated fair value of our reporting units using\na discounted cash flow methodology.\nIf\nthe fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill\nof the reporting unit is considered not\nimpaired.\nConversely, impairment loss would be equivalent to the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over\nits fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\nthe identification of reporting units,\nassignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services\nto the reporting units, and ultimately the\ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit is calculated by\napplying the discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with\na market approach.\nThere are inherent\nuncertainties related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgments\nin applying them to this analysis.\nThe most\nsignificant inputs include estimation of future cash flows based on budget\nexpectations, and determination of\ncomparable companies to develop a weighted average cost of capital for each\nreporting unit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a $\n20\nmillion impairment of goodwill relating to the disposal\nof an unprofitable business whose estimated fair value was lower than\nits carrying value.\nThe disposal of this\nbusiness is part of our restructuring initiative as more fully discussed\nin\n.\nFor the year ended December 25, 2021, the results of our goodwill\nimpairment analysis did\nno\nt\nresult in any impairments.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, are evaluated for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable\nthrough the estimated undiscounted future\ncash flows to be derived from such assets.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements,\ntrademarks, trade names, customer\nlists, customer relationships and product development.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses\nare only recorded if the asset’s\ncarrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted\nfuture cash flows.\nWe measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the\nestimated fair value.\nWhen an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021\nand December 26, 2020, we recorded total\nimpairment charges on intangible assets of $\n34\nmillion, $\n1\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion, respectively, as more fully\ndiscussed in\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events\nthat have been recognized in our\nfinancial statements or tax returns.\nIn estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected\nfuture\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n75\nevents other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.\nThe effect on deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in\nthe period that includes the enactment date.\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our 80% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries\n.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nSome minority stockholders in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have\nthe right, at certain times, to require us\nto acquire their ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\nTheir interests in these subsidiaries are classified\noutside permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are\ncarried at the estimated redemption amounts.\nThe redemption amounts have been estimated based on expected future\nearnings and cash flow and, if such\nearnings and cash flow are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests might be impacted.\nChanges in the estimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling\ninterests subject to put options are reflected at\neach reporting period with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in\ncapital.\nFuture reductions in the\ncarrying amounts are subject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the\nfair value of the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests at the time they were originally recorded.\nThe recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests\ncannot go below the floor level.\nAdjustments to the carrying amount of noncontrolling interests\nto\nreflect a fair value redemption feature do not impact the calculation of earnings\nper share.\nOur net income is\nreduced by the portion of the subsidiaries’ net income that is attributable\nto redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNon-controlling interest represents the ownership interests of certain\nminority owners of our consolidated\nsubsidiaries.\nOur net income is reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries\nnet income that is attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the\nUnited States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded\ndirectly as an adjustment to\nstockholders’ equity.\nOur comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income,\nforeign currency\ntranslation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency\nhedging activities and pension adjustment gain.\nRisk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur\nobjective is to manage the impact that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\ncould have on recognized asset\nand liability fair values, earnings and cash flows, as well as our net\ninvestments in foreign subsidiaries.\nOur risk\nmanagement policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be\neffective at reducing the risks associated\nwith the exposure being hedged and be designated as a hedge at the inception\nof the contract.\nWe do not enter into\nderivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nOur derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency\nforward agreements related to certain intercompany loans, certain forecasted\ninventory purchase commitments with\nforeign suppliers and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of\nour euro-denominated foreign\noperations which are designated as net investment hedges.\nForeign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory\npurchase commitments with foreign suppliers\nand foreign currency swaps related to foreign currency denominated debt are designated\nas cash flow hedges.\nFor\nderivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the changes\nin the fair value of the derivative is\nrecorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income\nin stockholders’ equity and subsequently\nreclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction\naffects earnings.\nWe classify the\ncash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows as the\ncash flows related to the hedged item.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n76\nForeign currency forward contracts related to our euro-denominated\nforeign operations are designated as

translation\ngain (loss) component of Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the net investment\nis sold or substantially liquidated.\nOur foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency\nbalance sheet exposure provide economic\nhedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\nFor agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative,\nalong with the transaction gain or\nloss on the hedged item, are recorded in other, net, within our consolidated statements of income.\nTotal return swaps are entered into for the purpose of economically hedging our unfunded non-qualified\nsupplemental retirement plan (“SERP”) and our deferred compensation plan\n(“DCP”).\nThis swap will offset\nchanges in our SERP and DCP liabilities.\nThis swap is expected to be renewed on an annual basis and is\nrecorded\nin selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated\nstatements of income.\nForeign Currency Translation\nand Transactions\nThe financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries\nare determined using local currency as\nthe functional currency.\nAssets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange\nrate in effect at\neach year-end.\nIncome statement accounts are translated at the average rate\nof exchange prevailing during the year.\nTranslation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included\nin\nAccumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in earnings.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\nOn December 26, 2021 we adopted Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) No. 2021 – 08, “Accounting for\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”\n(Subtopic 805).\nASU 2021 – 08 requires\nan acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired\nin a business combination in\naccordance with ASU No. 2014 - 09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”\n(Topic 606).\nAt the acquisition\ndate, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance\nwith Topic 606 as if it had\noriginated the contracts.\nTo achieve this, an acquirer may assess how the acquiree applied Topic 606 to determine\nwhat to record for the acquired revenue contracts.\nGenerally, this should result in an acquirer recognizing and\nmeasuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how\nthey were recognized and\nmeasured in the acquiree’s financial statements.\nOur adoption of ASU 2021 - 08 did not have a material impact on\nour consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 27, 2020 we adopted ASU No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes” (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting\nfor Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”).\nASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by\nremoving

acquisition method of accounting, where the net\nassets of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition\ndate and our consolidated financial\nstatements include their results of operations from that date.\nAny excess of acquisition consideration over the fair\nvalue of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future\neconomic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination\nthat are not individually identified\nand separately recognized, such as future customers and technology, as well as the assembled workforce.\nExcluding goodwill, the major classes of assets and liabilities to which\nwe generally allocate acquisition\nconsideration include identifiable intangible assets (i.e., customer\nrelationships and lists, trademarks and trade\nnames, product development, and non-compete agreements), inventory\nand accounts receivable.\nThe estimated fair\nvalue of identifiable intangible assets is based on critical judgments and\nassumptions derived from analysis of\nmarket conditions, including discount rates, projected revenue growth rates\n(which are based on historical trends\nand assessment of financial projections), estimated customer attrition and projected\ncash flows.\nThese assumptions\nare forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nSome prior owners of acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional\npurchase price cash consideration, or\nwe may be entitled to recoup a portion of purchase price cash consideration\nif certain financial targets are met.\nWe\nhave accrued liabilities for the estimated fair value of additional purchase\nprice consideration at the time of the\nacquisition, using the income approach, including a probability-weighted\ndiscounted cash flow method or an option\npricing method, where applicable.\nAny adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded\nin selling, general and\nadministrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\nacquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable,\nour estimates are inherently uncertain and\nsubject to refinement.\nAs a result, within 12 months following the date of acquisition,\nor the measurement period,\nwe may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill\nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAt the end of the measurement period or final determination\nof the values\nof such assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first,\nany subsequent adjustments are recognized in\nour consolidated statements of operations.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n82\n2022 Acquisitions\nWe completed

STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n90\nNote 9 – Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value hierarchy distinguishes between\n(1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained\nfrom independent sources (observable\ninputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best\ninformation available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority\nto unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:\n•\nLevel 1— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\nor liabilities that are accessible at the\nmeasurement date.\n•\nLevel 2— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable\nfor the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities\nin active markets;\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are\nnot active; inputs other than quoted\nprices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are\nderived principally from or corroborated by\nobservable market data by correlation or other means.\n•\nLevel 3— Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nThe following section describes the fair values of our financial instruments\nand the methodologies that we used to\nmeasure their fair values.\nInvestments and notes receivable\nThere are no quoted market prices available for investments in unconsolidated\naffiliates and notes receivable.\nCertain of our notes receivable contain variable interest rates.\nWe believe the carrying amounts are a reasonable\nestimate of fair value based on the interest rates in the applicable markets.\nDebt\nThe fair value of our debt (including bank credit lines, current maturities\nof long-term debt and long-term debt) is\nclassified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, and as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was\nestimated at $\n1,149\nmillion and $\n873\nmillion, respectively.\nFactors that we considered when estimating the fair\nvalue of our debt include market conditions, such as interest rates and credit\nspreads.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and\nsignificant other observable inputs.\nWe use\nderivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nOur derivative\ninstruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements related\nto certain intercompany loans, certain\nforecasted inventory purchase commitments with foreign suppliers,\nforeign currency forward contracts to hedge a\nportion of our euro-denominated foreign operations which are designated\nas net investment hedges and a total\nreturn swap for the purpose of economically hedging our unfunded\nnon-qualified SERP and our DCP.\nThe fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts\nare obtained by comparing our contract\nrate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which\nis based on market rates for comparable\ntransactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nSee\nfor further information.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n91\nTotal\nReturn Swaps\nThe fair value for the Total Return Swap is measured by valuing the underlying ETFs of the swap using market-on-\nclose pricing by industry providers as of the valuation date and are\nclassified within Level 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\nThe values for Redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified within\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are\nbased on recent transactions and/or implied multiples of earnings.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nAssets measured on a non-recurring basis at fair value include Goodwill\nand Other intangibles, net, and are\nclassified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.\nSee\nand\nfor additional information.\nThe following table presents\nour assets and

INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n92\nNote 10 – Concentrations of Risk\nCertain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of\ncredit risk.\nThese financial instruments\nconsist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term investments,\nnotes receivable and derivative\ninstruments.\nIn all cases, our maximum exposure to loss from credit\nrisk equals the gross fair value of the financial\ninstruments.\nWe routinely maintain cash balances at financial institutions in excess of insured amounts.\nWe have\nnot experienced any loss in such accounts and we manage this risk through\nmaintaining cash deposits and other\nhighly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions.\nWe continuously assess the need for reserves for\nsuch losses, which have been within our expectations.\nWe do not require collateral or other security to support\nfinancial instruments subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable.\nWe limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative\ninstruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions\nwho are the counter-parties to such\nfinancial instruments.\nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and\nutilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties.\nWith respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively large customer base\nand\nits dispersion across different types of health care professionals and geographic areas.\nNo single customer\naccounted for more than\n2\n% of our net sales in 2022 or 2021.\nWith respect to our sources of supply, our top 10\nhealth care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately\n28\n% and\n4\n%,\nrespectively, of our aggregate purchases in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.\nOur long-term notes receivable primarily represent strategic financing arrangements\nwith certain affiliates.\nGenerally, these notes are secured by certain assets of the counterparty; however, in most cases our security is\nsubordinate to other commercial financial institutions.\nWhile we have exposure to credit loss in the event of non-\nperformance by these counter-parties, we conduct ongoing assessments\nof their financial and operational\nperformance.\nNote 11 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S.\ndollar and each other, and changes to the credit risk of the derivative counterparties.\nWe attempt to minimize these\nrisks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by\nmaintaining counter-party credit limits.\nThese\nhedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange\nand credit risks.\nFactors that could\ninfluence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and\navailability of hedging\ninstruments and liquidity of the credit markets.\nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are\ncomponents of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose\nof hedging an existing or anticipated\ncurrency exposure.\nWe do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by\ndiversifying our counterparties, maintaining a strong balance sheet and\nhaving multiple sources of capital.\nDuring 2019 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge\na portion of our euro-denominated\nforeign operations which are designated as net investment hedges.\nThese net investment hedges offset the change\nin the U.S. dollar value of our investment in certain euro-functional currency\nsubsidiaries due to fluctuating foreign\nexchange rates.\nGains and losses related to these net investment hedges are recorded\nin accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss within our consolidated balance sheets.\nAmounts excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are included in interest expense within our consolidated statements\nof income.\nThe aggregate\nnotional value of this net investment hedge, which matures on\nNovember 16, 2023\n, is approximately €\n200\nmillion.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we\nrecorded losses of $\n9\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion, respectively, within other comprehensive income related to these foreign currency forward contracts.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n93\nOn\nMarch 20, 2020\n, we entered into a total return swap for the purpose of economically hedging\nour unfunded non-\nqualified SERP and our DCP.\nThis swap will offset changes in our SERP and DCP liabilities.\nAt the inception, the\nnotional value of the investments in these plans was $\n43\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2022, the notional value of the\ninvestments in these plans was $\n78\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2022, the financing blended rate for\nthis swap was\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) of\n4.03\n% plus\n0.55\n%, for a combined rate of\n4.58\n%.\nFor\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, we have\nrecorded a gain/(loss), within selling, general\nand administrative in our consolidated statement of income, of approximately\n($\n17\n) million and $\n12\nmillion,\nrespectively, net of transaction costs, related to this undesignated swap.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022\nand December 25, 2021, the swap resulted in a neutral impact to our\nresults of operations.\nThis swap is expected to\nbe renewed on an annual basis after its current expiration date of March 31, 2023,\nand is expected to result in a\nneutral impact to our results of operations.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nFluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared\nto the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively\naffect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed\nin U.S.\ndollars.\nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily\nforeign currency forward\ncontracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations on earnings.\nWe purchase\nshort-term (i.e., generally 18 months or less) foreign currency forward contracts\nto protect against currency\nexchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international\nsubsidiaries and the payment of\nmerchandise purchases to our foreign suppliers.\nWe do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into\nU.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an economic\nexposure.\nAmounts related to our\nhedging activities are recorded in prepaid expenses and other and/or accrued\nexpenses: other within our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nOur hedging activities have historically not had a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nAccordingly, additional disclosures related to derivatives and hedging activities required by\nASC 815 have been omitted.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO

maximum leverage ratios.\nAdditionally, the Credit Agreement contains customary\nrepresentations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative\ncovenants, subject to\nnegotiated

tax rate primarily\nrelates to\nstate and foreign income taxes and interest expense.\nIn 2021, the difference between our effective tax rate and the\nfederal statutory tax rate was primarily due to state and foreign income\ntaxes and interest expense.\nIn 2020, our\neffective tax rate was\n19.1\n%.\nThe difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate was\nprimarily due to an Advance Pricing Agreement with the U.S Internal Revenue\nService (the “IRS”) in the U.S.,\nother audit resolutions, state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (H.R. 5376) (“IRA”) was\nsigned into law in the United States.\nAmong other things, the IRA imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum\ntax for tax years beginning

Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES\nAct”) was enacted in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe CARES Act includes, but is not limited to, certain income tax\nprovisions that modify the Section 163(j) limitation of business interest and\nnet operating loss carryover and\ncarryback rules.\nThe modifications to Section 163(j) increase the allowable business\ninterest

(the “Tax\nAct”).\nThe final regulations concern the global intangible low-taxed income\n(“GILTI”) and subpart F income\nprovisions of the Tax Act.\nTo provide flexibility to taxpayers, the IRS is permitting the application of these final\nregulations to prior tax years, if the taxpayer elects to do so.\nWe have analyzed the final regulations, which do not\nhave a material impact to our

passed the Tax Act, which requires U.S. companies to pay a\nmandatory one-time transition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been\nrepatriated to the U.S.\nThe\ntransition tax is payable over eight years.\nWithin our consolidated balance sheets, transition tax of $\n19\nmillion and\n$\n14\nmillion were included in “accrued taxes” for 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $\n23\nmillion and $\n42\nmillion\nwere included in “other liabilities” for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDue to the one-time transition tax and the imposition of the GILTI provisions, all previously unremitted earnings\nwill no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, there could be U.S., state and/or foreign withholding\ntaxes upon distribution of such unremitted earnings.\nDetermination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax\nliability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.\nASC 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized\nin the financial statements in\naccordance with other provisions contained within this guidance.\nThis topic prescribes a recognition threshold and\na measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement\nof tax positions taken or expected\nto be taken in a tax return.\nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely\nthan not to be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nThe amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of\nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate\naudit settlement.\nIn the normal course of\nbusiness, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing\nauthorities.\nSuch examinations may result in\nfuture tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain\ntax positions taken in respect of certain\ntax matters.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in “other\nliabilities” within our consolidated\nbalance sheets, as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was approximately\n$\n94\nmillion and $\n84\nmillion,\nrespectively, of which $\n80\nmillion and $\n69\nmillion, respectively would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.\nIt\nis possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in\nthe next 12 months, which may result in a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated statements of income.\nAll tax returns audited by the IRS are officially closed through 2018.\nThe tax years subject to examination by the\nIRS include years 2019 and forward.\nIn addition, limited positions reported in the 2017 tax year are subject\nto IRS\nexamination.\nDuring the quarter ended December 25, 2021, we were notified by\nthe IRS that tax year 2019 was\nselected for examination.\nDuring the quarter ended June 26, 2021 we reached a resolution with\nthe Appellate\nDivision for all remaining outstanding issues for 2012 and 2013.\nDuring the quarter ended September 26, 2020 we reached an agreement with\nthe Advanced Pricing Division on an\nappropriate transfer pricing methodology for the years 2014-2025.\nThe objective of this resolution was to mitigate\nfuture transfer pricing audit adjustments.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we reached a resolution with the IRS for the\n2014-2016 audit cycle.\nThe total amounts of interest and penalties are classified as a component of\nthe provision for income taxes.\nThe\namount of tax interest expense (credit) was approximately $\n0\nmillion, $\n0\nmillion and $(\n3\n) million in 2022, 2021\nand

other\nlong-lived assets and lease exit costs.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, in connection with our\nrestructuring plan, we vacated\none\nof\nthe buildings at our corporate headquarters in Melville NY, which resulted in an accelerated amortization of right-\nof-use lease asset of $\n34\nmillion.\nWe also initiated the disposal of a non-profitable US business and recorded\nrelated costs of $\n49\nmillion which primarily consisted of impairment of intangible assets\nand goodwill, inventory\nimpairment, and severance and employee-related costs.\nThese expenses are included in the $\n128\nmillion of\nrestructuring charges discussed above.\nThe disposal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023.\nOn August 26, 2022, we acquired Midway Dental

those cases one or more of Henry Schein, Inc.’s subsidiaries is\nalso named as a defendant).\nGenerally, the lawsuits allege that the manufacturers of prescription opioid drugs\nengaged in a false advertising campaign to expand the market for such drugs and\ntheir own market share and that\nthe entities in the supply chain (including Henry Schein, Inc. and\nits affiliated companies) reaped financial rewards\nby refusing or otherwise failing to monitor appropriately and restrict\nthe improper distribution of those drugs.\nThese actions consist of some that have been consolidated within

certain employees under the terms of our\n2020 Stock Incentive Plan and to\nnon-employee directors under the terms of our 2015 Non-Employee Director\nStock Incentive Plan (together, the\n“Plans”).\nThe Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board\nof Directors (the\n“Compensation Committee”).\nHistorically, equity-based awards to our employees have been granted solely in the\nform of time-based and performance-based restricted stock units\n(“RSUs”).\nHowever, for our 2021 fiscal year, in\nlight of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Compensation Committee determined\nit would be difficult for management\nto set a meaningful three-year cumulative earnings per share target as the goal applicable\nto performance-based\nRSU awards as it had done in prior years.\nInstead, the Compensation Committee set our equity-based awards\nto\nemployees for fiscal 2021 in the form of time-based RSUs and non-qualified\nstock options which focus on stock\nvalue appreciation and retention instead of pre-established performance goals.\nOur non-employee directors\ncontinued to receive equity-based awards for fiscal 2021 solely in the form of time-based\nRSUs.\nIn March 2022,\nthe Compensation Committee reinstated performance-based RSUs\nfor equity-based awards to employees for fiscal\n2022 and awarded grants in the form of performance-based RSUs,\ntime-based RSUs and non-qualified stock\noptions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were\n70,942,657\nshares authorized and\n8,034,696\nshares available to be granted\nunder the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan and\n1,892,657\nshares authorized and\n192,400\nshares available to be granted\nunder the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan.\nRSUs are stock-based awards granted to recipients with specified vesting provisions.\nIn the case of RSUs, common\nstock is delivered on or following satisfaction of vesting conditions.\nWe issue RSUs to employees that primarily\nvest (i) solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time, primarily with\nfour\n-year cliff vesting and/or (ii)\nbased on achieving specified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time, primarily\nwith\nthree\n-year cliff vesting.\nRSUs granted under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive\nPlan primarily\nare granted with\n12\n-month cliff vesting.\nFor these RSUs, we recognize the cost as compensation expense on\na\nstraight-line basis.\nWith\nrespect to time-based RSUs, we estimate the fair value on the date\nof grant based on our closing stock price at\nthe time of grant.\nWith respect to performance-based RSUs, the number of shares that ultimately vest\nand are\nreceived by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured against\nspecified targets over a specified\nperiod, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nAlthough there is no guarantee that performance targets\nwill be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs based\non our closing stock price at time of\ngrant.\nEach of the Plans provide for certain adjustments to the performance\nmeasurement in connection with awards under\nthe Plans.\nWith respect to the performance-based RSUs granted under our 2020 Stock Incentive Plan, such\nperformance measurement adjustments relate to significant events, including,\nwithout limitation, acquisitions,\ndivestitures, new business ventures, certain capital transactions (including share\nrepurchases), differences in\nbudgeted average outstanding shares (other than those resulting from capital\ntransactions referred to above),\nrestructuring costs, if any, certain litigation settlements or payments, if any, changes in accounting principles or in\napplicable laws or regulations, changes in income tax rates in certain\nmarkets, foreign exchange fluctuations, the\nfinancial impact of certain products and unforeseen events or circumstances affecting us.\nOver the performance period, the number of shares of common stock that will\nultimately vest and be issued and the\nrelated compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based upon\nour estimation of achieving such\nperformance targets.\nThe ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients and the\nrelated compensation cost\nrecognized as an expense will be based on our actual performance metrics\nas defined under the Plans.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n106\nStock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our\ncommon stock at a fixed price following\nvesting of the stock options.\nStock options are granted at an exercise price equal to our closing stock\nprice on the\ndate of grant.\nStock options issued beginning in 2021 vest\none-third\nper year based on the recipient’s continued\nservice, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan,\nare fully vested\nthree years\nfrom the\ngrant date and have a contractual term of\nten years\nfrom the grant date, subject to earlier termination of the term\nupon certain events.\nCompensation expense for these stock options is recognized\nusing a graded vesting method.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\nIn addition to equity-based awards granted in fiscal 2021 under the long-term\nincentive program, the Compensation\nCommittee granted a Special Pandemic Recognition Award under the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan to recipients of\nperformance-based RSUs under the 2018 long-term incentive program.\nThe payout under the performance-based\nrestricted stock units granted under the fiscal 2018 long-term incentive program\n(the “2018 LTIP”) was negatively\nimpacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nGiven the significance of the impact of the pandemic on our\nthree\n-\nyear EPS goal under such equity awards and the contributions made by our employees\n(including those who\nreceived such awards), on March 3, 2021, the Compensation Committee granted\na Special Pandemic Recognition\nAward to recipients of performance-based restricted stock units under the 2018 LTIP who were employed by us on\nthe grant date of the Special Pandemic Recognition Award.\nThese time-based RSU awards vest\n50\n% on the first\nanniversary of the grant date and\n50\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date, based on the recipient’s\ncontinued service and subject to the terms and conditions of the 2020 Stock Incentive\nPlan, and are recorded as\ncompensation expense using a graded vesting method.\nThe combination of the\n20\n% payout based on actual\nperformance of the 2018 LTIP and the one-time Special Pandemic Recognition Award granted in 2021 will\ngenerate a cumulative payout of\n75\n% of each recipient’s original number of performance-based restricted stock\nunits awarded in 2018 if the recipient satisfies the\ntwo\n-year vesting schedule commencing on the grant date.\nOur accompanying consolidated statements of income reflect pre-tax share-based\ncompensation expense of $\n54\nmillion ($\n41\nmillion after-tax), $\n78\nmillion ($\n60\nmillion after-tax) and $\n9\nmillion ($\n7\nmillion after-tax) for the years\nended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December
