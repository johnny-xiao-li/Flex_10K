The facility is expected to be operational during the first quarter of 2024.\nNGL Pipeline Expansion\n•\nIn November 2022, we announced plans to construct a new NGL pipeline (the “Daytona NGL Pipeline”) as an addition to our common carrier Grand Prix system. The pipeline will transport NGLs from the Permian Basin and connect to the 30-inch diameter segment of Grand Prix in North Texas, where volumes will be transported to our fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Daytona NGL Pipeline is expected to be in service by the end of 2024.\n6\nCapital Investments, Acquisitions and Divestitures\nIn January 2022, we completed the purchase of all of Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners’ (“Stonepeak”) interests in our development company joint ventures (“DevCo JVs”) for $926.3 million (the “DevCo JV Repurchase”). Following the DevCo JV Repurchase, we owned a 75% interest in the Permian to Mont Belvieu segment of Grand Prix through Grand Prix Pipeline LLC (the “Grand Prix Joint Venture”) (prior to the Grand Prix Transaction, as defined below), a 100% interest in the Train 6 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas and a 25% equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (“GCX”) (prior to the GCX Sale, as defined below). The DevCo JV Repurchase resulted in an $857.9 million reduction of Noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn April 2022, we completed the bolt-on acquisition of Southcross Energy Operating LLC and its subsidiaries (“Southcross”) for a purchase price of $201.9 million (the “South Texas Acquisition”), subject to customary closing adjustments. We made a final net working capital adjustment payment of approximately $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We acquired a portfolio of complementary midstream infrastructure assets and associated contracts that have been integrated into our SouthTX Gathering and Processing operations, including the remaining interests in the two joint ventures in South Texas that we previously held as investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which were consolidated beginning in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn May 2022, we completed the sale of Targa GCX Pipeline LLC, which held a 25% equity interest in GCX, to a third party for $857.0 million (the “GCX Sale”). As a result of the GCX Sale, we recognized a gain of $435.9 million in Gain (loss) from sale of equity method investment in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn July 2022, we completed the acquisition of all of the interests in Lucid Energy Delaware, LLC (“Lucid”) for approximately $3.5 billion in cash (the “Delaware Basin Acquisition”), subject to customary closing adjustments. We received a final net working capital adjustment payment of approximately $11.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The assets acquired in the Delaware Basin Acquisition provide natural gas gathering, treating, and processing services in the Delaware Basin, through owning and operating approximately 1,050 miles of natural gas pipelines and approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”) of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity primarily in Eddy and Lea counties of New Mexico. The Delaware Basin Acquisition assets are integrated into our Permian Delaware operations.\nIn January 2023, we completed the acquisition of Blackstone Energy Partners’ 25% interest in Grand Prix Joint Venture (the “Grand Prix Transaction”) for approximately $1.05 billion in cash. Following the closing of the Grand Prix Transaction, we own 100% of Grand Prix, including the Daytona NGL Pipeline.\nFor further details on our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 4 - Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 7 - Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates to our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 in this Form 10-K.\nCommon Share Repurchases and Preferred Stock Redemption\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased 395,798 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $70.75 for a total net cost of $28.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 3,412,354 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $65.87 for a total net cost of $224.8 million. There was $143.8 million remaining under our $500 million common share repurchase program as of December 31, 2022.\nIn May 2022, we redeemed all of our issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) at a redemption price of $1,050.00 per share, plus $8.87 per share, which is the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends from April 1, 2022 up to, but not including, the redemption date of May 3, 2022.\nFollowing the redemption, we have no Series A Preferred outstanding and all rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred were terminated. See Note 11 - Preferred Stock to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n7\nFinancing Activities\nIn February 2022, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as the Administrative Agent and Swing Line Lender, and the other lenders party thereto (the “TRGP Revolver”). The TRGP Revolver provides for a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount up to $2.75 billion, with an option to increase such maximum aggregate principal amount by up to $500.0 million in the future, subject to the terms of the TRGP Revolver, including a swing line sub-facility of up to $100.0 million. The TRGP Revolver matures in February 2027. In connection with our entry into the TRGP Revolver, we terminated our previous TRGP senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Previous TRGP Revolver”) and the Partnership's senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Partnership Revolver”). In February 2022, TRGP and the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Inc., (“Fitch”) and in March 2022, the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”). As a result, in accordance with the TRGP Revolver, the collateral under the TRGP Revolver was released from the liens securing our obligations thereunder. As a result of the termination of the Previous TRGP Revolver and the Partnership Revolver, we recorded a loss of $0.8 million due to a write-off of debt issuance costs.\nIn March 2022, the Partnership redeemed all of the outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “5.375% Notes”) with available liquidity under the TRGP Revolver. As a result of the redemption of the 5.375% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $15.0 million, comprised of $12.6 million of premiums paid and a write-off of $2.4 million of debt issuance costs.\nIn April 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.200% Senior Notes due 2033 (the “4.200% Notes”) and (ii) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.950% Senior Notes due 2052 (the “4.950% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer (the “March Tender Offer”) and the subsequent redemption of the Partnership’s 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2026 (the “5.875% Notes”), with the remainder of the net proceeds used for repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the TRGP Revolver. As a result of the March Tender Offer and the subsequent redemption of the 5.875% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $33.8 million, comprised of $29.3 million of premiums paid and a write-off of $4.5 million of debt issuance costs.\nIn July 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.200% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “5.200% Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.250% Senior Notes due 2052 (the “6.250% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. We used the net proceeds from the issuance to fund a portion of the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nIn July 2022, we entered into the Term Loan Agreement with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. as the Administrative Agent and a lender, and other lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Facility”). The Term Loan Facility provides for a three-year, $1.5 billion unsecured term loan facility and matures in July 2025. We used the proceeds to fund a portion of the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nIn July 2022, we established an unsecured commercial paper note program (the “Commercial Paper Program”). Under the terms of the Commercial Paper Program, we may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities of less than one year. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with the maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $2.75 billion. We maintain a minimum available borrowing capacity under the TRGP Revolver equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as support. The Commercial Paper Program is guaranteed by each subsidiary that guarantees the TRGP Revolver.\nIn September 2022, we amended the Partnership’s accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Securitization Facility”) to, among other things, increase the facility size from $400.0 million to $800.0 million and extend the facility termination date to September 1, 2023.\nIn January 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $900.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% Senior Notes due 2033 (the “6.125% Notes”) and (ii) $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.500% Senior Notes due 2053 (the “6.500% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance to fund the Grand Prix Transaction and the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to reduce borrowings under the TRGP Revolver and the Commercial Paper Program.\nFor additional information about our recent debt-related transactions, see Note 8 - Debt Obligations to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n8\nOrganization Structure\nThe diagram below shows our corporate structure as of February 17, 2023:\n(1)\nCommon shares outstanding as of February 17, 2023.\nGrowth Drivers, Competitive Strengths and Strategies\nWhile we believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on our growth drivers, competitive strengths and strategies outlined below, our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties which may prevent us from executing our strategies. These risks include the adverse impact of changes in natural gas, NGL and condensate/crude oil prices, the supply of, or demand for, these commodities, and our inability to access sufficient additional supplies to replace natural declines in production. For a more complete description of the risks associated with an investment in us, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nComprehensive package of midstream services\nWe provide a comprehensive package of services to natural gas and crude oil producers. These services are essential to gather, process, treat, purchase and sell and transport wellhead gas to meet pipeline standards; extract, transport and fractionate NGLs for sale into petrochemical, industrial, commercial and export markets; and gather and/or purchase and sell crude oil. We believe that our ability to offer these integrated services provides us with an advantage in competing for new supplies because we can provide substantially all of the services that producers, marketers and others require for moving natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from wellhead to market on a cost-effective basis. Additionally, we believe that the significant investment we have made to construct and acquire assets in key strategic positions and the expertise we have in operating such assets make us well-positioned to remain a leading provider of integrated services in the midstream sector.\n9\nOur transportation assets further enhance our position to offer an integrated midstream service across the NGL and natural gas value chain by linking supply to key markets. Grand Prix connects many of our gathering and processing positions, including the Permian Basin, with our Downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas, the major U.S. NGL market hub. Additionally, our integrated Mont Belvieu and Galena Park Marine Terminal assets allow us to provide the raw product, fractionation, storage, interconnected terminaling, refrigeration and ship loading capabilities to support exports by third-party customers.\nStrategically located and leading infrastructure positions\nWe believe our assets are not easily replicated, are located in many attractive and active areas of exploration and production activity and are near key markets and logistics centers. Our gathering and processing infrastructure is located in attractive oil and gas producing basins and is well positioned within each of those basins. Activity in the shale resource plays underlying our gathering assets is driven by the economics of oil, condensate, gas and NGL production from the particular reservoirs in each play impacting the volumes of natural gas and crude oil available to us for gathering, processing and/or purchase and sale on our systems. Producers continue to focus drilling activity on their most attractive acreage, especially in the Permian Basin where we have a large, well-positioned and interconnected footprint, benefiting from rig activity in and around our systems.\nAs drilling in these areas continues, the supply of NGLs requiring transportation to market hubs and fractionation is expected to continue to grow. Continued demand for transportation, fractionation and export capacity is expected to lead to increased demand for other related fee-based services provided by our logistics and transportation assets as well as provide other growth opportunities. The connectivity of our gathering and processing and Downstream operations provided by Grand Prix further allows us to capture these growth opportunities. Additionally, we are one of the largest fractionators of NGLs along the Gulf Coast. Our fractionation assets are primarily located in key NGL market centers and are near and connected to key consumers of NGL products, including the petrochemical and industrial markets. Our logistics assets, including fractionation facilities, storage wells, our low ethane propane de-ethanizer, and our Galena Park Marine Terminal and related pipeline systems and interconnects, include connections to a number of mixed NGL (“mixed NGLs” or “Y-grade”) supply pipelines, storage, interconnection and takeaway pipelines and other transportation infrastructure. The location and interconnectivity of these assets are not easily replicated, and we have additional capability to expand their capacity.\nHigh quality and efficient assets\nOur gathering and processing systems and logistics and transportation assets consist of high-quality, well-maintained facilities, resulting in low-cost, efficient operations. Advanced technologies have been implemented for processing plants (primarily cryogenic units utilizing centralized control systems), measurement systems (essentially all electronic and electronically linked to a central data-base) and operations and maintenance management systems to manage work orders and implement preventative maintenance schedules (computerized maintenance management systems). These applications have allowed proactive management of our operations resulting in lower costs and minimal downtime. We have established a reputation in the midstream industry as a reliable and cost-effective supplier of services to our customers and have a track record of safe, efficient and reliable operation of our facilities. We will continue to pursue new contracts, cost efficiencies and operating improvements of our assets. In the past, such improvements have included new production and acreage commitments, reducing fuel gas and flare volumes and improving facility capacity and NGL recoveries. We will also continue to optimize existing plant assets to improve and maximize capacity and throughput.\nIn addition to routine annual maintenance expenses, our maintenance capital expenditures have averaged approximately $141 million per year over the last three years. We believe that our assets are well-maintained, and we are focused on continuing to operate both our existing and new assets in a prudent, safe and cost-effective manner.\nFinancial flexibility\nWe have historically maintained sufficient liquidity and have funded our growth investments with a mix of cash flow from operations, equity, debt, asset sales and joint ventures over time in order to manage our leverage ratio. Disciplined management of liquidity, leverage and commodity price volatility allow us to be flexible in our long-term growth strategy, as well as allocating our free cash flow after dividends in a manner that maintains a strong credit profile.\nExperienced and long-term focused management team\nOur current executive management team possesses breadth and depth of experience working in the midstream energy business. Certain members of our executive management team have managed our businesses prior to acquisition by Targa or joined shortly thereafter. Other officers and key employees have significant experience in the industry, including extensive experience in operating our current assets and developing, permitting and constructing new assets.\n10\nAttractive cash flow characteristics, with large diverse business mix with favorable contracts and increasing fee-based business\nWe believe that our strategy, combined with our high-quality asset portfolio, allows us to generate attractive cash flows. Geographic, business and customer diversity enhances our cash flow profile. We provide our services under predominantly fee-based contract terms to a diverse mix of customers across our areas of operation. Our Gathering and Processing segment contract mix has increasing components of fee-based margin driven by: (i) fees added to percent-of-proceeds contracts for natural gas treating and compression, (ii) new/amended contracts with a combination of percent-of-proceeds and fee-based components, including fee floors, and (iii) fee-based gas gathering and processing and crude oil gathering contracts. Contracts for the Coastal portion of our Gathering and Processing segment are primarily hybrid contracts (percent-of-liquids with a fee floor) or percent-of-liquids contracts (whereby we receive an agreed upon percentage of the actual proceeds of the NGLs).\nContracts in the Downstream Business are predominantly fee-based (based on volumes and contracted rates), with a large take-or-pay component. Our contract mix, along with our commodity hedging program, serves to mitigate the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow.\nWe have hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. We have intentionally tailored our hedges to approximate specific NGL products and to approximate our actual NGL and residue natural gas delivery points. Although the degree of hedging will vary, we intend to continue to manage some of our exposure to commodity prices by entering into hedge transactions. We also monitor and manage our inventory levels with a view to mitigate losses related to downward price exposure.\nOur Business Operations\nOur operations are reported in two segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, and (ii) Logistics and Transportation (also referred to as the Downstream Business).\nGathering and Processing Segment\nOur Gathering and Processing segment consists of gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and purchasing and selling natural gas and gathering, storing, terminaling and purchasing and selling crude oil. The gathering or purchase of natural gas consists of aggregating natural gas produced from various wells through varying diameter gathering lines to processing plants. Natural gas has a widely varying composition depending on the field, the formation and the reservoir from which it is produced. The processing of natural gas consists of the extraction of embedded NGLs and the removal of water vapor and other contaminants to form (i) a stream of marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas, and (ii) a stream of mixed NGLs. Once processed, the residue gas is transported to markets through residue gas pipelines. End-users of residue gas include large commercial and industrial customers, as well as natural gas and electric utilities serving individual consumers. We sell our residue gas either directly to such end-users or to marketers into intrastate or interstate pipelines, which are typically located in close proximity or with ready access to our facilities. The gathering or purchase of crude oil consists of aggregating crude oil production through our pipeline gathering systems, which deliver crude oil to a combination of other pipelines, rail and truck.\nWe continually seek new supplies of natural gas and crude oil, both to offset the natural decline in production from connected wells and to increase throughput volumes. We obtain additional natural gas and crude oil supply in our operating areas by contracting for production from new wells or by capturing existing production currently gathered by others. Competition for new natural gas and crude oil supplies is based primarily on location of assets, commercial terms including pre-existing contracts, service levels and access to markets. The commercial terms of natural gas gathering and processing arrangements and crude oil gathering are driven, in part, by capital costs, which are impacted by the proximity of systems to the supply source and by operating costs, which are impacted by operational efficiencies, facility design and economies of scale.\nThe Gathering and Processing segment’s assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota (including the Bakken and Three Forks plays) and in the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. The natural gas processed in this segment is supplied through our gathering systems which, in aggregate, consist of approximately 30,900 miles of natural gas pipelines and include 50 owned and operated processing plants.\n11\nThe Gathering and Processing segment’s operations consist of (i) Permian Midland and Permian Delaware (also referred to as “Permian”), (ii) SouthTX, North Texas, SouthOK, WestOK (also referred to as “Central”), (iii) Coastal and (iv) Badlands, each as described below:\nPermian Midland\nThe Permian Midland system consists of approximately 7,210 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and 17 processing plants with an aggregate processing capacity of 3,039 MMcf/d, all located within the Permian Basin in West Texas. Eleven of these plants and approximately 5,100 miles of gathering pipelines belong to a joint venture (“WestTX”), in which we have an approximate 72.8% ownership. Pioneer Natural Resources (“Pioneer”), a major producer in the Permian Basin, owns the remaining interest in the WestTX\nsystem.\nIn response to increasing production and to meet the infrastructure needs of producers:\n•\nwe are constructing the Legacy II plant, a new 275 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas plant. The Legacy II plant is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2023.\n•\nwe are constructing the Greenwood plant, a new 275 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas plant. The Greenwood plant is expected to begin operations late in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nPermian Delaware\nThe Permian Delaware system consists of approximately 7,200 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and 15 processing plants with an aggregate capacity of 2,670 MMcf/d, all within the Delaware Basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico.\nAs part of the Delaware Basin Acquisition in July 2022, we acquired approximately 1,050 miles of natural gas pipelines and 1.4 Bcf/d of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity primarily in Eddy and Lea counties of New Mexico including the Red Hills VI plant, which was under construction at the time of acquisition. The Red Hills VI plant commenced operations at the end of the third quarter of 2022.\nIn response to increasing production and to meet the infrastructure needs of producers:\n•\nwe are constructing the Midway plant, a new 275 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant. The Midway plant is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2023. In conjunction with the commencement of operations of the Midway plant, we expect to idle the Sand Hills plant.\n•\nwe are constructing the Wildcat II plant, a new 275 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant. The Wildcat II plant is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024.\n•\nwe are transferring an existing cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which was acquired in the South Texas Acquisition (the “Roadrunner II plant”), to the Permian Delaware. The plant will be installed as a new 230 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, and is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2024.\nSouthTX\nThe South Texas system contains approximately 2,100 miles of high-pressure and low-pressure gathering and transmission pipelines and three natural gas processing plants in the Eagle Ford Shale with an aggregate processing capacity of 660 MMcf/d. The South Texas system processes natural gas through the Silver Oak I, Silver Oak II and Raptor gas processing plants.\nPrior to closing the South Texas Acquisition, we participated in and served as operator for two joint ventures in South Texas with a subsidiary of Southcross Energy Partners LLC, which consisted of our 75% share in T2 LaSalle Gathering Company LLC (“T2 LaSalle”) and our 50% share in T2 Eagle Ford Gathering Company LLC (“T2 Eagle Ford”), together (the “T2 Joint Ventures”). Following the closing of the South Texas Acquisition, we own 100% of the interest in the T2 Joint Ventures. T2 LaSalle owns approximately 70 miles of high-pressure gathering pipeline and T2 Eagle Ford owns approximately 120 miles of high-pressure gathering pipelines. Together, these two pipelines gather and transport gas to the Silver Oak plants. T2 Eagle Ford also owns the residue gas delivery pipelines downstream of the Silver Oak plants.\nWe also participate in a third joint venture (the “Carnero Joint Venture”) in South Texas with Evolve Transition Infrastructure LP (“Evolve Transition Infrastructure”). We own a 50% interest and Evolve Transition Infrastructure owns the remaining 50% interest. The Carnero Joint Venture owns and Targa operates the Silver Oak II plant, the Raptor plant and approximately 50 miles of high-pressure\n12\ngathering pipeline located in La Salle, Dimmitt and Webb Counties, Texas which connects Mesquite Energy Inc.’s Catarina Ranch gathering system and Comanche Ranch acreage to the Raptor plant.\nNorth Texas\nNorth Texas includes the Chico gathering system in the Fort Worth Basin, which gathers gas from the Barnett Shale and Marble Falls plays for processing at the Chico plant with a processing capacity of 265 MMcf/d. The system consists of approximately 4,700 miles of pipelines gathering wellhead natural gas.\nSouthOK\nThe SouthOK gathering system is located in the Ardmore and Anadarko Basins and includes the Golden Trend, SCOOP, and Woodford Shale areas of southern Oklahoma. The gathering system consists of approximately 1,600 miles of pipelines in 12 counties.\nThe SouthOK system includes six separate processing plants with an aggregate processing capacity of 710 MMcf/d, including: the Coalgate, Stonewall, Hickory Hills and Tupelo facilities, which are owned by our Centrahoma Joint Venture, and our wholly-owned Velma and Velma V-60 plants. We have a 60% ownership interest in Centrahoma. The remaining 40% ownership interest in Centrahoma is held by MPLX, LP.\nWestOK\nThe WestOK gathering system is located in north central Oklahoma and southern Kansas’ Anadarko Basin and includes the Woodford shale and the STACK. The gathering system consists of approximately 6,600 miles of pipelines in 15 counties.\nThe WestOK system has an aggregate processing capacity of 400 MMcf/d with two separate cryogenic natural gas processing plants known as the Waynoka I and Waynoka II facilities.\nCoastal\nOur Coastal assets, located in and offshore Louisiana, gather and process natural gas produced from shallow-water central and western Gulf of Mexico natural gas wells and from deep shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico production via connections to third-party pipelines or through pipelines owned by us. The Coastal system has an aggregate processing capacity of 2,025 MMcf/d and 11 MBbl/d of integrated fractionation capacity, and consists of approximately 1,000 miles of onshore gathering system pipelines, and approximately 200 miles of offshore gathering system pipelines. The processing plants are comprised of three wholly-owned and operated plants, one partially owned and operated plant, and one partially owned, non-operated plant. Our Coastal plants have access to markets across the U.S. through the interstate natural gas pipelines to which they are interconnected. The industry continues to rationalize gas processing capacity along the western Louisiana Gulf Coast with most of the producer volumes going to more efficient plants, such as our Lowry and Gillis plants.\nBadlands\nOur Badlands operations are located in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays of the Williston Basin in North Dakota and include approximately 500 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines, 120 MBbl of operational crude oil storage capacity at the Johnsons Corner Terminal, 30 MBbl of operational crude oil storage capacity at the Alexander Terminal, 30 MBbl of operational crude oil storage at New Town and 25 MBbl of operational crude oil storage at Stanley. The Badlands assets also include approximately 300 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and the Little Missouri I-III natural gas processing plants, which have a processing capacity of 90 MMcf/d. Additionally, Targa operates the 200 MMcf/d Little Missouri 4 plant (“LM4 plant”), in which Targa Badlands and Hess Midstream Partners LP each own a 50% interest. Targa owns 55% of Targa Badlands through a joint venture with Blackstone Credit and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities (collectively, “Blackstone”). The joint venture is a consolidated subsidiary and its financial results and related statistics are presented on a gross basis. Targa Badlands pays a minimum quarterly distribution (“MQD”) to Blackstone and Targa, with Blackstone having a priority right to the MQDs. Additionally, Blackstone’s capital contributions have a liquidation preference upon a sale of Targa Badlands. Targa Badlands is a discrete entity and the assets and credit of Targa Badlands are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of Targa or its other subsidiaries.\nThe following table lists the Gathering and Processing segment’s processing plants and related volumes for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n13\n14\n(1)\nCryo – Cryogenic Processing; RA – Refrigerated Absorption Processing.\n(2)\nProcessing capacity represents all parties' ownership.\n(3)\nPlant natural gas inlet represents the volume of natural gas passing through the meter located at the inlet of the natural gas processing plant, except for Badlands which represents the total wellhead volume.\n(4)\nPlant natural gas inlet and NGL production volumes represent our ownership share of volumes for partially owned plants that we proportionately consolidate based on our ownership interest, including our 72.8% of our undivided interest in our WestTX joint venture, as well as 100% of ownership interests for our consolidated VESCO joint venture, Silver Oak II, Raptor, Coalgate, Stonewall, Tupelo, and Hickory Hills plants.\n(5)\nPer day plant natural gas inlet and NGL production statistics for plants listed above are based on the number of calendar days during 2022. Plants acquired in the Delaware Basin acquisition and reflected in Permian Delaware include reported volumes based on number of calendar days during 2022 from August 1 through December 31, 2022.\n(6)\nPlant natural gas inlet throughput volumes and NGL production volumes for WestTX are presented on a pro-rata net basis representing our undivided ownership interest in WestTX, which we proportionately consolidate in our financial statements. In December 2022, the Gateway plant achieved the payout event related to the non-consent election made by the joint owner in our WestTX Permian Basin assets. As a result, the Gateway plant is now 72.8% owned and proportionately consolidated by Targa. Prior to the payout event, the Gateway plant was 100% owned and consolidated by Targa.\n(7)\nPlant is available and operates subject to market conditions, including availability of natural gas.\n(8)\nAs a result of a non-consent election made by the joint owner in our WestTX Permian Basin assets, the Heim and Legacy plants are 100% owned and consolidated by Targa.\n(9)\nThe Monument plant has fractionation capacity of approximately 1.8 MBbl/d.\n(10)\nWe anticipate shutting down the Coalgate plant in 2023.\n(11)\nThe Gillis plant has fractionation capacity of approximately 11 MBbl/d.\n(12)\nLittle Missouri Trains I and II are refrigeration plants and Little Missouri Train III is a Cryo plant.\nLogistics and Transportation Segment\nOur Logistics and Transportation segment is also referred to as our Downstream Business. Our Downstream Business includes the activities and assets necessary to transport and convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services described below. The Logistics and Transportation segment includes Grand Prix and associated assets, which are generally connected to and supplied in part by our Gathering and Processing segment. These assets are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Our fractionation, pipeline transportation, storage and terminaling businesses include approximately 2,300 miles of company-owned pipelines to transport mixed NGLs and specification products.\nThe Logistics and Transportation segment also transports, distributes, purchases and sells and markets NGLs via terminals and transportation assets across the U.S. We own or market products at terminal facilities in a number of states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. The geographic diversity of our assets provides direct access to many NGL customers as well as markets via trucks, barges, ships, rail cars and open-access regulated NGL pipelines owned by third parties.\nTransportation Pipelines\nOur primary pipeline asset is Grand Prix, which connects our gathering and processing positions throughout the Permian Basin, North Texas, and Southern Oklahoma (as well as third-party positions) to our fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Grand Prix transports NGLs from the Permian Basin on a 24-inch diameter pipeline, which is expandable to 550 MBbl/d, and from North Texas and South and Central Oklahoma via a pipeline of varying capacity, which both connect to a 30-inch diameter segment into Mont Belvieu, which is expandable to 950 MBbl/d. As of December 31, 2022, we owned a 75% interest in the Permian to Mont Belvieu segment of Grand Prix through the Grand Prix Joint Venture. In January 2023, we announced and closed on the acquisition of the remaining 25% interest in the Grand Prix Joint Venture.\nWe are constructing the Daytona NGL Pipeline as an addition to Grand Prix. The pipeline will transport NGLs from the Permian Basin and connect to the 30-inch diameter segment of Grand Prix in North Texas, where volumes will be transported to our fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas. The Daytona NGL Pipeline is expected to be in service by the end of 2024.\nThrough our 50% ownership interest in Cayenne Pipeline, LLC (“Cayenne”), we operate the Cayenne pipeline, which transports mixed NGLs from VESCO in Venice, Louisiana, to an interconnection with a third-party NGL pipeline in Toca, Louisiana.\nFractionation\nAfter being extracted in the field, mixed NGLs are typically transported to a centralized facility for fractionation where the mixed NGLs are separated into discrete NGL products: ethane, ethane-propane mix, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline.\nWe believe that sufficient volumes of mixed NGLs will be available for fractionation in commercially viable quantities for the foreseeable future due to historical increases in NGL production from shale plays and other shale-technology-driven resource plays in areas of the U.S. that include Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and the Rockies and certain other basins accessed by pipelines to Mont\n15\nBelvieu, as well as from conventional production of NGLs in areas such as the Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, East Texas, South Louisiana and shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico.\nAlthough competition for NGL fractionation services is primarily based on the fractionation fee, the ability of an NGL fractionator to obtain mixed NGLs and distribute NGL products is also an important competitive factor. This ability is a function of the existence of storage infrastructure and supply and market connectivity necessary to conduct such operations. We believe that the location, scope and capability of our logistics assets, including our transportation and distribution systems, give us access to both substantial sources of mixed NGLs and a large number of end-use markets.\nAt our Mont Belvieu operated facility, we have eight fractionation trains, representing an aggregate capacity of 843.0 MBbl/d, including: (1) five fractionation trains with an aggregate capacity of 493.0 MBbl/d that are part of our 88%-owned Cedar Bayou Fractionators, (2) Train 6, a 110 MBbl/d fractionation train, which is wholly-owned by Targa, (3) Train 7, a 120 MBbl/d fractionation train, a joint venture between Targa and the Williams Companies, Inc., in which Targa owns an 80% equity interest, and (4) Train 8, a 120 MBbl/d fractionation train, which is wholly-owned by Targa. Certain fractionation-related infrastructure for Train 7, such as storage caverns and brine handling, were funded and are owned 100% by Targa. Our fractionation trains are fully integrated with our existing Gulf Coast NGL storage, terminaling and delivery infrastructure, which includes an extensive network of connections to key petrochemical and industrial customers as well as our LPG export terminal at Galena Park on the Houston Ship Channel.\nWe are also constructing Train 9 at our Mont Belvieu operated facility, which is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2024.\nWe additionally have a wholly-owned and operated fractionation facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana, representing a capacity of 55.0 MBbl/d.\nIn addition to our operated facilities, we hold an equity investment in GCF, also located at Mont Belvieu. In January 2021, the GCF facility was temporarily idled, but is available for reactivation, subject to prevailing market conditions and agreement with our partners. We assumed operatorship of GCF in the first half of 2021. In January 2023, we reached an agreement with our partners to reactivate GCF. The facility is expected to be operational during the first quarter of 2024.\nWe also own fractionation assets in Monument, New Mexico, and Gillis, Louisiana, which are included in our Gathering and Processing segment. In addition, we have a natural gasoline hydrotreater at Mont Belvieu, Texas, with a capacity of 35.0 MBbl/d that removes sulfur from natural gasoline, allowing customers to meet stringent fuel content standards.\nThe following table details the Logistics and Transportation segment’s fractionation and treating facilities:\n(1)\nActual fractionation capacities may vary due to the composition of the NGLs being processed and does not contemplate ethane rejection.\n(2)\nCapacity represents 100% of the volume, and includes 40 MBbl/d of additional back-end butane/gasoline fractionation capacity.\n(3)\nLake Charles Fractionator runs in a mode of ethane/propane splitting for the local petrochemical market and is configured to also handle raw product.\n(4)\nGCF was temporarily idled in January 2021.\nNGL Storage and Terminaling\nIn general, our NGL storage assets provide warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in underground wells, which allows for the injection and withdrawal of such products at various times in order to meet supply and demand cycles. Similarly, our terminaling operations provide the inbound/outbound logistics and warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in above-ground storage tanks. Our NGL underground storage and terminaling facilities serve single markets, such as propane, as well as multiple products and markets. For example, the Mont Belvieu and Galena Park facilities have extensive pipeline connections for mixed NGL supply and delivery of component NGLs, including Grand Prix. In addition, some of our facilities are connected to marine, rail and truck loading and unloading facilities that provide services and products to our customers. We provide long and short-term storage and terminaling services and throughput capability to third-party customers for a fee.\n16\nAcross the Logistics and Transportation segment, we own 34 storage wells at our facilities with a gross NGL storage capacity of approximately 76 MMBbl and operate seven non-owned wells. The usage of these wells may be limited by brine handling capacity, which is utilized to displace NGLs from storage.\nWe operate our storage and terminaling facilities to support our key fractionation facilities at Mont Belvieu and Lake Charles for receipt of mixed NGLs and storage of fractionated NGLs to service the petrochemical, refinery, export and heating customers/markets as well as our wholesale domestic terminals that focus on logistics to service the heating market customer base. Our international export assets include our facilities at both Mont Belvieu and the Galena Park Marine Terminal near Houston, Texas, which have the capability to load propane, butanes and international grade low ethane propane. The facilities have an effective export capacity of up to 15 MMBbl per month, but given the mix of propane and butane demand, vessel size and availability of supply, and a variety of other factors, our effective working capacity is estimated to be approximately 12.5 MMBbl per month. We have the capability to load VLGC vessels, alongside small and medium sized export vessels. We continue to experience demand growth for U.S.-based NGLs (both propane and butane) for export into international markets and are in the process of enhancing our loading capabilities.\nThe following table details the Logistics and Transportation segment’s NGL storage and terminaling facilities:\n(1)\nVolumes reflect total import and export across the dock/terminal and may include volumes that have also been handled at the Mont Belvieu Terminal.\n(2)\nExcludes seven non-owned wells which we operate on behalf of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP. One additional well has been drilled and is being prepared for operations. One additional well is permitted.\n(3)\nFive of 12 owned wells leased to Citgo Petroleum Corporation under a long-term lease.\nNGL Distribution and Marketing\nWe market our own NGL production and also purchase component NGL products from other NGL producers and marketers for resale. We also purchase product for resale in our Logistics and Transportation segment.\nWe generally purchase mixed NGLs at a monthly pricing index less applicable fractionation, transportation and marketing fees and resell these component products to petrochemical manufacturers, refiners and other marketing and retail companies. This is primarily a physical settlement business in which we earn margins from purchasing and selling NGL products from customers under contract. We also earn margins by purchasing and reselling NGL products in the spot and forward physical markets.\nWholesale Domestic Marketing\nOur wholesale domestic propane marketing operations primarily sell propane and related logistics services to major multi-state retailers, independent retailers and other end-users. Our propane supply primarily originates from both our refinery/gas supply contracts and our other owned or managed Logistics and Transportation assets. We sell propane at a fixed posted price or at a market index basis at the time of delivery and in some circumstances, we earn margins on a netback basis.\nThe wholesale domestic propane marketing business is significantly impacted by seasonal and weather-driven demand, particularly in the winter, which can impact the price and volume of propane sold in the markets we serve.\nRefinery Services\nIn our refinery services business, we typically provide NGL balancing services through contractual arrangements with refiners in several locations to purchase and/or market propane and to supply butanes. We use our commercial transportation assets (discussed below) and contract for and use the storage, transportation and distribution assets included in our Logistics and Transportation segment to assist refinery customers in managing their NGL product demand and production schedules. This includes both feedstocks consumed in refinery processes and the excess NGLs produced by other refining processes. Under typical netback purchase contracts, we generally retain a portion of the resale price of NGL sales or receive a fixed minimum fee per gallon on products sold. Under netback sales contracts, fees are earned for locating and supplying NGL feedstocks to the refineries based on a percentage of the cost to obtain such supply or a minimum fee per gallon.\n17\nKey factors impacting the results of our refinery services business include production volumes, prices of propane and butanes, as well as our ability to perform receipt, delivery and transportation services in order to meet refinery demand.\nCommercial Transportation\nOur NGL transportation and distribution infrastructure includes a wide range of assets supporting both third-party customers and the delivery requirements of our marketing and asset management business. We provide fee-based transportation services to refineries and petrochemical companies throughout the Gulf Coast area. Our assets are also deployed to serve our wholesale domestic distribution terminals, fractionation facilities, underground storage facilities and pipeline injection terminals. These distribution assets provide a variety of ways to transport products to and from our customers.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we lease and manage 606 railcars and 122 tractors, and own six vacuum trucks and two pressurized NGL barges.\nThe following table details the Logistics and Transportation segment’s raw NGL, propane and butane terminaling facilities:\n(1)\nThroughputs include volumes related to exchange agreements and third-party storage agreements.\n(2)\nThroughput volume reflects 100% of the facility capacity.\n(3)\nRail-to-truck transload equipment.\nNatural Gas Marketing\nWe also market natural gas available to us from the Gathering and Processing segment, purchase and resell natural gas in selected U.S. markets and manage the scheduling and logistics for these activities.\nSeasonality\nParts of our business are impacted by seasonality. Our Downstream marketing business can be significantly impacted by seasonal and weather-driven demand, which can impact the price and volume of product sold in the markets we serve, as well as the level of inventory we hold in order to meet anticipated demand. See further discussion of the extent to which our business is affected by seasonality in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nOperational Risks and Insurance\nWe are subject to all risks inherent in the midstream natural gas, NGLs and crude oil businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, explosions, fires, mechanical failure, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, product spillage, weather, nature and inadequate maintenance of rights of way. These risks could result in damage to or destruction of operating assets and other property, or could result in personal injury, loss of life or environmental pollution, as well as curtailment or suspension of operations at the affected facility. We maintain, on behalf of ourselves and our subsidiaries, including the Partnership, general public liability, property, boiler and machinery and business interruption insurance in amounts that we consider to be appropriate for such risks. Such insurance is subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions that we consider reasonable and not excessive given the current insurance market environment.\nThe occurrence of a significant loss that is not insured, fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations, could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. While we currently maintain levels and types of insurance that we believe to be prudent under current insurance industry market conditions, our inability to secure these levels and types of insurance in the future could negatively impact our business operations and financial stability, particularly if an uninsured loss were to occur. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain these levels of insurance in the future at\n18\nrates considered commercially reasonable, particularly named windstorm coverage and contingent business interruption coverage for our onshore operations, and potentially excess liability insurance given the current insurance market environment.\nCompetition\nWe face strong competition in acquiring new natural gas or crude oil supplies. Competition for natural gas and crude oil supplies is primarily based on the location and available capacity of gathering and processing facilities, pricing arrangements, reputation, efficiency, flexibility, treating capabilities (as applicable), reliability and access to end-use markets or liquid marketing hubs. Our gathering and processing operations competitors are other natural gas gatherers and processors, such as major interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, master limited partnerships and oil and gas producers.\nWe also compete for NGL supplies for Grand Prix. Competition for NGL supplies is primarily based on the proximity of gathering and processing facilities in relation to one or more NGL pipelines, their connectivity to NGL pipeline takeaway options, access to end-use markets or liquid marketing hubs, pricing and contractual arrangements, available capacity, reputation, efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. Our NGL pipeline competitors are other midstream providers with NGL transportation capabilities, such as major interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, master limited partnerships and midstream natural gas and NGL companies.\nAdditionally, we face competition for mixed NGLs supplies at our fractionation facilities. The fractionators in which we own an interest in the Mont Belvieu region compete for volumes of mixed NGLs with other fractionators also located at Mont Belvieu, Texas. In addition, certain producers fractionate mixed NGLs for their own account in captive facilities. The Mont Belvieu fractionators also compete on a more limited basis with fractionators in Conway, Kansas and a number of decentralized, smaller fractionation facilities in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Our other fractionation facilities compete for mixed NGLs with the fractionators at Mont Belvieu as well as other fractionation facilities located in Louisiana. Our customers who are significant producers of mixed NGLs and NGL products or consumers of NGL products may develop their own fractionation facilities in lieu of using our services.\nWe also compete for NGL products to market through our Logistics and Transportation segment. Our competitors include major oil and gas producers who market NGL products for their own account and for others. Additionally, we compete with several other NGL marketing companies, trading organizations and petrochemical operators.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our employees are the foundation to fostering the safe operation of our assets and delivery of services to our customers. We foster a collaborative, inclusive, and safety-minded work environment, focused on working safely every day. We seek to identify qualified internal and external talent for our organization, enabling us to execute on our strategic objectives.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,850 people that primarily support our operations through a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be good.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nSafety is a core value of ours and begins with the protection and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where we operate. We value people above all else and remain committed to making safety and health our top priority. We believe that “Zero is Achievable”, and our goal is to operate and deliver our products without any injuries. We continually seek to maintain and deepen our safety culture by providing a safe working environment that encourages active employee engagement, including implementing safety programs to achieve improvements in our safety culture.\nTo protect our employees, contractors, and surrounding community from workplace hazards and risks, we implement and maintain an integrated system of policies, practices, and controls, including requirements to complete regular detailed safety and regulatory compliance training for all applicable individuals. For more information on the laws and regulations we are subject to with regard to employee, contractor, and community safety, please see our section below titled\nEnvironmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters.\nEmployee Experience\nWe are committed to fostering a work environment in which all employees treat each other with dignity and respect. This commitment extends to providing equal employment and advancement opportunities based on merit and experience. We believe this to be a fundamental principle and is defined in our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and our Code of Conduct. We continually strive to\n19\nattract a diverse workforce by advertising our external open jobs to several diversity job boards and partnering with local organizations to identify potential candidates to advance and strengthen our workforce.\nEmployee Talent Development and Retention\nAs a midstream infrastructure operator, we understand the importance of developing and fostering talent to ensure a skilled and talented diverse workforce both now and in the future. We value and provide opportunities for cross training and increased responsibilities, including leadership learning and formal coaching. These efforts allow us to recruit from within our organization for future vocational and occupational opportunities.\nOur management promotes formal and informal learning and development throughout the organization. Candid feedback is provided to employees through our annual performance review process as well as informal meetings throughout the year.\nWe offer developmental programs focused on building the skills of our employees and to help advance employee careers, knowledge, and skillsets through training and related programs.\nTo help plan and predict succession needs, we perform annual succession planning, which is discussed and reviewed with management and, for certain levels and positions, with the board of directors. We additionally monitor employee turnover rates and conduct exit interviews with employees who voluntarily leave the company to better understand their reasons for leaving the company.\nRegulation of Operations\nRegulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas, NGL and crude oil sales, and transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services.\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing Regulation\nOur natural gas gathering operations are typically subject to open access ratable take and/or common purchaser statutes and implementing rules and regulations in the states in which we operate, which generally require us to give pipeline access or to purchase, process, or take gas without undue discrimination. These statutes, rules, and regulations can restrict our ability as an owner of gathering and processing facilities to decide with whom (and on what terms) we contract to gather or process natural gas\nwith similarly situated customers (subject, in each case, to the limitations and requirements of each jurisdiction). In addition, the states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and, in certain cases, criminal penalties.\nSection 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation as a natural gas company by FERC under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas, such gatherers, in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas, are subject to Order No. 704. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.”\nSales of Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil\nThe price at which we buy and sell natural gas, NGLs and crude oil is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state rate regulation. However, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). See “—Regulation of Operations—EP Act of 2005.” We are required to report to FERC information regarding natural gas sale and purchase transactions for some of our operations, depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, in addition to civil penalties, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.\n20\nInterstate Natural Gas\nWe own (in conjunction with Pioneer) and operate the Driver Residue Pipeline, a gas transmission pipeline extending from our Driver processing plant in West Texas approximately ten miles to points of interconnection with intrastate and interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. We have obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC waiving certain of the Commission’s tariff and rate regulations. If, however, we receive a\nbona fide\nrequest for firm service on the Driver Residue Pipeline from a third party, FERC would reexamine the waivers it has granted us and would require us to file for authorization to offer “open access” transportation under its regulations, which would impose additional costs upon us.\nInterstate Liquids\nTarga NGL Pipeline Company LLC (“Targa NGL”), Targa Gulf Coast NGL Pipeline LLC (“Targa Gulf Coast”), and the Grand Prix Joint Venture have interstate NGL pipelines that are considered common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (the “ICA”). Targa Gulf Coast leases from Targa NGL certain pipelines that run between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Galena Park, Texas and between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Each of these pipelines is part of an extensive mixed NGL and purity NGL pipeline receipt and delivery system that provides services to domestic and foreign export customers.\nUnless covered by a waiver, as described below, the ICA requires that we maintain tariffs on file with FERC for interstate movements of liquids on our pipelines. Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. The ICA requires that tariff rates for liquids pipelines, which include both crude oil pipelines and refined products pipelines, be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory. Many FERC-regulated liquids pipelines, including our pipelines discussed below, use the FERC indexing methodology to change its rates. Pursuant to the FERC indexing methodology, FERC reviews the index formula every five years to determine whether a change in the methodology is required or, if not, to determine the appropriate index for the subsequent five-year period. On January 20, 2022, FERC issued an order on rehearing of its December 17, 2020 Order Establishing Index Level in which the Commission reduced the oil pricing index factor for oil pipelines to use for the current five-year period. As a result, the ceiling levels computed for July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, as well as the ceiling levels for the period July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, and the resulting rates currently in effect for certain of Targa’s liquids pipelines, were computed to account for the appropriate index factor. Some parties sought rehearing of the January 20 order with FERC, which was denied on May 6, 2022. Certain parties have appealed the January 20 and May 6 FERC orders, and the appeals remain pending before the DC Circuit.\nOn July 27, 2018, Targa NGL submitted a petition for declaratory order to FERC requesting approval of a proposed rate structure and terms of service for the portions of Grand Prix that Targa NGL operates from Oklahoma to Mont Belvieu, Texas. On March 11, 2019, the Commission granted Targa NGL’s petition for declaratory order (“March 19 Order”) subject to certain conditions, including that Targa NGL meet the requirements under the Commission’s regulations to establish an initial rate either by filing a sworn affidavit that the rate has been agreed to by at least one non-affiliate shipper or by providing a cost-of-service justification for the initial rate. Targa NGL requested rehearing on April 10, 2019, seeking Commission approval of Targa NGL’s contract rate with an affiliated shipper as a settlement rate as opposed to establishing an initial rate by the methods described in the March 2019 Order. On December 16, 2022, FERC denied Targa NGL’s rehearing request.\nTarga has multiple NGL pipelines that are also considered common carrier pipelines but have qualified for a waiver of applicable FERC regulatory requirements under the ICA based on current circumstances. Additionally, the crude oil pipeline system that is part of the Badlands assets operates under such a waiver, but this waiver is subject to a pending FERC proceeding as described below.\nAll such waivers are subject to revocation, however, should a particular pipeline’s circumstances change. FERC could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of these pipelines no longer qualify for a waiver. In the event that FERC were to determine that one more of these pipelines no longer qualified for waiver, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC for the applicable pipeline(s) and delivery point(s), provide a cost justification for the transportation charge, and provide regulated services to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. For example, on December 16, 2022, FERC initiated an investigation and established hearing procedures in FERC Docket No. OR23-2-000 to determine whether Targa’s Badland assets continue to qualify for the waiver of applicable FERC regulatory requirements and whether Targa is providing jurisdictional transportation service on this system.\nTribal Lands\nOur intrastate natural gas pipelines in North Dakota are subject to the various regulations of the State of North Dakota. In addition, various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), Office of Natural Resources Revenue (formerly the Minerals Management Service) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as the Three Affiliated Tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Please see “Other State and Local Regulation of Operations” below.\n21\nIntrastate Natural Gas\nThough our natural gas intrastate pipelines are not subject to regulation by FERC as natural gas companies under the NGA, our intrastate pipelines may be subject to certain FERC-imposed reporting requirements depending on the volume of natural gas purchased or sold in a given year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.”\nOur intrastate pipelines located in Texas are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “RRC”) and are required to have tariffs on file with the RRC. Some of these Texas intrastate pipelines also transport natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”). Under Sections 311 and 601 of the NGPA, an intrastate pipeline may transport natural gas in interstate commerce without becoming subject to FERC regulation as a “natural-gas company” under the NGA, but must file the terms and conditions of transportation of natural gas under authority of Section 311 with FERC, and these terms and conditions must be “fair and equitable.” Specifically, during 2022, TPL SouthTex Transmission Company LP. Targa Midland Gas Pipeline LLC, Midland-Permian Pipeline LLC, Targa SouthTex Mustang Transmission Ltd., and Targa SouthTex Transmission LP provided NGPA Section 311 service.\nOur Louisiana intrastate pipeline, Targa Louisiana Intrastate LLC, and the rates and terms of service on the pipeline are subject to regulation by the Office of Conservation of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (“DNR”).\nWe also operate natural gas pipelines that extend from the tailgate of our processing plants to interconnections with both intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. We believe these pipelines are exempt from FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act under FERC’s “stub” line exemption. Texas and Louisiana have adopted complaint-based regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to pipeline access and rate discrimination. The rates we charge for intrastate transportation are deemed just and reasonable unless challenged in a complaint. A complaint also can be filed with FERC regarding the rates, terms, and conditions of service on our pipelines providing service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state or FERC regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.\nIntrastate Liquids\nWe operate intrastate NGL pipelines in Texas that transport mixed and purity NGL streams between Targa’s Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas facilities. Grand Prix and Targa NGL provide transportation of mixed NGLs from points within Texas to other points within Texas, including Mont Belvieu, Texas. Further, we operate crude gathering pipelines in the Permian Basin. With respect to intrastate movements, these pipelines are not subject to FERC regulation, but are subject to rate regulation by the RRC.\nOur intrastate NGL pipelines in Louisiana gather mixed NGLs streams that we own from processing plants in Louisiana and deliver such streams to the Gillis and Lake Charles fractionators in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We deliver mixed and purity NGL streams out of our fractionator to and from Targa-owned storage, to other third-party facilities and pipelines in Louisiana. Additionally, through our 50% ownership interest in Cayenne, we operate the Cayenne pipeline, which transports mixed NGLs from the Venice gas plant in Venice, Louisiana, to an interconnection with a third-party NGL pipeline in Toca, Louisiana. These pipelines are not subject to FERC regulation or rate regulation by the DNR. On May 9, 2019, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (“LPSC”) approved applications to register certain pipelines of Cayenne and Targa Downstream LLC in accordance with the LPSC 2015 General Order, Docket No. R-33390. LPSC regulations require that common carrier pipelines charge rates that are just and reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory.\nEP Act of 2005\nThe EP Act of 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties up to a maximum amount that is adjusted annually for inflation, which for 2023 equals approximately $1.5 million per violation per day for violations of the NGA or NGPA. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce as well as entities that are otherwise subject to the NGA or NGPA. In 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005. Order No. 670 does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (Order No. 704), and the quarterly reporting requirement under Order No. 735.\n22\nFERC Market Transparency Rules\nUnder Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 Bcf of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.\nUnder Order No. 735, intrastate pipelines providing transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA and Hinshaw pipelines operating under Section 1(c) of the NGA are required to report on a quarterly basis more detailed transportation and storage transaction information, including: rates charged by the pipeline under each contract; receipt and delivery points and zones or segments covered by each contract; the quantity of natural gas the shipper is entitled to transport, store, or deliver; the duration of the contract; and whether there is an affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper. As currently written, this rule does not apply to our Hinshaw pipelines.\nAdditional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other midstream natural gas companies with whom we compete.\nOther State and Local Regulation of Operations\nOur business activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto, governing a wide variety of matters, including operations, marketing, production, pricing, community right-to-know, protection of the environment, safety, marine traffic and other matters. In addition, the Three Affiliated Tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, on which we operate a significant portion of our Badlands gathering and processing assets. The Three Affiliated Tribes is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. For additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal or local regulatory measures on our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”\nEnvironmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\nOur business operations are subject to numerous environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may be imposed at the federal, regional, state, tribal and local levels. The activities that we conduct in connection with (i) gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and purchasing and selling natural gas; (ii) storing, fractionating, treating, transporting, and purchasing and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; and (iii) gathering, storing, terminaling, and purchasing and selling crude oil are subject to or may become subject to stringent environmental regulation. We have implemented programs and policies designed to monitor and pursue operation of our pipelines, plants and other facilities in a manner consistent with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with these laws and regulations. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results.\nThe more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:\n•\nthe Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions;\n•\nthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;\n•\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;\n•\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;\n23\n•\nthe Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of onshore facilities, pipelines and other facilities, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, that are the site of an oil spill in waters of the United States, to liability for removal costs and damages;\n•\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;\n•\nthe Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas;\n•\nthe National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment; and\n•\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures.\nThese environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations generally restrict the level of substances generated as a result of our operations that may be emitted to ambient air, discharged to surface water, and disposed or released to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Additionally, there exist tribal, state and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal fines or penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Certain environmental laws also provide for citizen suits, which allow environmental organizations to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards continue to evolve.\nWe own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for crude oil and natural gas midstream services for many years. Additionally, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. Under environmental laws such as CERCLA and RCRA, we could incur strict joint and several liability for remediating hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators. We also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal or to which we sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at or from such third-party sites.\nOver time, the trend in environmental and occupational health and safety regulation is to typically place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment or expose workers to injury and thus, any changes in environmental or occupational health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that may arise in the future and result in more stringent or costly waste management or disposal, pollution control, remediation or occupational health and safety-related requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. We may not have insurance or be fully covered by insurance against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and we may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs arising out of such risks to our customers. We review regulatory and environmental issues as they pertain to us and we consider regulatory and environmental issues as part of our general risk management approach. For more information on environmental and occupational health and safety matters, see the following Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A. of this Form 10-K: “\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and a failure to comply or an accidental release into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities,” “We could incur significant costs in complying with stringent occupational safety and health requirements,” “Laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets,” “Our and our customers’ operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change (including  physical risks, or legislation or regulation to address climate change) that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide,” and “Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may impact our business.”\n24\nPipeline Safety Matters\nMany of our natural gas, NGL and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (“NGPSA”), with respect to natural gas, and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (“HLPSA”), with respect to crude oil, NGLs and condensates. The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate pipeline facilities. Pursuant to these acts, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain relatively higher risk areas, known as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) and moderate consequence areas (“MCAs”) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. Recently, PHMSA finalized adjustments to the repair criteria for pipelines in HCAs, created new criteria for pipelines in non-HCAs, and strengthened integrity management assessment requirements. Various states have also adopted regulations, similar to existing PHMSA regulations for, and may have established agencies analogous to PHMSA to regulate, intrastate gathering and transmission lines. We currently estimate an average annual cost of $4.1 million between 2023 and 2025 to implement pipeline integrity management program inspections along certain segments of our natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. This estimate does not include the costs, if any, of repair, remediation, or preventative and mitigative actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the discovery of conditions during the inspection program, which costs could be material. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with applicable pipeline integrity management regulations, as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of the pipeline integrity inspections. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Risk Factors “\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity programs and related repairs” and “Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation\n” under Item 1A. of this Form 10-K for further discussion on pipeline safety standards, including integrity management requirements.\nTitle to Properties and Rights of Way\nOur real property falls into two categories: (1) parcels that we own in fee and (2) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights of way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our plants and other major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which our plant sites and major facilities are located are held by us pursuant to ground leases or easements between us, as lessee or grantee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors or grantors. We and our predecessors have leased or held easements on these lands for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold or easement estates to such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, rights of way, permit, lease or license, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights of way, permits, leases and licenses.\nCorporation Tax Matters\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted. The CARES Act provided corporate taxpayers an expanded five-year net operating loss (“NOL”) carryback period for losses generated in tax years 2018 through 2020. Additionally, the CARES Act allowed corporate taxpayers to request an immediate refund of alternative minimum tax credits. We requested a cash refund from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of approximately $44 million related to the CARES Act provisions and received the refund in the second quarter of 2020. In November 2022, the IRS notified us that it completed the examination of Targa's NOL carryback and associated refund previously claimed under the CARES Act with no exceptions and had forwarded its report to the Joint Committee of Taxation. In January 2023, the Company was notified that the Joint Committee of Taxation had completed its review with no exceptions.\nOn October 6, 2021 and April 7, 2022, we received notice from the IRS that it intends to audit three direct and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Downstream LLC and Targa Midstream Services LLC) treated as partnerships for federal tax purposes for the 2019 and 2020 tax years. We are responding to the information requests from the IRS on these audits. Additionally, in January 2023, we received notice from the IRS that it intends to audit an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Targa Badlands Holdings LLC), which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the 2020 tax year. The Company is not aware of any potential audit findings that would give rise to adjustments to taxable income and does not anticipate material changes related to these audits.\n25\nAll federal statutes of limitations for returns filed in 2019 (for calendar year 2018) have expired. For Texas, the statute of limitations has expired for 2018 returns (for calendar year 2017). Similarly, the statute of limitations expired on substantially all 2018 state income tax returns that were filed prior to October 15, 2019. However, tax authorities have the ability to review and adjust carryover attributes (e.g., net operating losses) generated in a closed tax year if utilized in an open tax year.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA which, among other things, introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax (the “CAMT”), imposed a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, and provided tax incentives to promote clean energy. Under the CAMT, a 15% minimum tax will be imposed on certain financial statement income of “applicable corporations.” The IRA treats a corporation as an applicable corporation in any taxable year in which the “average annual adjusted financial statement income” of such corporation for the three taxable year period ending prior to such taxable year exceeds $1 billion.\nOn December 27, 2022, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued guidance on the application of the CAMT which may be relied upon until final regulations are released. Based on our interpretation of the IRA, the CAMT and related guidance, and a number of operational, economic, accounting and regulatory assumptions, we do not anticipate qualifying as an “applicable corporation” in the near term, but we are likely to become an applicable corporation in a subsequent tax year. If we become an applicable corporation and our CAMT liability is greater than our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for any particular tax year, the CAMT liability would effectively accelerate our future U.S. federal income tax obligations, reducing our cash available for distribution in that year, but provide an offsetting credit against our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for the future year. As a result, our current expectation is that the impact of the CAMT is limited to timing differences in future tax years. Given the complexities of the IRA and CAMT, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential future impact to our financial statements.\nFinancial Information by Reportable Segment\nSee “Segment Information” included under Note 24 of the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for a presentation of financial results by reportable segment and see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations– By Reportable Segment” for a discussion of our financial results by segment.\nAvailable Information\nWe make certain filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments and exhibits to those reports.

    "text": "The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks. You should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all the other information contained in this report. If any of the following risks were to occur, then our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSummary Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Results of Operations\n•\nOur cash flow is affected by supply and demand for natural gas, NGL products and crude oil and by natural gas, NGL, crude oil and condensate prices, and decreases in commodity prices and/or activity levels could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n•\nA reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refinery or other industries or by the fuel or export markets, or a significant increase in NGL product supply relative to this demand, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n•\nThe natural decline in production in our operating regions and in other regions from which we source NGL supplies means our long-term success depends on our ability to obtain new sources of supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, which depends on certain factors beyond our control. Any decrease in supplies of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n•\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n•\nWe operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our business.\n•\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our natural gas and crude oil gathering systems, terminals and processing facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, our revenues could be adversely affected.\n•\nWe typically do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas or crude oil reserves dedicated to our gathering pipeline systems; therefore, volumes on our systems in the future could be less than we anticipate.\n•\nWe do not own most of the land on which our pipelines, terminals and compression facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.\n•\nIf we lose any of our named executive officers, our business may be adversely affected.\n•\nClimatic events may damage our pipelines and other facilities, limit our ability or increase the costs to operate our business and adversely impact our customers on whom we rely on for throughput as well as third party vendors from whom we receive goods, which developments could cause us to incur significant costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n•\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, if we fail to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant accidents or events for which we are insured, or if we fail to rebuild facilities damaged by such accidents or events, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\n•\nUnexpected volume changes due to production variability or to gathering, plant or pipeline system disruptions may increase our exposure to commodity price movements.\n•\nPortions of our pipeline systems may require increased expenditures for maintenance and repair owing to the age of some of our systems, which expenditures or resulting loss of revenue due to pipeline age or condition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n•\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued global and domestic hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations.\n•\nWe face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups.\n•\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity testing programs and related repairs.\n•\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n•\nThe widespread outbreak of pandemics (like COVID-19) or any other public health crisis that impacts the global demand for energy commodities may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Capital Projects and Future Growth\n•\nOur expansion or modification of existing assets or the construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and are subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n•\nIf we do not develop growth projects and/or make acquisitions for expanding existing assets or constructing new assets on economically acceptable terms, or fail to efficiently and effectively integrate developed or acquired assets with our asset base, our future growth will be limited. In addition, any acquisitions we complete are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. In addition, we may not achieve the expected results of any acquisitions and any adverse conditions or developments related to such acquisitions may have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition.\n•\nWe may be unable to cause our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions unless some or all of our joint venture participants agree and certain of our joint venture partners may fail or refuse to fund their respective portions of capital projects that we believe are necessary to expand or maintain such joint venture’s business.\n27\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\n•\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. In addition, potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosure in the future.\n•\nWe are exposed to credit risks of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.\n•\nContinuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy have resulted in and may result in additional increases to the cost of our goods, services and personnel, which in turn cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise.\n•\nChanges in future business conditions could have a negative impact on the demand for our services and could cause recorded long-lived assets to become further impaired, and our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is a negative impact on the demand for our services and an additional impairment of long-lived assets.\n•\nOur hedging activities may not be effective in reducing the variability of our cash flows and may, in certain circumstances, increase the variability of our cash flows. Moreover, our hedges may not fully protect us against volatility in basis differentials. Finally, the percentage of our expected equity commodity volumes that are hedged decreases substantially over time.\n•\nIf we fail to balance our purchases and sales of the commodities we handle, our exposure to commodity price risk will increase.\n•\nThe amounts we pay in dividends may vary from anticipated amounts and circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.\n•\nIf dividends on our shares of common stock are not paid with respect to any fiscal quarter, our stockholders will not be entitled to receive that quarter’s payments in the future.\n•\nOur future tax liability may be greater than expected if our NOL carryforwards are limited, we do not generate expected deductions, or tax authorities successfully challenge certain of our tax positions.\n•\nChanges in tax laws or the interpretation thereof or the imposition of new or increased taxes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n•\nDerivatives legislation and its implementing regulations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\n•\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\n•\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n•\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\n•\nContinued increases in interest rates, due to associated Federal Reserve policies or otherwise, could adversely affect our cost of capital, which could increase our funding costs and reduce the overall profitability of our business.\n•\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect our financial position and we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could collectively increase the risks associated with compliance with our financial covenants.\n•\nThe terms of our debt agreements may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions, including to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\n•\nOur and our customers’ operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide.\n•\nIncreasing stakeholder and market attention to ESG matters may impact our business.\n•\nWe could incur significant costs in complying with more stringent occupational safety and health requirements.\n•\nLaws, regulations and executive orders limiting hydraulic fracturing activities could result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets.\n•\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and a failure to comply or an accidental release into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\n•\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state, tribal or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may (i) cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase or (ii) delay or increase the cost of expansion projects.\n•\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more rigorous enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation.\n•\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\n•\nWe are or may become subject to cybersecurity and data privacy laws, regulations, litigation and directives relating to our processing of personal information.\n28\nRisks Related to our Results of Operations\nOur cash flow is affected by supply and demand for natural gas, NGL products and crude oil and by natural gas, NGL, crude oil and condensate prices, and decreases in commodity prices and/or activity levels could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations can be affected by the level of natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices and the relationship between these prices. The prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil have been volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. Our future cash flows may be materially adversely affected if we experience significant, prolonged price deterioration. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depend upon factors beyond our control. These factors include supply and demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:\n•\nthe impact of seasonality and weather, including severe weather conditions and other natural disasters, such as flooding, droughts and winter storms, the frequency, severity and impact of which could be increased by the effects of climate change;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions and economic conditions impacting our primary markets, including the impact of continued inflation and rising interest rates and associated changes in monetary policy;\n•\nthe economic conditions of our customers;\n•\nthe level of domestic crude oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n•\nthe availability of imported natural gas, liquefied natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n•\nactions taken by major foreign oil and gas producing nations;\n•\nthe availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems and storage for residue natural gas and NGLs;\n•\nthe availability of domestic storage for crude oil;\n•\nthe availability and marketing of competitive fuels and/or feedstocks;\n•\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts and the related transition to a low carbon economy, as a result of the IRA or otherwise;\n•\nstockholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to limit certain sources of funding for the energy sector or restrict the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas; and\n•\nthe extent and nature of governmental regulation and taxation, including those related to the prorationing of oil and gas production.\nOur primary natural gas gathering and processing arrangements that expose us to commodity price risk are our percent-of-proceeds arrangements. Under these arrangements, we generally process natural gas from producers and remit to the producers an agreed percentage of the proceeds from the sale of residue gas and NGL products at market prices or a percentage of residue gas and NGL products at the tailgate of our processing facilities. In some percent-of-proceeds arrangements, we remit to the producer a percentage of an index-based price for residue gas and NGL products, less agreed adjustments, rather than remitting a portion of the actual sales proceeds. Under these types of arrangements, our revenues and cash flows increase or decrease, whichever is applicable, as the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil fluctuate, to the extent our exposure to these prices is unhedged. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nA reduction in demand for NGL products by the petrochemical, refinery or other industries or by the fuel or export markets, or a significant increase in NGL product supply relative to this demand, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe NGL products we produce have a variety of applications, including heating fuels, petrochemical feedstocks and refining blend stocks. A reduction in demand for NGL products, whether because of general or industry-specific economic conditions, new government regulations, including the IRA, global competition, reduced demand by consumers for products made with NGL products (for example, reduced petrochemical demand observed due to lower activity in the automobile and construction industries), reduced demand for propane or butane exports whether for price or other reasons, increased competition from petroleum-based feedstocks due to pricing\n29\ndifferences, mild winter weather for some NGL applications or other reasons, could result in a decline in the volume of NGL products we handle or reduce the fees we charge for our services. Also, increased supply of NGL products could reduce the value of NGLs handled by us and reduce the margins realized. Our NGL products and their demand are affected as follows:\nEthane\n. Ethane is typically supplied as purity ethane and as part of an ethane-propane mix. Ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Although ethane is typically extracted as part of the mixed NGL stream at gas processing plants, if natural gas prices increase significantly in relation to NGL product prices or if the demand for ethylene falls, it may be more profitable for natural gas processors to leave the ethane in the natural gas stream, thereby reducing the volume of NGLs delivered for fractionation and marketing.\nPropane\n. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene, as a heating, engine and industrial\nfuel, and in agricultural applications such as crop drying. Changes in demand for ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for propane. The demand for propane as a heating fuel is significantly affected by weather conditions. The volume of propane sold is increasingly driven by international exports supplying a growing global demand for the product. Domestically in the U.S., propane is at its highest during the six-month peak heating season of October through March. Demand for our propane may be reduced during periods of slow global economic growth and warmer-than-normal weather.\nNormal Butane\n. Normal butane is used in the production of isobutane, as a refined petroleum product blending component, as a fuel gas (either alone or in a mixture with propane) and in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the composition of refined petroleum products resulting from governmental regulation, changes in feedstocks, products and economics, and demand for heating fuel, ethylene and propylene could adversely affect demand for normal butane. The volume of butane sold is increasingly driven by international exports supplying a growing demand for the product.\nIsobutane.\nIsobutane is predominantly used in refineries to produce alkylates to enhance octane levels. Accordingly, any action that reduces demand for motor gasoline or demand for isobutane to produce alkylates for octane enhancement might reduce demand for isobutane.\nNatural Gasoline\n. Natural gasoline is used as a blending component for certain refined petroleum products and as a feedstock used in the production of ethylene and propylene. Changes in the mandated composition of motor gasoline resulting from governmental regulation, and in demand for ethylene and propylene, could adversely affect demand for natural gasoline.\nNGLs and products produced from NGLs also compete with products from global markets. Any reduced demand or increased supply for ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane or natural gasoline in the markets we access for any of the reasons stated above could adversely affect both demand for the services we provide and NGL prices, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe natural decline in production in our operating regions and in other regions from which we source NGL supplies means our long-term success depends on our ability to obtain new sources of supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, which depends on certain factors beyond our control. Any decrease in supplies of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur gathering systems are connected to crude oil and natural gas wells from which production will naturally decline over time, which means that the cash flows associated with these sources of natural gas and crude oil will likely also decline over time. Our logistics assets are similarly impacted by declines in NGL supplies in the regions in which we operate as well as other regions from which we source NGLs. To maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering systems and the utilization rate at our processing plants and our treating and fractionation facilities, we must continually obtain new natural gas, NGL and crude oil supplies. A material decrease in natural gas or crude oil production from producing areas on which we rely, as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of natural gas or crude oil that we gather and process, NGLs that we transport or NGL products delivered to our fractionation facilities. Our ability to obtain additional sources of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depends, in part, on the level of successful drilling and production activity near our gathering systems and, in part, on the level of successful drilling and production in other areas from which we source NGL and crude oil supplies. We have no control over the level of such activity in the areas of our operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. In addition, we have no control over producers or their drilling, completion or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for hydrocarbons, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulations, the availability of drilling rigs, other production and development costs and the availability and cost of capital.\nFluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as crude oil and natural gas prices decrease. Prices of crude oil and natural gas have been historically volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. Consequently, even if new natural gas or crude\n30\noil reserves are discovered in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. For example, low prices for natural gas combined with high levels of natural gas in storage could result in curtailment or shut-in of natural gas production similar to the production shut-ins we experienced in 2020 due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, in response to depressed commodity prices, during 2020 and early 2021 many operators announced substantial reductions in their estimated capital expenditures, rig count and completion crews. Reductions in exploration and production activity, competitor actions or shut-ins by producers in the areas in which we operate may prevent us from obtaining supplies of natural gas or crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, which could result in reduced volumes through our facilities and reduced utilization of our gathering, treating, processing, transportation and fractionation assets.\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe compete with similar enterprises in our respective areas of operation. Some of our competitors are large crude oil, natural gas and NGL companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil than we do. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, storage, terminaling and transportation systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, customers who are significant producers of natural gas may develop their own gathering, processing, storage, terminaling and transportation systems in lieu of using those operated by us. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in areas of high industry activity, which may affect our ability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel needed to manage and operate our business.\nWe operate in areas in which industry activity has increased rapidly. As a result, demand for qualified personnel in these areas, particularly those related to our Permian and Badlands assets, and the cost to attract and retain such personnel, has increased over the past few years due to competition, and may increase substantially in the future. Moreover, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer.\nAny delay or inability to secure the personnel necessary for us to continue or complete our current and planned development projects, or any significant increases in costs with respect to the hiring, training or retention of qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our natural gas and crude oil gathering systems, terminals and processing facilities become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines, storage and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our gathering and processing facilities. Since we do not own or operate these pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation in their current manner is not within our control. If any of these third-party facilities become partially or fully unavailable, or if the quality specifications for their facilities change so as to restrict our ability to utilize them, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe typically do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas or crude oil reserves dedicated to our gathering pipeline systems; therefore, volumes on our systems in the future could be less than we anticipate.\nWe typically do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas or crude oil reserves connected to our gathering systems due to the unwillingness of producers to provide reserve information as well as the cost of such evaluations. Accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our gathering systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. If the total reserves or estimated life of the reserves connected to our gathering systems is less than we anticipate and we are unable to secure additional sources of supply, then the volumes of natural gas or crude oil transported on our gathering systems in the future could be less than we anticipate. A decline in the volumes on our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n31\nWe do not own most of the land on which our pipelines, terminals and compression facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own most of the land on which our pipelines, terminals and compression facilities are located, and we are therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid rights of way or leases or if such rights of way or leases lapse or terminate. We sometimes obtain the rights to land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Additionally, the federal Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that tribal ownership of even a very small fractional interest in an allotted land, that is, tribal land owned or at one time owned by an individual Indian landowner, bars condemnation of any interest in the allotment. Consequently, the inability to condemn such allotted lands under circumstances where an existing pipeline rights of way may soon lapse or terminate serves as an additional impediment for pipeline operators. We cannot guarantee that we will always be able to renew existing rights of way or obtain new rights of way without experiencing significant costs. Any loss of rights with respect to our real property, through our inability to renew rights of way contracts or leases, or otherwise, could cause us to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and reduce our revenue.\nIf we lose any of our named executive officers, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent upon the efforts of our named executive officers. Our named executive officers are responsible for executing our business strategies. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the midstream oil and gas industry. We may not be able to retain our existing named executive officers or fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover. We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our named executive officers. In addition, we do not maintain “key man” life insurance on the lives of any of our named executive officers. A loss of one or more of our named executive officers could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business strategies.\nClimatic events may damage our pipelines and other facilities, limit our ability or increase the costs to operate our business and adversely impact our customers on whom we rely on for throughput as well as third party vendors from whom we receive goods, which developments could cause us to incur significant costs and adversely affect our business, results\nof operations and financial condition.\nClimatic events in the areas in which we or our customers operate can cause disruptions and in some cases suspension of our operations and development activities. For example, unseasonably wet weather, extended periods of below freezing weather, or hurricanes, among other disruptive weather patterns, may cause a loss of throughput from temporary cessation of activities or lost, damaged or ineffective equipment. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated or insured against. Potential climatic changes may have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and wintry conditions and could have an adverse effect on our continued operations as well as the operations of our oil and gas exploration and production customers that deliver natural gas to us for processing and throughput, our third party vendors that supply us with goods, and third party insurance providers that make insuring products available to defray our costs or offset any damages and losses we incur. Any unusual or prolonged severe climatic events or increased frequency thereof, such as freezing weather or rain, earthquakes, hurricanes, droughts, or floods in our oil and gas exploration and production customers’ or our third party vendors’ areas of operations or markets, whether due to climatic change or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations along the Gulf Coast, in offshore waters and at major river crossings in particular could be adversely impacted by changing climatic conditions, as rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion are potential causes for serious damage to our pipelines and other facilities, which could affect our ability to provide services. These damages could result in leakage, migration, releases or spills from our operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water, groundwater or to the Gulf of Mexico and could result in liability, remedial obligations or otherwise have a negative impact on continued operations. Additionally, rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion processes could impact our oil and gas exploration and production customers who operate along the Gulf Coast, and they may be unable to utilize our services. Adverse climatic impacts, whether inland or along the coast or offshore, could also affect our third-party suppliers, which could limit their ability to provide us with the necessary products and services enabling us to maintain operation of our pipelines and other facilities. As a result, we may incur significant costs to repair, preserve or make more efficient our pipeline infrastructure and other facilities. Such costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, we could incur significant costs to weatherize or upgrade weatherization of our facility equipment in anticipation of future climatic events. For example, following Texas Governor Greg Abbott's direction to adopt rules related to weather resiliency, in August 2022, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted the Weather Emergency Preparedness Standards rule, which requires critical gas facilities on the state’s Electricity Supply Chain Map (including gas pipelines that directly serve electricity generation) to (i) weatherize to help ensure sustained operations during a weather emergency, (ii) correct known issues that caused weather-related forced stoppages and (iii) contact the Texas Railroad Commission if a facility sustains a weather-related forced stoppage during a weather emergency. Inspectors from the Critical Infrastructure Division of the Texas Railroad Commission began inspections on December 1, 2022. If, upon inspection,\n32\nwe are required to further weatherize or update weatherization of certain facilities, we may incur significant costs to complete any additional weatherization. Additionally, issues beyond our control, such as grid reliability or the severity of any such weather event, might undermine any winterization or emergency weather preparedness efforts we make. Furthermore, our operations in western Texas and New Mexico may be sensitive to drought and restrictions on water use.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not fully insured, if we fail to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant accidents or events for which we are insured, or if we fail to rebuild facilities damaged by such accidents or events, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards inherent in purchasing, gathering, compressing, treating, processing and/or selling natural gas; storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling NGLs and NGL products; and purchasing, gathering, storing and/or terminaling crude oil, including:\n•\ndamage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, explosions and acts of terrorism;\n•\ninadvertent damage from third parties, including from motor vehicles and construction, farm or utility equipment;\n•\ndamage that is the result of our negligence or any of our employees’ negligence;\n•\nleaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas or NGLs as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;\n•\nspills or other unauthorized releases of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, other hydrocarbons or waste materials that contaminate the environment, including soils, surface water and groundwater, and otherwise adversely impact natural resources; and\n•\nother hazards that could also result in personal injury, loss of life, pollution and/or suspension of operations.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury, loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental or natural resource damage, and may result in delay, curtailment or suspension of our related operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We are not fully insured against all risks inherent to our business. Additionally, while we are insured against pollution resulting from environmental accidents that occur on a sudden and accidental basis, we may not be insured against all environmental accidents that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, if we fail to recover all anticipated insurance proceeds for significant accidents or events for which we are insured, or if we fail to rebuild facilities damaged by such accidents or events, our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. For example, following the occurrence of severe hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf Coast in recent years, insurance premiums, deductibles and co-insurance requirements increased substantially, and terms were generally less favorable than terms that could be obtained prior to such hurricanes, with some coverage unavailable at any cost.\nUnexpected volume changes due to production variability or to gathering, plant or pipeline system disruptions may increase our exposure to commodity price movements.\nWe sell processed natural gas at plant tailgates or at pipeline pooling points. Sales made to natural gas marketers and end-users may be interrupted by disruptions to volumes anywhere along the system. We attempt to balance sales with volumes supplied from processing operations, but unexpected volume variations due to production variability or to gathering, plant or pipeline system disruptions may expose us to volume imbalances which, in conjunction with movements in commodity prices, could materially impact our income from operations and cash flow.\n33\nPortions of our pipeline systems may require increased expenditures for maintenance and repair owing to the age of some of our systems, which expenditures or resulting loss of revenue due to pipeline age or condition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSome portions of the pipeline systems that we operate have been in service for several decades\nprior to our purchase of them. Consequently, there may be historical occurrences or latent issues regarding our pipeline systems that our executive management may be unaware of and that may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The age and condition of some of our pipeline systems could also result in increased maintenance or repair expenditures, and any downtime associated with increased maintenance and repair activities could materially reduce our revenue. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenditures or loss of revenue due to the age or condition of some portions of our pipeline systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued global and domestic hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe long-term impact of terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and the threat of future terrorist attacks on our industry in general and on us in particular is not known at this time. However, resulting regulatory requirements and/or related business decisions associated with security are likely to increase our costs. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued global and domestic hostilities may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for our products, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets, or indirect casualties, of an act of terror.\nChanges in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage or coverage may be reduced or unavailable. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital.\nWe face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups.\nWe have experienced, and may encounter from time to time, opposition to the operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, non-governmental environmental organizations and groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. In some instances, we encounter opposition which disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. Opposition to our operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay, denial or termination of required governmental permits or approvals, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt, delay or terminate the operation or expansion of our assets and business. Similar actions pursued against our oil and gas customers could result in interruptions or limitations to their businesses, which could reduce demand for our services. Any such event that restricts, delays or prevents the expansion of our or our customers’ businesses, interrupts the revenues generated by our or our customers’ operations or causes us or our customers to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as reduce the demand for our services. Increased regulatory attention to environmental justice matters at the federal and state level may also provide communities opposed to our operations with greater opportunities to challenge or delay the permitting approval process.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity testing programs and related repairs.\nPursuant to the authority under the NGPSA and HLPSA, PHMSA has established rules requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines located where a pipeline leak or rupture could affect higher and moderate consequence risk areas, known as HCAs and MCAs, which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences. Among other things, these regulations require operators of covered pipelines to:\n•\nperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n•\nidentify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact an HCA, MCA or Class 3 or 4 area;\n•\nmaintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;\n•\nrepair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and\n•\nimplement preventive and mitigating actions.\n34\nWith adoption of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Pipeline Safety Act”), the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“2016 Pipeline Safety Act”) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (“PIPES”) Act of 2020 over the past decade, existing mandates require PHMSA to impose more stringent pipeline safety standards. As a result of those legislative enactments, PHMSA has issued several significant rulemakings. For example, more recently, in November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule establishing two new classes of onshore gas gathering pipelines—Type R and Type C—and imposed safety regulations on approximately 400,000 miles of previously unregulated onshore gas gathering lines that, among other things, established criteria for inspection and repair of fugitive emissions, extended reporting requirements to all gas gathering operators and applied a set of minimum safety requirements to certain gas gathering pipelines with large diameters and high operating pressures. Separately, in June 2021, PHMSA issued an Advisory Bulletin advising pipeline and pipeline facility operators of applicable requirements to update their inspection and maintenance plans for the elimination of hazardous leaks and minimization of natural gas released from pipeline facilities. PHMSA, together with state regulators, were expected to commence inspection of operator plans in 2022. In August 2022, PHMSA finalized additional pipeline safety rules, which adjusted the repair criteria for pipelines in HCAs, created new criteria for pipelines in non-HCAs, and strengthened integrity management assessment requirements, among other items. The integrity-related requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act, and the PIPES Act of 2020, as well as any implementation of PHMSA rules thereunder, could require us to pursue additional capital projects or conduct integrity or maintenance programs on an accelerated basis and incur increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our costs of transportation services as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain states, including Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and North Dakota, where we conduct operations, have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations for certain intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. We plan to continue our pipeline integrity inspection programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The results of these inspections may cause us to incur material and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct business. For example, we depend on digital technologies to operate our facilities, serve our customers and record financial data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. In May 2021, a ransomware attack on a major U.S. refined products pipeline forced the operator to temporarily shut down the pipeline, resulting in disruption of fuel supplies along the East Coast. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers, customers and other business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or could adversely disrupt our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to enhance our security posture and cybersecurity defenses or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to or consequences of cyber incidents. Our insurance coverages for cyber-attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of a cyber incident.\nThe widespread outbreak pandemics (like COVID-19) or any other public health crisis that impacts the global demand for energy commodities may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe face risks related to the outbreak of illnesses, pandemics and other public health crises that are outside of our control and could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel bans, prohibitions on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing in addition to other actions taken by both businesses and governments, resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity.\n35\nSince the beginning of 2021, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines progressed and many government-imposed restrictions were relaxed or rescinded. However, we continue to monitor the effects of the pandemic on our operations. Our results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which our operating and financial results are affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the emergence of more contagious and harmful variants of the COVID-19 virus, the duration and scope of the pandemic, additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate the other risk factors that we identify herein. While the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have lessened recently in the United States, we cannot predict the duration or future effects of the pandemic, or more contagious and harmful variants of the COVID-19 virus, and such effects may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nRisks Related to our Capital Projects and Future Growth\nOur expansion or modification of existing assets or the construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and are subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all. For example, the construction of additional systems may be delayed or require greater capital investment if the commodity prices of certain supplies, such as steel pipe, increase due to imposed tariffs. Moreover, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, fractionation facility or gas processing plant, the construction may occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed. Moreover, we may construct pipelines or facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. Since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas and oil reserves, we do not possess reserve expertise and we often do not have access to third-party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing pipelines or facilities in such area. To the extent we rely on estimates of future production in any decision to construct additions to our systems, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production. As a result, new pipelines or facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the construction of additions to our existing gathering and transportation assets may require us to obtain new rights of way prior to constructing new pipelines. We may be unable to obtain or renew such rights of way to connect new natural gas and crude oil supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights of way or to renew existing rights of way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights of way increases, our cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not develop growth projects and/or make acquisitions for expanding existing assets or constructing new assets on economically acceptable terms, or fail to efficiently and effectively integrate developed or acquired assets with our asset base, our future growth will be limited. In addition, any acquisitions we complete are subject to substantial risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. In addition, we may not achieve the expected results of any acquisitions and any adverse conditions or developments related to such acquisitions may have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to grow depends, in part, on our ability to develop growth projects and/or make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash generated from operations. If we are unable to develop accretive growth projects or make accretive acquisitions because we are unable to (1) develop growth projects economically or identify attractive acquisition candidates and negotiate acceptable acquisition agreements or, (2) obtain financing for these projects or acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, or (3) compete successfully for growth projects or acquisitions, then our future growth and ability to return increasing capital to our shareholders may be limited.\nAny growth project or acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n•\noperating a significantly larger combined organization and adding new or expanded operations;\n•\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the growth projects or acquired businesses, especially if the assets developed or acquired are in a new business segment and/or geographic area;\n•\nthe risk that crude oil and natural gas reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n36\n•\nthe failure to realize expected volumes, revenues, profitability or growth;\n•\nthe failure to realize any expected synergies and cost savings;\n•\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n•\nthe assumption of environmental and other unknown liabilities;\n•\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller in an acquisition or the contractors and suppliers in growth projects;\n•\nthe failure to attain or maintain compliance with environmental and other governmental regulations;\n•\ninaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt or the tightening of capital markets and access to new capital;\n•\nthe diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;\n•\nchallenges associated with joint venture relationships and minority investments, including dependence on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours; and\n•\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses or to a competitor.\nIf these risks materialize, any growth project or acquired assets may inhibit our growth, fail to deliver expected benefits and/or add further unexpected costs. Challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of a growth project or acquisition if we fail to successfully integrate such businesses, including the Delaware Basin Acquisition and South Texas Acquisition, with our operations. If we consummate any future growth project or acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future growth projects or acquisitions.\nOur growth and acquisition strategy is based, in part, on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of energy assets by industry participants and new opportunities created by industry expansion. A material decrease in such divestitures or in opportunities for economic commercial expansion would limit our opportunities for future growth projects or acquisitions and could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.\nGrowth projects may increase our concentration in a line of business or geographic region and acquisitions may significantly increase our size and diversify the geographic areas in which we operate. In addition, we may not achieve the desired effect from any future growth projects or acquisitions.\nWe may be unable to cause our joint ventures to take or not to take certain actions unless some or all of our joint venture participants agree.\nWe participate in several joint ventures whose corporate governance structures require at least a majority in interest vote to authorize many basic activities and require a greater voting interest (sometimes up to 100%) to authorize more significant activities. Examples of these more significant activities include, among others, large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction or acquisition of assets, borrowing money or otherwise raising capital, making distributions, transactions with affiliates of a joint venture participant, litigation and transactions not in the ordinary course of business. Without the concurrence of joint venture participants with enough voting interests, we may be unable to cause any of our joint ventures to take or not take certain actions, even though taking or preventing those actions may be in our best interests or the particular joint venture.\nIn addition, subject to certain conditions, any joint venture owner may sell, transfer or otherwise modify its ownership interest in a joint venture, whether in a transaction involving third parties or the other joint owners. Any such transaction could result in our partnering with different or additional parties.\n37\nWe may operate a portion of our business with one or more joint venture partners where we own a minority interest and/or are not the operator, which may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility. Actions taken by the other partner or third-party operator may materially impact our financial position and results of operations, and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from a joint venture.\nAs is common in the midstream industry, we may operate one or more of our properties with one or more joint venture partners where we own a minority interest and/or contract with a third party to control operations. These relationships could require us to share operational and other control, such that we may no longer have the flexibility to control completely the development of these properties. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments in such circumstances, our rights to participate may be adversely affected. If a joint venture partner is unable or fails to pay its portion of development costs or if a third-party operator does not operate in accordance with our expectations, our costs of operations could be increased. We could also incur liability as a result of actions taken by a joint venture partner or third-party operator. Disputes between us and the other party may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. In addition, potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosure in the future.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide timely and reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide timely and reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We continue to enhance our internal controls and financial reporting capabilities. These enhancements require a significant commitment of resources, personnel and the development and maintenance of formalized internal reporting procedures to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Our efforts to update and maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting now or in the future, including future compliance with the obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nAny failure to maintain effective controls or difficulties encountered in the effective improvement of our internal controls could prevent us from timely and reliably reporting our financial results and may harm our operating results. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Any significant change in accounting standards or disclosure requirements could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to comply with our debt obligations.\nWe are exposed to credit risks of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nMany of our customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness, especially in a depressed commodity price environment. A decline in natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices may adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations, creditworthiness, cash flows and prospects of some of our customers. Severe financial problems encountered by our customers could limit our ability to collect amounts owed to us, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from a decline in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of our customers’ liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to us. Additionally, a decline in the share price of some of our public customers may place them in danger of becoming delisted from a public securities exchange, limiting their access to the public capital markets and further restricting their liquidity. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. To the extent one or more of our key customers is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with these customers may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Furthermore, some bankruptcy courts have found that, in certain cases oil, gas and water gathering agreements do not create covenants running with the land under governing law and are thus subject to rejection in Chapter 11 proceedings. Whether a particular contract is subject to rejection depends on the wording of the contract, the governing law and the forum where a particular bankruptcy case is filed. Financial problems experienced by our customers could result in the impairment of our long-lived assets, reduction of our operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of our products and services, which could reduce our revenues. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers or our derivative counterparties could reduce our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.\n38\nContinuing or worsening inflationary issues and associated changes in monetary policy have resulted in and may result in additional increases to the cost of our goods, services and personnel, which in turn cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise.\nThe U.S. inflation rate increased in 2021, 2022 and into 2023. These inflationary pressures have resulted in and may result in additional increases to the costs of our goods, services and personnel, which in turn cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Sustained levels of high inflation have likewise caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates multiple times in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised and may continue to raise benchmark interest rates in 2023 in an effort to curb inflationary pressure on the costs of goods and services across the U.S., which could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either of which—or the combination thereof—could negatively impact the financial and operating results of our business. To the extent elevated inflation remains, we may experience further cost increases for our operations, including services, labor costs and equipment if our operating activity increases.\nHigher oil and natural gas prices may cause the costs of materials and services to continue to rise. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation and a significant increase in inflation, to the extent we are unable to recover higher costs through higher prices and revenues, would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in future business conditions could have a negative impact on the demand for our services and could cause recorded long-lived assets to become further impaired, and our financial condition and results of operations could suffer if there is a negative impact on the demand for our services and an additional impairment of long-lived assets\n.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including related intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. These cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost and other factors. Global oil and natural gas commodity prices, particularly crude oil, remain volatile. Decreases in commodity prices have previously had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on the demand for our services and our market capitalization.\nShould energy industry conditions deteriorate, there is a possibility that long-lived assets may be impaired in a future period. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment of $452.3 million primarily associated with the partial impairment of gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our Central operations in our Gathering and Processing segment. Any additional impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our financial statements. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of long-lived assets. For further discussion of our impairments of long-lived assets, see Note 5 — Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets of the “Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this Annual Report.\nOur hedging activities may not be effective in reducing the variability of our cash flows and may, in certain circumstances, increase the variability of our cash flows. Moreover, our hedges may not fully protect us against volatility in basis differentials. Finally, the percentage of our expected equity commodity volumes that are hedged decreases substantially over time.\nWe have entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of our equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk. As a result, we will continue to have direct commodity price risk to the unhedged portion. Our actual future volumes may be significantly higher or lower than we estimated at the time we entered into the derivative transactions for that period. If the actual amount is higher than we estimated, we will have greater commodity price risk than we intended. If the actual amount is lower than the amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity. The percentages of our expected equity volumes that are covered by our hedges decrease over time. To the extent we hedge our commodity price risk, we may forego the benefits we would otherwise experience if commodity prices were to change in our favor. The derivative instruments we utilize for these hedges are based on posted market prices, which may be higher or lower than the actual natural gas, NGL and condensate prices that we realize in our operations. These pricing differentials may be substantial and could materially impact the prices we ultimately realize. Market and economic conditions may adversely affect our hedge counterparties’ ability to meet their obligations. Given volatility in the financial and commodity markets, we may experience defaults by our hedge counterparties. In addition, our exchange traded futures are subject to margin requirements, which creates variability in our cash flows as commodity prices fluctuate.\nAs a result of these and other factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the variability of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the variability of our cash flows. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\n39\nIf we fail to balance our purchases and sales of the commodities we handle, our exposure to commodity price risk will increase.\nWe may not be successful in balancing our purchases and sales of the commodities we handle. In addition, a producer could fail to deliver promised volumes to us or deliver in excess of contracted volumes, or a purchaser could purchase less than contracted volumes. Any of these actions could cause an imbalance between our purchases and sales. If our purchases and sales are not balanced, we will face increased exposure to commodity price risks and could have increased volatility in our operating income.\nThe amounts we pay in dividends may vary from anticipated amounts and circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.\nThe determination of the amounts of cash dividends, if any, to be declared and paid will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the level of our capital expenditures, future business prospects and any other matters that our board of directors, in consultation with management, deems relevant. Many of these matters are affected by factors beyond our control and therefore, the actual amount of cash that is available for dividends to our stockholders may vary from anticipated amounts.\nAdditionally, as events present themselves or become reasonably foreseeable, our board of directors, which determines our business strategy and our dividends, may decide to address those matters by utilizing capital that may otherwise be used for our dividend. For example, in March 2020, our board of directors approved a reduction in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.10 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and maintained such dividend amount through the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Our board of directors may also determine that an increase in our dividend is appropriate. If we issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or we incur debt, the payment of dividends on those additional shares or interest on that debt could increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our cash dividend levels.\nIf dividends on our shares of common stock are not paid with respect to any fiscal quarter, our stockholders will not be entitled to receive that quarter’s payments in the future.\nDividends to our common stockholders are not cumulative. Consequently, if dividends on our shares of common stock are not paid with respect to any fiscal quarter, our stockholders will not be entitled to receive that quarter’s payments in the future.\nOur future tax liability may be greater than expected if our NOL carryforwards are limited, we do not generate expected deductions, or tax authorities successfully challenge certain of our tax positions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $6.8 billion, some of which expire between 2036 to 2037 while others have no expiration date. Subject to the CAMT discussed below, we expect to be able to utilize these NOL carryforwards and generate deductions to offset all or a portion of our future taxable income. This expectation is based upon assumptions we have made regarding, among other things, our income, capital expenditures and net working capital, and the current expectation that our NOL carryforwards will not become subject to future limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”).\nSection 382 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an “ownership change” (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders (or groups of stockholders) who are each deemed to own at least 5% of our stock change their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. In the event that an ownership change were to occur, utilization of our NOLs carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382, subject to certain adjustments.\nWhile we expect to be able to utilize our NOL carryforwards and generate deductions to offset all or a portion of our future taxable income (subject to the CAMT discussed below), in the event that deductions are not generated as expected, one or more of our tax positions are successfully challenged by the IRS (in a tax audit or otherwise) or our NOL carryforwards are subject to future limitations under Section 382, our future tax liability may be greater than expected.\n40\nChanges in tax laws or the interpretation thereof or the imposition of new or increased taxes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. federal and state legislation is periodically proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws and could materially increase our tax obligations, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA which includes, among other things, the CAMT. Under the CAMT, a 15% minimum tax will be imposed on certain financial statement income of “applicable corporations.” The IRA treats a corporation as an applicable corporation in any taxable year in which the “average annual adjusted financial statement income” of such corporation for the three taxable year period ending prior to such taxable year exceeds $1 billion.\nBased on our current interpretation of the IRA, the CAMT and related guidance and a number of operational, economic, accounting and regulatory assumptions, we do not anticipate being an applicable corporation in the near term, but we are likely to become an applicable corporation in a subsequent tax year. If we become an applicable corporation and our CAMT liability is greater than our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for any particular tax year, the CAMT liability would effectively accelerate our future U.S. federal income tax obligations, reducing our cash available for distribution in that year, but provide an offsetting credit against our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a future year. As a result, our current expectation is that the impact of the CAMT is limited to timing differences in future tax years.\nThe foregoing analysis is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the IRA, the CAMT and related guidance. In the future the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service are expected to release regulations and additional interpretive guidance relating to such legislation, and any significant variance from our current interpretation could result in a change in our analysis of the application of the CAMT to us.\nDerivatives legislation and its implementing regulations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\"), enacted in July 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act required the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, and most of these regulations have been finalized.\nIn October 2020, the CFTC adopted new rules that will place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain\nbona fide\nhedging transactions. The new rules became effective in December 2020 but have a general compliance date of January 1, 2022 for covered future positions and January 1, 2023 for covered swaps positions. We have not experienced a material impediment to, and do not expect these regulations to materially impede, our hedging activity at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. The CFTC and the federal banking regulators have adopted regulations requiring certain counterparties to swaps to post initial and variation margin. However, our current hedging activities would qualify for the non-financial end user exemption from the margin requirements.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts or potentially reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.\nAny of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nThe European Union (the “EU”) and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are also implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we enter into swaps with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions or counterparties with other businesses that subject them to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, we may be impacted by such regulations. The implementing regulations adopted by the EU and by other non-U.S. jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\n41\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe or our stockholders may sell shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities. As of December 31, 2022, we had 226,042,229 outstanding shares of common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including provisions which require:\n•\na classified board of directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors are elected each year;\n•\nlimitations on the removal of directors; and\n•\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.\nDelaware law prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any “interested stockholder,” meaning generally that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations and powers, preferences, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nContinued increases in interest rates, due to associated Federal Reserve policies or otherwise, could adversely affect our cost of capital, which could increase our funding costs and reduce the overall profitability of our business.\nWe have significant exposure to increases in interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, our total indebtedness was $11,610.4 million, excluding $8.4 million of unamortized discounts and $65.6 million of debt issuance costs, of which $7,784.4 million was at fixed interest rates, $3,598.7 million was at variable interest rates and $227.3 million consisted of finance lease liabilities. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in the rate of our variable interest rate debt would impact our consolidated annual interest expense by $36.0 million based on our December 31, 2022 debt balances. We additionally had $1.4 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under the TRGP Revolver after accounting for $33.2 million of letters of credit, under which borrowing is exposed to such increases in variable interest rates. As a result of our variable interest debt, our\nresults of operations could be adversely affected by increases in interest rates, due to associated Federal Reserve policies or otherwise.\nAdditionally, like all equity investments, an investment in our equity securities is subject to certain risks. In exchange for accepting these risks, investors may expect to receive a higher rate of return than would otherwise be obtainable from lower-risk investments. Accordingly, as interest rates rise, the ability of investors to obtain higher risk-adjusted rates of return by purchasing government-backed debt securities may cause a corresponding decline in demand for riskier investments generally, including yield-based equity investments.\n42\nReduced demand for our common stock resulting from investors seeking other more favorable investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which may adversely affect our financial position and we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could collectively increase the risks associated with compliance with our financial covenants.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.8 billion outstanding TRGP senior unsecured notes, excluding $8.4 million of unamortized discounts and $5.0 billion outstanding of the Partnership’s senior unsecured notes. We also had $800.0 million outstanding under the Securitization Facility. In addition, we had (i) $1.5 billion of borrowing outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, and (ii) $290.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the TRGP Revolver, $33.2 million of letters of credit outstanding, $1,008.7 million of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and $1.4 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under the TRGP Revolver. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our consolidated interest expense, net was $446.1 million, $387.9 million and $391.3 million.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness, combined with lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences to us, including the following:\n•\nour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n•\nsatisfying our obligations with respect to indebtedness may be more difficult and any failure to comply with the obligations of any debt instruments could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n•\nwe will need a portion of cash flow to make interest payments on debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities;\n•\nour debt level may influence how counterparties view our creditworthiness, which could limit our ability to enter into commercial transactions at favorable rates or require us to post additional collateral in commercial transactions;\n•\nour debt level will make us more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n•\nour debt level may limit flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic conditions.\nOur long-term unsecured debt is currently rated by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. As of December 31, 2022, Targa’s senior unsecured debt was rated “BBB-” by Fitch, “Baa3” by Moody’s and “BBB-” by S&P. Any future downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of raising capital, and a downgrade could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy and to access capital in the public markets.\nOur International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) agreements contain credit-risk related contingent features. Following the release of the collateral securing our TRGP Revolver as a result of our credit rating, our derivative positions are no longer secured. As of December 31, 2022, we have outstanding net derivative positions that contain credit-risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position of $266.7 million. If our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, as defined in our ISDAs, we estimate that as of December 31, 2022, we would be required to post $31.4 million of collateral to certain counterparties per the terms of our ISDAs.\nOur ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, investments or capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital, and such results may adversely affect our ability to make cash dividends. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The TRGP Revolver provides an available commitment of $2.75 billion and allows us to request increases in commitments up to an additional $500.0 million. Although our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur additional debt, this could increase the risks associated with compliance with our financial covenants.\n43\nThe terms of our debt agreements may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in business or to take certain actions, including to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain, and any future indebtedness we incur will likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. These agreements include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n•\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue additional preferred stock;\n•\npay dividends on our equity securities or to our equity holders or redeem, repurchase or retire our equity securities or subordinated indebtedness;\n•\nmake investments and certain acquisitions;\n•\nsell or transfer assets, including equity securities of our subsidiaries;\n•\nengage in affiliate transactions;\n•\nconsolidate or merge;\n•\nincur liens;\n•\nprepay, redeem and repurchase certain debt, subject to certain exceptions;\n•\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions or take-or-pay contracts; and\n•\nchange business activities conducted by us.\nIn addition, certain of our debt agreements require us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios and tests.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our debt agreements. Upon the occurrence of such an event of default, all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable and all applicable commitments to extend further credit could be terminated. If we are unable to repay the accelerated debt under the Securitization Facility, the lenders under the Securitization Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. We have pledged the accounts receivables of Targa Receivables LLC under the Securitization Facility. If the indebtedness under our debt agreements is accelerated, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in these debt agreements and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nOur and our customers’ operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers, are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, though recent laws such as the IRA advance numerous climate-related objectives. However, because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from\n44\ncertain petroleum and natural gas system sources, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. Additionally, in August 2022, the IRA was signed into law, which appropriates significant federal funding for renewable energy initiatives and amends the federal Clean Air Act to impose a first-time fee on the emission of methane from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including those sources in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025, and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA. The methane emissions fee and renewable and low carbon energy funding provisions of the law could increase our and our customers’ operating costs and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, which could in turn reduce demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions. In response to President Biden's executive order calling on the EPA to revisit federal regulations regarding methane in November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and establish Subpart OOOOb to expand emissions reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including certain source types not previously regulated under Subpart OOOOa. In addition, the proposed rule would create a new Subpart OOOOc which would require states to develop plans to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. This proposed rule would apply to upstream and midstream facilities at oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements, operations and maintenance requirements, and so-called green well completion requirements. In November 2022, the EPA published a supplemental methane proposal, which, among other items, sets forth specific revisions strengthening the first nationwide emission guidelines for states to limit methane emissions from existing crude oil and natural gas facilities. The proposal also revises requirements for fugitive emissions monitoring and repair as well as equipment leaks and the frequency of monitoring surveys, establishes a “super-emitter” response program to timely mitigate emissions events, and provides additional options for the use of advanced monitoring to encourage the deployment of innovative technologies to detect and reduce methane emissions. The proposal is currently subject to public comment and is expected to be finalized in 2023; however, it is likely that these requirements will be subject to legal challenges. While we cannot predict the final scope or compliance costs of these proposed regulatory requirements, any such requirements have the potential to increase our operating costs and thus may adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nVarious states and groups of states have also adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on areas of coverage similar to what the federal government has or may consider, including GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. Moreover, the international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (“COP26”), during which the multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. Relatedly, at COP26, the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 countries joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. At COP27 in Sharm El-Sheik in November 2022, countries reiterated the agreements from COP26 and were called upon to accelerate efforts toward the phase out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. The US also announced, in conjunction with the European Union and other partner countries, that it would develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Although no firm commitment or timeline to phase out or phase down all fossil fuels was made at COP27, there can be no guarantees that countries will not seek to implement such a phase out in the future. The impacts of these actions, orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States’ commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, COP27, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time and it is unclear what additional initiatives may be adopted or implemented that may have adverse effects on our operations.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, that may limit hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells, restrict flaring and venting during natural gas production on federal properties, and ban or restrict new or existing leases for production of minerals on federal properties. President Biden has issued several executive orders and strategies focused on addressing climate change, including items that may impact costs to produce, or demand for, oil and gas. Other actions relating to oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued by the Biden Administration may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas export facilities. For example, in November 2022 the BLM proposed a rule that\n45\nwould limit flaring from well sites on federal lands, as well as allow the delay or denial of permits if BLM finds that an operator’s methane waste minimization plan is insufficient. The Biden Administration has also called for revisions and restrictions to the leasing and permitting programs for oil and gas development on federal lands and, for a time, suspended federal oil and gas leasing activities. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s comprehensive review of the federal leasing program resulted in a reduction in the volume of onshore land held for lease and an increased royalty rate. Any regulatory changes that restrict or require modifications to our or our suppliers’ existing operations or future expansions plans could reduce the demand for the products and services we provide, increase our operating costs and may have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nLitigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments, and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. Should we be targeted by any similar litigation, involvement in such a case could have adverse financial and reputational impacts and an unfavorable ruling could significantly impact our operations and adversely impact our financial condition.\nAdditionally, our access to capital may be impacted by climate change policies. Stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies but concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies have also become more attentive to sustainability lending practices that favor “clean” power sources such as wind and solar photovoltaic, making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and natural gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding to the fossil fuel sector. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector and, in September 2022, the Federal Reserve announced that six of the U.S.’ largest banks will participate in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise to enhance the ability of firms and supervisors to measure and mange climate-related financial risk. The Federal Reserve released its pilot exercise in January 2023 which is designed to analyze the impact of both physical and transition risks related to climate change on specific assets of the banks’ portfolios. While we cannot predict what policies may result from these developments, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could impact our and our suppliers’ and customers’ businesses and operations. In addition, in March 2022, the SEC released a proposed rule that would establish a framework for the reporting of climate risks, targets, and metrics. A final rule is anticipated to be released by Q2 2023. Although the final form and substance of this rule and its requirements are not yet known and its ultimate impact on our business is uncertain, the proposed rule, if finalized, may result in increased legal, accounting and financial compliance costs for us and our suppliers and customers related to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks. We may also face increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rule if finalized as proposed. In addition, enhanced climate disclosure requirements could accelerate the trend of certain stakeholders and lenders in restricting or seeking more stringent conditions with respect to their investments in our customers in the energy industry and companies like ours that support the energy industry. Separately, the SEC has also announced that it is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege an issuer’s existing climate disclosures misleading or deficient.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our services and products. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nFinally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other extreme climatic events, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. These climatic developments have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets and those of our suppliers and customers and thus could have an adverse effect on our operations and supply chain, including resulting in changes to costs associated with maintaining or insuring our assets. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may result in changes to the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy or the products our customers\n46\nproduce. While our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design is intended to reduce the uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce, our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the effectiveness of our facilities and our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning, which may not have considered or be prepared for every eventuality. If any such effects of climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers.\nIncreasing stakeholder and market attention to ESG matters may impact our business.\nIncreasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our customers’ products and our services, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our or our customers’ hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against us or those customers.\nAs part of our ongoing effort to enhance our ESG practices, our Board of Directors has established a Sustainability Committee. Committee members oversee management’s implementation of ESG policies and provide insight to the Board on the effectiveness of integrating sustainability into our various business activities. We have also appointed a senior vice president of sustainability, who reports directly to our CEO and also regularly provides reports on relevant ESG matters to our Board of Directors. We also published our 2021 Sustainability Report, which provides updates on our performance related to certain ESG topics and sets certain ESG goals, such as reductions in methane intensity in line with the ONE Future goals. While we may elect to seek out various additional voluntary ESG targets now or in the future, such targets are aspirational. Moreover, despite our governance oversight in place, we may not be able to adequately identify ESG-related risks and opportunities and, further, may not be able to meet ESG targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, or at all, including as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results. Moreover, ESG-related actions or statements that we may make or take are sometimes based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable, but which may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Moreover, to the extent we elected to pursue such targets and were able to achieve the desired target levels, such achievement may have been accomplished as a result of entering into various contractual arrangements, including the purchase of various credits or offsets that may be deemed to mitigate our ESG impact instead of actual changes in our ESG performance. However, we cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient offsets for purchase or that, notwithstanding our reliance on any reputable third party registries, that the offsets we do purchase will successfully achieve the emissions reductions they represent. Notwithstanding our election to pursue aspirational targets now or in the future, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Additionally, we and other companies in our industry publish sustainability reports that are made available to investors. Such ratings and reports are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us or our customers and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and/or our access to and costs of capital. Also, certain institutional lenders may decide not to provide funding to us or our customers’ companies based on ESG concerns, which could adversely affect our financial condition and access to capital for potential growth projects. Increasingly, investors, lenders, and other stakeholders are focusing on issues related to environmental justice, which may result in increased scrutiny of our applicable regulatory processes and additional costs of compliance.\nFurthermore, public statements with respect to ESG matters, such as emissions reduction goals, other environmental targets, or other commitments addressing certain social issues, are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities related to the risk of potential “greenwashing,” i.e., misleading information or false claims overstating potential ESG benefits. Certain non-governmental organizations and other private actors have also filed lawsuits under various securities and consumer protection laws alleging that certain ESG-statements, goals, or standards were misleading, false, or otherwise deceptive. As a result, we may face increased litigation risks from private parties and governmental authorities related to our ESG efforts. In addition, any alleged claims of greenwashing against us or others in our industry may lead to further negative sentiment and diversion of investments. Additionally, we expect there will likely be increasing levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to ESG matters, and we could face increasing costs as we attempt to comply with and navigate further regulatory ESG-related focus and scrutiny.\nWe could incur significant costs in complying with more stringent occupational safety and health requirements.\nWe are subject to stringent federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (“OSHA”) hazard communication standard, the EPA\n47\ncommunity right-to-know regulations under Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We and the entities in which we own an interest are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any newly adopted laws or regulations may result in assessment of sanctions including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws, regulations and executive orders limiting hydraulic fracturing activities could result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets.\nWhile we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing, many of our oil and gas exploration and production customers do perform such activities. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over, proposed or promulgated regulations governing, and conducted investigations relating to certain aspects of the process, including the EPA.\nIn addition, Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, President Biden issued an executive order in January 2021 suspending the issuance of new leases on federal lands and waters pending completion of a study of current oil and gas practices but, in August 2022, a U.S. District Court issued a permanent injunction that blocked President Biden’s order suspending new leases. Litigation concerning this issue remains pending. Notwithstanding these recent legal developments, further restrictions may be adopted by the Biden Administration that could restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands and waters. Many states have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including in states where we or our customers conduct operations. States could further elect to suspend or prohibit hydraulic fracturing activities in the future. While governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, non-governmental organizations may also seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing through ballot initiatives, such as those that have been pursued in Colorado. New or more stringent laws, regulations, executive orders or regulatory or ballot initiatives relating to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to our customers reducing crude oil and natural gas drilling activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques, while increased public opposition to activities using such techniques may result in operational delays, restrictions, cessations, or increased litigation. Any one or more of such developments could reduce demand for our gathering, processing and fractionation services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and a failure to comply or an accidental release into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, tribal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities, restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; limitation or prohibition of construction and operating activities in environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, urban areas, wilderness regions and other protected areas; requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements, and imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and BLM, and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits and approvals issued under them, which can often require difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any newly adopted laws or regulations may result in assessment of sanctions including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining or conditioning performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area. Certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or waste products have been released, even under circumstances where the substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been released by a predecessor operator or the activities conducted and from which a release emanated complied with applicable law. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by noise, odor, or the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes into the environment.\nThe risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations is significant due to our handling of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other petroleum products, because of air emissions and product-related discharges arising out of our operations,\n48\nand as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. For example, an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury, natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations.\nMoreover, stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our operational or compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. For example, in October 2021 the EPA announced plans to reconsider the Trump Administration’s December 2020 decision to retain the 2015 ground ozone standard, rather than making it more stringent, a decision on which is not expected until 2023. Also, there continues to be uncertainty on the federal government’s applicable jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands, as the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) under the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations have pursued multiple rulemakings since 2015 in an attempt to determine the scope of such reach. Most recently, in December 2022, the EPA and Corps released a final revised definition of “waters of the United States” founded upon the pre-2015 regulations and including updates to incorporate existing Supreme Court decisions and recognizing regional and geographic differences. However, the new rule has already been challenged, with the State of Texas and industry groups filing separate suits in federal court in Texas on January 18, 2023. Moreover, the EPA and the Corps have announced an intent to develop a subsequent rule further revising the definition. Judicial developments further add to this uncertainty. In October 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Sackett v. EPA which involves issues relating to the legal tests used to determine whether wetlands are “waters of the United States.” The Supreme Court is expected to release an opinion in this case in 2023, which could impact the regulatory definition and its implementation. The implementation of the final rule and the resultant expansion of the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, could lead to delays, restrictions or cessation of the development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our and our oil and natural gas customers’ operations, which may reduce the rate of production of natural gas or crude oil from operators with whom we have a business relationship and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nSeparately, Nationwide Permit (“NWP”) 12, which is available under the Clean Water Act for certain oil and gas activities, has been subject to legal challenges and regulatory revision in recent years. Following legal challenges to NWP 12 in the federal district court for the District of Montana, the Corps reissued NWP 12 for oil and natural gas pipeline activities, including certain revisions to the conditions for the use of NWP 12; however, an October 2021 decision by the District Court for the Northern District of California resulted in a vacatur of a 2020 rule revising the Clean Water Act Section 401 certification process. The U.S. Supreme Court has since stayed this vacatur and the EPA has proposed a rule to update and replace the relevant regulations, public comment on which closed in August 2022. While the Corps has resumed permitting decisions for such NWPs, the Corps has advised that, as part of the permitting decision process, the Corps will coordinate with certifying authorities on Section 401 certifications as needed, which may result in permit delays or otherwise impact our operations or those of our customers. Additionally, in March 2022, the Corps announced that it was seeking stakeholder input on a formal review of NWP 12. While the full extent and impact of these actions is unclear at this time, any disruption in our ability to obtain coverage under NWP 12 or other general permits may result in increased costs and project delays if we are forced to seek individual permits from the Corps. This in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state, tribal or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may (i) cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase or (ii) delay or increase the cost of expansion projects.\nWith the exception of the Driver Residue Pipeline, TPL SouthTex Transmission Company LP, Targa Midland Gas Pipeline LLC, Midland-Permian Pipeline LLC, Targa SouthTex Mustang Transmission Ltd., and Targa SouthTex Transmission LP, which are each subject to FERC regulation under the NGPA or limited FERC regulation under the NGA, our natural gas pipeline operations are generally exempt from FERC regulation, but FERC regulation still affects our non-FERC jurisdictional businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses, including certain FERC reporting and posting requirements in a given year. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial, ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. We also operate natural gas pipelines that extend from some of our processing plants to interconnections with both intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. Those facilities, known in the industry as “plant tailgate” pipelines, typically operate at transmission pressure levels and may transport “pipeline quality” natural gas. Because our plant tailgate pipelines are relatively short, we treat them as “stub” lines, which are exempt from FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act.\n49\nTarga NGL, Targa Gulf Coast, and Grand Prix Joint Venture have pipelines that are considered common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA. The ICA requires that we maintain tariffs on file with FERC for each of the Targa NGL, Targa Gulf Coast and Grand Prix Joint Venture common carrier pipelines that have not been granted a waiver. Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and non-discriminatory. With respect to pipelines that have been granted a waiver of the ICA and related regulations by FERC, should a particular pipeline’s circumstances change, FERC could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that such pipeline no longer qualifies for a waiver. In the event that FERC were to determine that one or more of these pipelines no longer qualified for a waiver, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC for the applicable pipeline(s), provide a cost justification for the transportation charge, and provide regulated services to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. Such a change in the jurisdictional status of transportation on these pipelines could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe classification of some of our gathering facilities, transportation pipelines, and purchase and sale transactions as FERC-jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress, in which case, our operating costs could increase and we could be subject to enforcement actions under the EP Act of 2005.\nVarious federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the BLM, Office of Natural Resources Revenue (formerly the Minerals Management Service) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with the Three Affiliated Tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, on which we operate a significant portion of our Badlands gathering and processing assets. The Three Affiliated Tribes is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees and other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations on Native American tribal lands. Lessees and operators conducting operations on tribal lands can generally be subject to the Native American tribal court system. One or more of these factors may increase our costs of doing business on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and may have an adverse impact on our ability to effectively transport products within the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation or to conduct our operations on such lands.\nOther FERC regulations may indirectly impact our businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas and liquids regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on open access transportation, gas quality, ratemaking, capacity release and market center promotion, may indirectly affect the natural gas and liquids markets. In recent years, FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas and liquids pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that FERC will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to transportation capacity. For more information regarding the regulation of our operations, see “Item 1. Business—Regulation of Operations.”\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more rigorous enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation.\nLegislation in the past decade has resulted in more stringent mandates for pipeline safety and has charged PHMSA with developing and adopting regulations that impose increased pipeline safety requirements on pipeline operators. In particular, the NGPSA and HLPSA were amended in recent years by the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act and, most recently, the PIPES Act of 2020. Each of these laws imposed increased pipeline safety obligations on pipeline operators. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act directed the promulgation of expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve, and excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, material strength pipeline testing and verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain intrastate gas transmission pipelines, whereas the 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowered PHMSA to address unsafe conditions or practices constituting imminent hazards by imposing emergency measures on pipeline facility owners and operators without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. The PIPES Act of 2020 reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2023 and directed the agency to move forward with several regulatory initiatives, including obligating operators of non-rural gas gathering lines and new and existing transmission and distribution pipeline facilities to conduct certain leak detection and repair programs and to require facility inspection and maintenance plans to align with those regulations. In furtherance of the PIPES Act of 2020, PHMSA issued final rules in November 2021 and August 2022, respectively, imposing a number of additional requirements. For further details, please see the risk factor entitled\n“We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity testing programs and related repairs.”\nThe imposition of new or enhanced safety requirements, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance by PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto, may require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in increased operating costs that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n50\nShould we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.\nUnder the EP Act of 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and NGPA to impose penalties for violations of the NGA or NGPA up to a maximum amount that is adjusted annually for inflation, which for 2023 equals approximately $1.5 million per violation per day, as well as authority to order disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our systems other than the Driver Residue Pipeline, TPL SouthTex Transmission Company LP, TPL SouthTex Pipeline Company LLC, Targa Midland Gas Pipeline LLC, Midland-Permian Pipeline LLC, Targa SouthTex Mustang Transmission Ltd., and Targa SouthTex Transmission LP, have not been regulated by FERC under the NGA or NGPA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements. In addition, FERC has civil penalty authority under the ICA to impose penalties for violations under the ICA up to a maximum amount that is adjusted annually for inflation, which for 2023 was up to approximately $15,662 per violation per day, and failure to comply with the ICA and regulations implementing the ICA could subject us to civil penalty liability. For more information regarding regulation of our operations, see “Item 1. Business—Regulation of Operations.” Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time.\nWe are or may become subject to cybersecurity and data privacy laws, regulations, litigation and directives relating to our processing of personal information.\nThe jurisdictions in which we operate (including the United States) may have laws governing how we must respond to a cyber incident that results in the unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss of personal information. Additionally, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including recent California legislation (which, among other things, provides for a private right of action), pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and could potentially elevate our costs over time. Although our business does not involve large-scale processing of personal information, our business does involve collection, use, and other processing of personal information of our employees, investors, contractors, suppliers, and customer contacts. As legislation continues to develop and cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures to comply with such legislation and to detect, investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cyber incidents. Any failure by us, or a company we acquire, to comply with such laws and regulations could result in reputational harm, loss of goodwill, penalties, liabilities, and/or mandated changes in our business practices.\n51"

    "text": "On December 26, 2018, Vitol Americas Corp. (“Vitol”) filed a lawsuit in the 80\nth\nDistrict Court of Harris County (the “District Court”), Texas against Targa Channelview LLC, then a subsidiary of the Company (“Targa Channelview”), seeking recovery of $129.0 million in payments made to Targa Channelview, additional monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. Vitol alleges that Targa Channelview breached an agreement, dated December 27, 2015, for crude oil and condensate between Targa Channelview and Noble Americas Corp. (the “Splitter Agreement”), which provided for Targa Channelview to construct a crude oil and condensate splitter (the “Splitter”) adjacent to a barge dock owned by Targa Channelview to provide services contemplated by the Splitter Agreement. In January 2018, Vitol acquired Noble Americas Corp. and on December 23, 2018, Vitol voluntarily elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement claiming that Targa Channelview failed to timely achieve start-up of the Splitter. Vitol’s lawsuit also alleges Targa Channelview made a series of misrepresentations about the capability of the barge dock that would service crude oil and condensate volumes to be processed by the Splitter and Splitter products. Vitol seeks return of $129.0 million in payments made to Targa Channelview prior to the start-up of the Splitter, as well as additional damages. On the same date that Vitol filed its lawsuit, Targa Channelview filed a lawsuit against Vitol seeking a judicial determination that Vitol’s sole and exclusive remedy was Vitol’s voluntarily termination of the Splitter Agreement and, as a result, Vitol was not entitled to the return of any prior payments under the Splitter Agreement or other damages as alleged. Targa also seeks recovery of its attorneys’ fees and costs in the lawsuit.\nOn October 15, 2020, the District Court awarded Vitol $129.0 million (plus interest) following a bench trial. In addition, the District Court awarded Vitol $10.5 million in damages for losses and demurrage on crude oil that Vitol purchased for start-up efforts. The Company appealed the award in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas.\nIn October 2020, we sold Targa Channelview, but under the agreements governing the sale, we retained the liabilities associated with the Vitol proceedings. On September 13, 2022, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals upheld the trial court’s judgment in part with regard to the return of Vitol’s prior payments, but modified the judgment to delete Vitol’s ability to recover any damages related to losses or demurrage on crude oil. We have filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of Texas, and the appeal remains pending. The cumulative amount of interest on the award through December 31, 2022, if accrued, would have been approximately $42.6 million.\nAdditional information required for this item is provided in Note 18 – Contingencies, under the heading “Legal Proceedings” included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference into this item."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes included in Part IV of this Annual Report. Additional sections in this Annual Report should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis, including the following: (i) a description of our business strategy found in “Item 1. Business–Overview”; (ii) a description of recent developments, found in “Item 1. Business–Recent Developments”; and (iii) a description of risk factors affecting us and our business, found in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nGeneral Trends and Outlook\nWe expect our results of operations to continue to be affected by the following key trends: commodity prices, volume throughput and demand for our products and services, contract terms and mix, the impact of our hedging activities, the cost to operate and support assets, volatile capital markets, competition and increased regulation. These expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.\nCommodity Prices\nThere has been, and we believe there will continue to be, volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices. The volatility and uncertainty of natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices impact drilling, completion and other investment decisions by producers and ultimately supply to our systems. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our cash flow is affected by supply and demand for natural gas, NGL products, and crude oil, and by natural gas, NGL, crude oil and condensate prices, and decreases in supply, demand or these prices could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.”\nOur operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas, NGL and condensate prices. Our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and the supply of and market demand for natural gas, NGLs and condensate, both of which are beyond our control. In a declining commodity price environment, without taking into account our hedges, we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent-of-proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines. The significant level of margin we derive from fee-based arrangements across our operations and particularly in our Downstream Business combined with our hedging arrangements helps to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements. For additional information regarding our hedging activities, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk — Commodity Price Risk.”\nThe following table presents selected average annual and quarterly industry index prices for natural gas, selected NGL products and crude oil for the periods presented:\n(1)\nNatural gas prices are based on average first of month prices from Henry Hub Inside FERC commercial index prices.\n(2)\n“Illustrative Targa NGL” pricing is weighted using average quarterly prices from Mont Belvieu Non-TET monthly commercial index and represents the following composition for the periods noted:\n2022: 43% ethane, 32% propane, 12% normal butane, 4% isobutane and 9% natural gasoline\n2021: 45% ethane, 31% propane, 11% normal butane, 4% isobutane and 9% natural gasoline\n(3)\nCrude oil prices are based on average quarterly prices of West Texas Intermediate crude oil as measured on the NYMEX.\n55\nVolumes and Demand for our Services\nFluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development and production of new oil and natural gas reserves. Our operations are affected by the level of crude, natural gas and NGL prices, the relationship among these prices and related activity levels from our customers. In our gathering and processing operations, plant inlet volumes, crude oil volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production and our competitive and contractual position on a regional basis and more broadly by the impact of prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs on exploration and production activity in the areas of our operations. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as crude oil and natural gas prices decrease below commercially acceptable levels. Producers generally focus their drilling activity on certain basins depending on commodity price fundamentals. Our asset systems are predominantly located in some of the most economic basins in the United States.\nThe factors that impact the gathering and processing volumes also impact the total volumes that flow to our Downstream Business. Accordingly, increased producer activity will drive demand for our midstream services and may result in incremental growth capital expenditures. Demand for our transportation, fractionation and other fee-based services is largely correlated with producer activity levels. Demand for our international export, storage and terminaling services has remained relatively constant, as demand for these services is based on a number of domestic and international factors.\nContract Terms, Contract Mix and the Impact of Commodity Prices\nAcross our operations and particularly in our Downstream Business, we benefit from long-term fee-based arrangements for our services. Our Gathering and Processing segment contract mix also has components of fee-based margin, such as fee floors and other fee-based services which mitigate against low commodity prices. The significant level of margin we derive from fee-based arrangements combined with our hedging arrangements helps to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements. Volatility in commodity prices can have a significant impact on our profitability, especially those percent-of-proceeds contracts that create direct exposure to changes in energy prices by paying us for gathering and processing services with a portion of proceeds from the commodities handled (“equity volumes”).\nContract terms in the Gathering and Processing segment are based upon a variety of factors, including natural gas and crude quality, geographic location, competitive dynamics and the pricing environment at the time the contract is executed, and customer requirements. Our gathering and processing contract mix and, accordingly, our exposure to crude, natural gas and NGL prices may change as a result of producer preferences, competition and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added, our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common and other market factors.\nThe contract terms and contract mix of our Downstream Business can also have a significant impact on our results of operations. Transportation and fractionation services are supported by fee-based contracts whose rates and terms are driven by NGL supply and transportation and fractionation capacity. Export services are supported by fee-based contracts whose rates and terms are driven by global LPG supply and demand fundamentals. The Logistics and Transportation segment includes predominantly fee-based contracts.\nImpact of Our Commodity Price Hedging Activities\nWe have hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. These transactions include swaps, futures, and purchased puts (or floors) and calls (or caps) to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk. We intend to continue managing our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into derivative transactions. We actively manage the Downstream Business product inventory and other working capital levels to reduce exposure to changing prices. For additional information regarding our hedging activities, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk–Commodity Price Risk.”\nOperating Expenses\nVariable costs such as service and repairs can impact our results. Continued expansion of existing assets will also give rise to additional operating expenses, which will affect our results. The employees supporting our operations are employees of Targa Resources LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours.\n56\nVolatile Capital Markets and Competition\nWe continuously consider and enter into discussions regarding potential growth projects and acquisitions and may contemplate external funding for potential growth projects and acquisitions. Any limitations on our access to capital may impair our ability to execute this strategy. If the cost of such capital becomes too expensive, our ability to develop or acquire strategic and accretive assets may be limited. We may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. The primary factors influencing our cost of borrowing include interest rates, credit spreads, covenants, underwriting or loan origination fees and similar charges we pay to lenders. These factors may impair our ability to execute our growth and acquisition strategy.\nCurrent economic conditions and competition for asset purchases and development opportunities could limit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy. Due to increased volatility in commodity prices and the broader market, the ability of companies in the oil and gas industry to seek financing and access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all has been negatively impacted. We believe we have sufficient access to financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet our requirements for working capital, debt service payments and capital expenditures in 2023 and beyond. For additional information regarding our financing activities, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nIncreased Regulation\nAdditional regulation in various areas has the potential to materially impact our operations and financial condition. For example, increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing used by producers and increased GHG emission regulations may cause reductions in supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from producers. Please read\n“Laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets”\n,\n“Our and our customers’ operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change (including legislation or regulation to address climate change) that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide,” and “Increasing stakeholder and market attention to ESG matters may impact our business”\nunder Item 1A. of this Annual Report. Similarly, the forthcoming rules and regulations of the CFTC may limit our ability or increase the cost to use derivatives, which could create more volatility and less predictability in our results of operations.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nThe profitability of our business is a function of the difference between: (i) the revenues we receive from our operations, including fee-based revenues from services and revenues from the natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate we sell, and (ii) the costs associated with conducting our operations, including the costs of wellhead natural gas, crude oil and mixed NGLs that we purchase as well as operating, general and administrative costs and the impact of our commodity hedging activities. Because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs, increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability. Our contract portfolio, the prevailing pricing environment for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, the impact of our commodity hedging program and its ability to mitigate exposure to commodity price movements and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGL throughput on our systems are important factors in determining our profitability. Our profitability is also affected by the NGL content in gathered wellhead natural gas, supply and demand for our products and services, utilization of our assets and changes in our customer mix.\nOur profitability is also impacted by fee-based contracts. Our growing capital expenditures for pipelines and gathering and processing assets underpinned by fee-based margin, expansion of our Downstream facilities, continued focus on adding fee-based margin to our existing and future gathering and processing contracts, as well as third-party acquisitions of businesses and assets, will continue to increase the number of our contracts that are fee-based. Fixed fees for services such as gathering and processing, transportation, fractionation, storage, terminaling and crude oil gathering are not directly tied to changes in market prices for commodities. Nevertheless, a change in market dynamics such as available commodity throughput does affect profitability.\nManagement uses a variety of financial measures and operational measurements to analyze our performance. These include: (1) throughput volumes, facility efficiencies and fuel consumption, (2) operating expenses, (3) capital expenditures and (4) the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment).\n57\nThroughput Volumes, Facility Efficiencies and Fuel Consumption\nOur profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply and crude oil supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from oil and natural gas wells that are connected to our gathering and processing systems. This is achieved by connecting new wells and adding new volumes in existing areas of production, as well as by capturing crude oil and natural gas supplies currently gathered by third parties. Similarly, our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of mixed NGL supply, connected by third-party transportation and Grand Prix, to our Downstream Business fractionation facilities and at times to our export facilities. We fractionate NGLs generated by our gathering and processing plants, as well as by contracting for mixed NGL supply from third-party facilities.\nIn addition, we seek to increase adjusted operating margin by limiting volume losses, reducing fuel consumption and by increasing efficiency. With our gathering systems’ extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities, we monitor the volumes received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems, the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of NGLs and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants. We also monitor the volumes of NGLs received, stored, fractionated and delivered across our logistics assets. This information is tracked through our processing plants and Downstream Business facilities to determine customer settlements for sales and volume related fees for service and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.\nAs part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations, we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss. We also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the NGLs and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plant to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of our facilities. Similar tracking is performed for our crude oil gathering and logistics assets and our NGL pipelines. These volume, recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis and safety programs.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are costs associated with the operation of specific assets. Labor, contract services, repair and maintenance and ad valorem taxes comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses. These expenses remain relatively stable and independent of the volumes through our systems, but may increase with system expansions and will fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures are classified as growth capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures. Growth capital expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets, extend asset useful lives, increase capacities from existing levels, add capabilities, and reduce costs or enhance revenues. Maintenance capital expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets, including the replacement of system components and equipment, which are worn, obsolete or completing their useful life and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nCapital spending associated with growth and maintenance projects is closely monitored. Return on investment is analyzed before a capital project is approved, spending is closely monitored throughout the development of the project, and the subsequent operational performance is compared to the assumptions used in the economic analysis performed for the capital investment approval.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe utilize non-GAAP measures to analyze our performance. Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (segment) are non-GAAP measures. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to these non-GAAP measures are income (loss) from operations, Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. and segment operating margin. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP measures and have important limitations as analytical tools. Investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because our non-GAAP measures exclude some, but not all, items that affect income and segment operating margin, and are defined differently by different companies within our industry, our definitions may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. Management compensates for the limitations of our non-GAAP measures as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into our decision-making processes.\n58\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nWe define adjusted operating margin for our segments as revenues less product purchases and fuel. It is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and commodity hedging program.\nGathering and Processing adjusted operating margin consists primarily of:\n•\nservice fees related to natural gas and crude oil gathering, treating and processing; and\n•\nrevenues from the sale of natural gas, condensate, crude oil and NGLs less producer settlements, fuel and transport and our equity volume hedge settlements.\nLogistics and Transportation adjusted operating margin consists primarily of:\n•\nservice fees (including the pass-through of energy costs included in certain fee rates);\n•\nsystem product gains and losses; and\n•\nNGL and natural gas sales, less NGL and natural gas purchases, fuel, third-party transportation costs and the net inventory change.\nThe adjusted operating margin impacts of mark-to-market hedge unrealized changes in fair value are reported in Other.\nAdjusted operating margin for our segments provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, including investors and commercial banks, to assess:\n•\nthe financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\n•\nour operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and\n•\nthe viability of capital expenditure projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.\nManagement reviews adjusted operating margin and operating margin for our segments monthly as a core internal management process. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operating results.\nThe reconciliation of our adjusted operating margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – By Reportable Segment.”\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss) attributable to Targa Resources Corp. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other items that we believe should be adjusted consistent with our core operating performance. The adjusting items are detailed in the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table and its footnotes. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks and others to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness and pay dividends to our investors.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nand Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nWe define distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense on debt obligations, cash tax (expense) benefit and maintenance capital expenditures (net of any reimbursements of project costs). We define adjusted free cash flow as distributable cash flow less growth capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interest and net contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Distributable cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are performance measures used by us and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess our ability to generate cash earnings (after servicing our debt and funding capital expenditures) to be used for corporate purposes, such as payment of dividends, retirement of debt or redemption of other financing arrangements.\n59\nOur Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following tables reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the periods indicated.\n(1)\nGains or losses on debt repurchases or early debt extinguishments.\n(2)\nIncludes financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, and other one-time transaction costs.\n(3)\nNoncontrolling interest portion of depreciation and amortization expense (including the effects of the impairment of long-lived assets on non-controlling interests).\n(4)\nExcludes amortization of interest expense.\n(5)\nRepresents capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests and includes net contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates.\n60\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table and discussion is a summary of our consolidated results of operations:\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and are discussed under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–How We Evaluate Our Operations.”\nNM        Due to a low denominator, the noted percentage change is disproportionately high and, as a result, is not considered meaningful.\n2022 Compared to 2021\nThe increase in commodity sales reflects higher natural gas, NGL and condensate prices ($3,116.3 million) and higher NGL, natural gas and condensate volumes ($615.9 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of hedges ($264.1 million).\nThe increase in fees from midstream services is primarily due to higher gas gathering and processing fees including the impact of the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin, and transportation and fractionation volumes, partially offset by lower export fees.\nThe increase in product purchases and fuel reflects higher natural gas, NGL and condensate prices and higher NGL, natural gas and condensate volumes.\nThe increase in operating expenses is primarily due to increased activity and system expansions, the acquisition of certain assets in South Texas and the Delaware Basin, and inflation, partially offset by the impact of a major winter storm that affected regions across Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Louisiana during the first quarter of 2021.\nSee “—Results of Operations—By Reportable Segment” for additional information on a segment basis.\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin and South Texas, the shortening of depreciable lives of certain assets that have been, or will be, idled and the impact of system expansions on our asset base, partially offset by a lower depreciable base associated with assets that were impaired during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, insurance costs and professional fees.\n61\nIn 2021, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax impairment loss of $452.3 million on assets in the South Texas region associated with our Central operations. See Note 5 - Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets for further discussion.\nOther operating (income) expense in 2021 consisted primarily of the write-down of certain assets to their recoverable amounts.\nThe increase in interest expense, net is primarily due to higher net borrowings, partially offset by the change in fair value of the mandatorily redeemable preferred interests, higher capitalized interest resulting from higher growth capital investments, and lower commitment fees.\nThe increase in equity earnings is primarily due to lower losses resulting from the purchase of our remaining interests in the two joint ventures in South Texas that we previously held as investments in unconsolidated affiliates and lower losses from GCF, partially offset by lower earnings resulting from the impact of the GCX Sale and lower earnings from our investment in Little Missouri 4 LLC. See Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates for further discussion.\nDuring 2022, the Partnership redeemed the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027 and the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2026. In addition, we terminated the Previous TRGP Revolver and the Partnership Revolver. These transactions resulted in a net loss from financing activities. During 2021, the Partnership redeemed the 5.125% Senior Notes due 2025 and the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2023 and Targa Pipeline Partners LP redeemed its TPL 4.750% Senior Notes due 2021 and TPL 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023, resulting in a net loss from financing activities.\nDuring 2022, we completed the GCX Sale resulting in a gain from sale of an equity method investment. See Note 4 - Acquisitions and Divestitures for further discussion.\nThe increase in income tax expense is primarily due to an increase in pre-tax book income, partially offset by a larger release of the valuation allowance in 2022 compared to 2021, the impact of statutory rate changes in Oklahoma and Louisiana in 2021 and the correction of a state tax error in 2021.\nThe decrease in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the DevCo JV Repurchase, partially offset by impairment losses in 2021 allocated to noncontrolling interest holders in the Carnero Joint Venture, higher income allocation to noncontrolling interests holders in the Grand Prix Joint Venture and Centrahoma Processing, LLC., and an increase in noncontrolling interest for a joint venture partner in WestTX.\nThe decrease in dividends on Series A Preferred is due to the full redemption of all of our issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred during 2022. See Note 11 – Preferred Stock for further discussion.\nResults of Operations—By Reportable Segment\nOur operating margins by reportable segment are:\n62\nGathering and Processing Segment\n(1)\nSegment operating statistics include the effect of intersegment amounts, which have been eliminated from the consolidated presentation. For all volume statistics presented, the numerator is the total volume sold during the period and the denominator is the number of calendar days during the period.\n(2)\nPlant natural gas inlet represents our undivided interest in the volume of natural gas passing through the meter located at the inlet of a natural gas processing plant, other than Badlands.\n(3)\nPlant natural gas inlet volumes and gross NGL production volumes include producer take-in-kind volumes, while natural gas sales and NGL sales exclude producer take-in-kind volumes.\n(4)\nPermian Midland includes operations in WestTX, of which we own 72.8% undivided interest, and other plants that are owned 100% by us. Operating results for the WestTX undivided interest assets are presented on a pro-rata net basis in our reported financials.\n(5)\nIncludes operations from the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin for the period effective August 1, 2022.\n(6)\nOperations include facilities that are not wholly owned by us. SouthTX operating statistics include the impact of the South Texas Acquisition for the period effective April 21, 2022. For more information regarding our joint ventures and jointly owned facilities, see “Item 1. Business—Our Business Operations.”\n(7)\nBadlands natural gas inlet represents the total wellhead volume and includes the Targa volumes processed at the Little Missouri 4 plant.\n(8)\nAverage realized prices include the effect of realized commodity hedge gain/loss attributable to our equity volumes. The price is calculated using total commodity sales plus the hedge gain/loss as the numerator and total sales volume as the denominator.\n63\nThe following table presents the realized commodity hedge gain (loss) attributable to our equity volumes that are included in the adjusted operating margin of the Gathering and Processing segment:\n(1)\nThe price spread is the differential between the contracted derivative instrument pricing and the price of the corresponding settled commodity transaction.\n2022 Compared to 2021\nThe increase in adjusted operating margin was due to higher realized commodity prices, higher natural gas inlet volumes, and higher fees resulting in increased margin predominantly in the Permian. The increase in natural gas inlet volumes in the Permian was attributable to the acquisition of certain assets in the Delaware Basin during the third quarter of 2022, higher producer activity and the addition of the Legacy and Red Hills VI plants during the third quarter of 2022. The decrease in volumes in the Coastal region was due to lower producer activity.\nThe increase in operating expenses was predominantly due to the acquisition of certain assets in South Texas and the Delaware Basin in the second and third quarters of 2022, which included one-time acquisition costs. Additionally, higher volumes in the Permian, the addition of the Legacy and Red Hills VI plants during the third quarter of 2022 and the Heim plant in the third quarter of 2021, and inflation impacts, resulted in increased costs.\nLogistics and Transportation Segment\n(1)\nSegment operating statistics include intersegment amounts, which have been eliminated from the consolidated presentation. For all volume statistics presented, the numerator is the total volume sold during the period and the denominator is the number of calendar days during the period.\n(2)\nRepresents the total quantity of mixed NGLs that earn a transportation margin.\n(3)\nExport volumes represent the quantity of NGL products delivered to third-party customers at our Galena Park Marine Terminal that are destined for international markets.\n2022 Compared to 2021\nThe increase in adjusted operating margin was due to higher pipeline transportation and fractionation margin and higher marketing margin, partially offset by lower LPG export margin. Pipeline transportation and fractionation volumes benefited from higher supply volumes primarily from our Permian Gathering and Processing systems and higher fees. Marketing margin increased due to greater optimization opportunities. LPG export margin decreased primarily due to higher fuel and power costs.\nThe increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance.\nOther\nOther contains the results of commodity derivative activity mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges. We have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of\n64\nour future commodity purchases and sales and natural gas transportation basis risk within our Logistics and Transportation segment. See further details of our risk management program in “Item 7A. – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022, inclusive of our consolidated joint venture accounts, we had $219.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a consolidated basis, our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows from operations, borrowings under the TRGP Revolver, Commercial Paper Program, Securitization Facility, and access to debt and equity capital markets. We supplement these sources of liquidity with joint venture arrangements and proceeds from asset sales. Our exposure to adverse credit conditions includes our credit facilities, cash investments, hedging abilities, customer performance risks and counterparty performance risks.\nWe believe our sources of liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months to satisfy our obligations. Our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These include commodity prices and ongoing efforts to manage operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. For additional discussion on recent factors impacting our liquidity and capital resources, see “Recent Developments.”\nOur liquidity and capital resources are managed on a consolidated basis. We have the ability to access the Partnership's liquidity as well as the ability to contribute capital to the Partnership. The actual amount we declare as dividends depends on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, the level of our capital expenditures, future business prospects, compliance with our debt covenants and any other matters that our board of directors deems relevant.\nShort-term Liquidity\nOur principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of internally generated cash flow, borrowings available under the TRGP Revolver, as well as our right to request additional commitment increases under the TRGP Revolver, the Securitization Facility, proceeds from debt and equity offerings, and joint ventures and/or asset sales. Based on anticipated levels of operations and absent any disruptive events, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to finance our operations, capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends and obligations, as discussed further below, for at least the next twelve months.\nOur short-term liquidity on a consolidated basis as of February 17, 2023, was:\n(1)\nIncludes cash held in our consolidated joint venture accounts.\nOther potential capital resources associated with our existing arrangements include our right to request an additional $500.0 million in commitment increases under the TRGP Revolver, subject to the terms therein. The TRGP Revolver matures on February 17, 2027.\nA portion of our capital resources are allocated to letters of credit to satisfy certain counterparty credit requirements. As of December 31, 2022, we had $33.2 million in letters of credit outstanding under the TRGP Revolver. The letters of credit also reflect certain counterparties’ views of our financial condition and ability to satisfy our performance obligations, as well as commodity prices and other factors.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities. On a consolidated basis, at the end of any given month, accounts receivable and payable tied to commodity sales and purchases are relatively balanced, with receivables from customers being offset by plant settlements payable to producers. The factors that typically cause overall variability in our reported total working capital are: (i) our cash position; (ii) liquids inventory levels, which we closely manage, and valuation; (iii) changes in payables and accruals related to major growth capital projects; (iv) changes in the fair value of the current portion of derivative contracts; (v) monthly swings\n65\nin borrowings under the Securitization Facility; and (vi) major structural changes in our asset base or business operations, such as certain organic growth capital projects and acquisitions or divestitures.\nWorking capital as of December 31, 2022 decreased $181.4 million compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to higher net borrowing on the Securitization Facility, and higher accounts payable and accruals related to growth projects in the Permian, partially offset by an increase to NGL inventory, higher net assets from hedging activities, and an increase in receivables resulting from higher commodity prices.\nLong-term Financing\nOur long-term financing consists of potentially raising funds through long-term debt obligations, the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, or joint venture arrangements. The majority of our debt is fixed rate borrowings; however, we have some exposure to the risk of changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of the variable rate borrowings under the TRGP Revolver, Term Loan Facility, the Securitization Facility, and the potential for variable rate borrowing under the Commercial Paper Program. We may enter into interest rate hedges with the intent to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any interest rate hedges.\nTo date, our debt balances and our subsidiaries’ debt balances have not adversely affected our operations, ability to grow or ability to repay or refinance indebtedness. For additional information about our debt-related transactions, see Note 8 - Debt Obligations to our consolidated financial statements. For information about our interest rate risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.”\nIn February 2022, we entered into the TRGP Revolver. The TRGP Revolver provides for a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount up to $2.75 billion, with an option to increase such maximum aggregate principal amount by up to $500.0 million in the future, subject to the terms of the TRGP Revolver, including a swing line sub-facility of up to $100.0 million. The TRGP Revolver matures in February 2027. In connection with our entry into the TRGP Revolver, we terminated the Previous TRGP Revolver and the Partnership Revolver. In February 2022, TRGP and the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from S&P and Fitch, and in March 2022, the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from Moody’s. As a result, in accordance with the TRGP Revolver, the collateral under the TRGP Revolver was released from the liens securing our obligations thereunder. As a result of the termination of the Previous TRGP Revolver and the Partnership Revolver, we recorded a loss of $0.8 million due to a write-off of debt issuance costs.\nIn February 2022, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a parent guarantee whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of all of the obligations of the Partnership and Targa Resources Partners Finance Corporation (together with the Partnership, the “Partnership Issuers”) under the respective indentures governing the Partnership Issuers’ senior unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2022, $5.0 billion of the Partnership Issuers’ senior unsecured notes was outstanding.\nIn March 2022, the Partnership redeemed all of the 5.375% Notes with available liquidity under the TRGP Revolver. As a result of the redemption of the 5.375% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $15.0 million comprised of $12.6 million of premiums paid and a write-off of $2.4 million of debt issuance costs.\nIn April 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of the 4.200% Notes and the 4.950% Notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to fund the concurrent March Tender Offer and the subsequent redemption of the Partnership’s 5.875% Notes, with the remainder of the net proceeds used for repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the TRGP Revolver. As a result of the March Tender Offer and the subsequent redemption of the 5.875% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $33.8 million comprised of $29.3 million of premiums paid and a write-off of $4.5 million of debt issuance costs.\nIn April 2022, the Partnership amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, extend the facility termination date to April 19, 2023 and replace the LIBOR-based interest rate option with SOFR-based interest rate options, including term SOFR and daily simple SOFR. In September 2022, the Partnership amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, increase the facility size from $400.0 million to $800.0 million and extend the facility termination date to September 1, 2023.\nIn May 2022, we redeemed all of our issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred at a redemption price of $1,050.00 per share, plus $8.87 per share, which is the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends from April 1, 2022 up to, but not including, the redemption date of May 3, 2022. Following the redemption, we have no Series A Preferred outstanding and all rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred were terminated. See Note 11 - Preferred Stock in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 in this Form 10-K.\n66\nIn July 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of the 5.200% Notes and the 6.250% Notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. We used the net proceeds from the issuance to fund a portion of the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nIn July 2022, we entered into the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for a three-year, $1.5 billion unsecured term loan facility and matures in July 2025. We used the proceeds to fund a portion of the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nIn July 2022, we established the Commercial Paper Program. Under the terms of the Commercial Paper Program, we may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities of less than one year. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with the maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $2.75 billion. We maintain a minimum available borrowing capacity under the TRGP Revolver equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as support. The Commercial Paper Program is guaranteed by each subsidiary that guarantees the TRGP Revolver. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.0 billion outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.\nIn January 2023, we completed the underwritten public offering of the 6.125% Notes and the 6.500% Notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance to fund the Grand Prix Transaction and the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to reduce borrowings under the TRGP Revolver and the Commercial Paper Program.\nIn the future, we or the Partnership may redeem, purchase or exchange certain of our and/or the Partnership’s outstanding debt through redemption calls, cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such calls, repurchases, exchanges or redemptions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nTo date, our debt balances and our subsidiaries’ debt balances have not adversely affected our operations, ability to grow or ability to repay or refinance indebtedness.\nCompliance with Debt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2022, both we and the Partnership were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements.\nCash Flow Analysis\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe primary drivers of cash flows from operating activities are (i) the collection of cash from customers from the sale of NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees for processing, gathering, export, fractionation, terminaling, storage and transportation, (ii) the payment of amounts related to the purchase of NGLs, natural gas and crude oil (iii) changes in payables and accruals related to major growth capital projects; and (iv) the payment of other expenses, primarily field operating costs, general and administrative expense and interest expense. In addition, we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk. Changes in the prices of the commodities we hedge impact our derivative settlements as well as our margin deposit requirements on unsettled futures contracts.\nThe increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to higher commodity prices, resulting in higher collections from customers, partially offset by an increase in payments for product purchases and fuel and hedge transactions.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the outlays for the Delaware Basin Acquisition and the South Texas Acquisition. Additionally, there were higher outlays for property, plant and equipment resulting from construction activities in the Permian, partially offset by proceeds from the GCX Sale. See “Recent Developments” for further details on our 2022 expansions.\n67\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was primarily due to net borrowings of debt in 2022, as compared to net repayments of debt in 2021, partially offset by the redemption of the Series A Preferred and repurchases of non-controlling interests in the DevCo JVs and common stock during 2022. Additionally, higher dividends were paid in 2022 due to the increase in our common stock dividends from $0.10 to $0.35 per common share in January 2022.\nSummarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nOur subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the TRGP Revolver (the “Obligated Group”) also fully and unconditionally guarantee, jointly and severally, the payment of TRGP’s and the Partnership Issuers’ senior notes, the payment of the notes under the Commercial Paper Program and our obligations under the Term Loan Facility, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nIn lieu of providing separate financial statements for the Obligated Group, we have presented the following supplemental summarized Combined Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations information for the Obligated Group based on Rule 13-01 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X.\nAll significant intercompany items among the Obligated Group have been eliminated in the supplemental summarized combined financial information. The Obligated Group’s investment balances in our non-guarantor subsidiaries have been excluded from the supplemental summarized combined financial information. Significant intercompany balances and activity for the Obligated Group with other related parties, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries (referred to as “affiliates”), are presented separately in the following supplemental summarized combined financial information.\nSummarized Combined Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations information for the Obligated Group follows:\n68\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe following table details the dividends declared and/or paid by us to common shareholders for 2022:\n(1)\nRepresents accrued dividends on restricted stock and restricted stock units that are payable upon vesting.\nPreferred Dividends\nSeries A Preferred Redemption\nIn May 2022, we redeemed in full all of our issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred at a redemption price of $1,050.00 per share, plus $8.87 per share, which is the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends from April 1, 2022 up to, but not including, the redemption date of May 3, 2022. The difference between the consideration paid of $973.4 million (including unpaid dividends of $8.2 million) and the net carrying value of the shares redeemed was $223.7 million, of which $215.5 million was recorded as deemed dividends in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the second quarter of 2022. Following the redemption, we have no Series A Preferred outstanding and all rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred were terminated. See Note 11 - Preferred Stock to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to the redemption of our Series A Preferred in May 2022, our Series A Preferred bore a cumulative 9.5% fixed dividend payable at the end of each fiscal quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $51.8 million of dividends to preferred shareholders.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table details cash outlays for capital projects for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(1)\nGrowth capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests and including net contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates, were $1,177.2 million and $407.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(2)\nMaintenance capital expenditures, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests, were $168.1 million and $131.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe increase in total growth capital expenditures was primarily due to system expansions in the Permian in response to forecasted production growth and higher activity levels, and expansions in our downstream business. The increase in total\nmaintenance\ncapital expenditures was primarily due to our growing infrastructure footprint.\nWith our announced natural gas processing additions currently under construction in the Permian region, coupled with the construction of our Daytona NGL Pipeline and Train 9 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, we currently estimate that in 2023 we will invest\nbetween $1.8 to $1.9\nbillion in net growth capital expenditures for announced projects. Future growth capital expenditures may vary based on\n69\ninvestment opportunities.\nWe expect that 2023 maintenance capital expenditures, net of noncontrolling interests, will be approximately $175 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were $243.2 million in surety bonds outstanding related to various performance obligations. These are in place to support various performance obligations as required by (i) statutes within the regulatory jurisdictions where we operate and (ii) counterparty support. Obligations under these surety bonds are not normally called, as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement.\nWe have invested in entities that are not consolidated in our financial statements. For information on our obligations with respect to these investments, as well as our obligations with respect to related letters of credit, see Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and Note 8 – Debt Obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations. The following is a summary of our material future contractual obligations:\n(1)\nRepresents scheduled future maturities of long-term debt obligation. See Note 8 - Debt Obligations for more information.\n(2)\nRepresents interest expense on long-term debt obligations based on both fixed debt interest rates and prevailing December 31, 2022 rates for floating debt. See Note 8 - Debt Obligations for more information.\n(3)\nIncludes minimum payments on operating lease obligations for office space and railcars. See Note 10 - Leases for more information.\n(4)\nIncludes minimum payments on finance lease obligations for compressors, substations, vehicles and tractors. See Note 10 - Leases for more information.\n(5)\nLand site lease and rights of way provide for surface and underground access for gathering, processing and distribution assets that are located on property not owned by us. These agreements expire at various dates with varying terms, some of which are perpetual. See Note 17 - Commitments for more information.\n(6)\nIncludes commitments for pipeline capacity payments for firm transportation and throughput and deficiency agreements, purchase of natural gas and NGLs, capital expenditures, operating expenses and service contracts. Contracts that will be settled at future spot prices are valued using prices as of December 31, 2022.\n(7)\nIncludes long-term liabilities of which we are certain of the amount and timing, including certain arrangements that resulted in deferred revenue and other liabilities pertaining to accrued dividends. See Note 9 - Other Long-term Liabilities for more information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain. See the description of our accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements for additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nFor business acquisitions, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Goodwill results when the cost of a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. Determining fair value requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to projections of future production volumes, pricing and cash flows, benchmark analysis of comparable public companies, discount rates, expectations regarding customer contracts and relationships, and other management estimates. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, the duration of each liability, and any resulting goodwill can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition. See Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nDepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment and Amortization of Intangible Assets\nDepreciation of our property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Our estimate of depreciation incorporates assumptions regarding the useful economic lives and residual values of our assets. The determination of useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions, including our expected use of the asset and the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served, normal wear and tear of facilities, and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs.\nWe amortize the costs of our intangible assets in a manner that closely resembles the expected benefit pattern of the intangible assets or on a straight-line basis, where such pattern is not readily determinable, over the periods in which we benefit from services provided to customers. At the time assets are placed in service or acquired, we believe such assumptions are reasonable; however, circumstances may develop that would cause us to change these assumptions, which would change our depreciation/amortization amounts prospectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate our carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including changes to our estimates that could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability. Asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. Individual assets are grouped at the lowest level for which the related identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. These cash flow estimates require us to make judgments and assumptions related to operating and cash flow results, economic obsolescence, the business climate, contractual, legal and other factors.\nIf the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge equal to the excess of net book value over fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable. The estimated cash flows used to assess recoverability of our long-lived assets and measure fair value of our asset groups are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price and volume projections reflective of the current environment and management's projections for long-term average prices and volumes. In addition to near and long-term price assumptions, other key assumptions include volume projections, operating costs, timing of incurring such costs and the use of an appropriate terminal value and discount rate. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our long-lived assets and the recognition of additional impairments.\nPrice Risk Management (Hedging)\nOur net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. In an effort to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, we have entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk.\nOne of the factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions used to value our derivative financial instruments, which are reflected at their fair values on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments using present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. Changes in the methods or assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of our derivative instruments could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that will affect us, see Note 3 – Significant Accounting Policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements."

    "text": "Our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices, particularly to the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, changes in interest rates, as well as nonperformance by our risk management counterparties and customers.\n71\nRisk Management\nWe evaluate counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit. All of our commodity derivatives are with major financial institutions or major energy companies. Should any of these financial counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We sell our natural gas, NGLs and condensate to a variety of purchasers. Non-performance by a trade creditor could result in losses.\nCrude oil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile. In an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows, we have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk through 2027. Market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future commodity derivative contracts.\nCommodity Price Risk\nA portion of our revenues are derived from percent-of-proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of commodities as payment for services. The prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. We monitor these risks and enter into hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business. Cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged.\nThe primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge some of the exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. In an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows, as of December 31, 2022, we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected (i) natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes in our Gathering and Processing operations that result from our percent-of-proceeds processing arrangements, (ii) future commodity purchases and sales in our Logistics and Transportation segment and (iii) natural gas transportation basis risk in our Logistics and Transportation segment. We hedge a higher percentage of our expected equity volumes in the current year compared to future years, for which we hedge incrementally lower percentages of expected equity volumes. We also enter into commodity financial instruments to help manage other short term commodity related business risks of our ongoing operations and in conjunction with marketing opportunities available to us in the operations of our logistics and transportation assets. With swaps, we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of commodities and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices. Since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity, these transactions are designed to effectively lock in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged. In order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes, we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected equity volumes. We utilize purchased puts (or floors) and calls (or caps) to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk. We may buy calls in connection with swap positions to create a price floor with upside. We intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into derivative transactions using swaps, collars, purchased puts (or floors), futures or other derivative instruments as market conditions permit.\nWhen entering into new hedges, we intend to generally match the NGL product composition and the NGL and natural gas delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes. The NGL hedges cover specific NGL products based upon the expected equity NGL composition. We believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as “proxy” hedges of NGL prices. The fair values of our natural gas and NGL hedges are based on published index prices for delivery at various locations, which closely approximate the actual natural gas and NGL delivery points. A portion of our condensate sales are hedged using crude oil hedges that are based on the NYMEX futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude.\nA majority of these commodity price hedges are documented pursuant to a standard International Swap Dealers Association form with customized credit and legal terms. The principal counterparties (or, if applicable, their guarantors) have investment grade credit ratings. While we have no current obligation to post cash, letters of credit or other additional collateral to secure these hedges so long as we maintain our current credit rating, we could be obligated to post collateral to secure the hedges in the event of an adverse change in our creditworthiness where a counterparty’s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices. A purchased put (or floor) transaction does not expose our counterparties to credit risk, as we have no obligation to make future payments beyond the premium paid to enter into the transaction; however, we are exposed to the risk of default by the counterparty, which is the risk that the counterparty will not honor its obligation under the put transaction.\nWe also enter into commodity price hedging transactions using futures contracts on futures exchanges. Exchange traded futures are subject to exchange margin requirements, so we may have to increase our cash deposit due to a rise in natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices. Unlike bilateral hedges, we are not subject to counterparty credit risks when using futures on futures exchanges.\n72\nThese contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances. Generally, our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set. If prices rise above the prices at which they have been hedged, we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges (other than with respect to purchased calls).\nTo analyze the risk associated with our derivative instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the change in fair value of our derivative instruments based on a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity prices, but does not reflect the impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on the related hedged items. The financial statement impact on the fair value of a derivative instrument resulting from a change in commodity price would normally be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged item under hedge accounting. The fair values of our derivative instruments are also influenced by changes in market volatility for option contracts and the discount rates used to determine the present values.\nThe following table shows the effect of hypothetical price movements on the estimated fair value of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022:\nThe table above contains all derivative instruments outstanding as of the stated date for the purpose of hedging commodity price risk, which we are exposed to due to our equity volumes and future commodity purchases and sales, as well as basis differentials related to our gas transportation arrangements.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operating revenues decreased by $(754.7) million and $(490.6) million as a result of transactions accounted for as derivatives. The estimated fair value of our risk management position has moved from a net liability position of $316.7 million at December 31, 2021 to $255.8 million at December 31, 2022. Forward commodity prices have increased relative to the fixed prices on our derivative contracts, creating the net liability position.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of variable rate borrowings under the TRGP Revolver, the Commercial Paper Program, the Securitization Facility, and the Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we do not have any interest rate hedges. However, we may enter into interest rate hedges in the future with the intent to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on cash flows. To the extent that interest rates increase, interest expense for the TRGP Revolver, the Commercial Paper Program, the Securitization Facility and the Term Loan Facility will also increase. As of December 31, 2022, we had $3.6 billion in outstanding variable rate borrowings. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in the rate of our variable interest rate debt would impact our consolidated annual interest expense by $36.0 million based on our December 31, 2022 debt balances.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nWe are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties. The credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of the asset position (i.e. the fair value of expected future receipts) at the reporting date. Our futures contracts have limited credit risk since they are cleared through an exchange and are margined daily. Should the creditworthiness of one or more of the counterparties decline, our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party. In the event of a counterparty default, we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted. We have master netting provisions in the International Swap Dealers Association agreements with our derivative counterparties. These netting provisions allow us to net settle asset and liability positions with the same counterparties within the same Targa entity, and would reduce our maximum loss due to counterparty credit risk by $19.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The range of losses attributable to our individual counterparties as of December 31, 2022 would be between $1.9 million and $16.4 million, depending on the counterparty in default.\n73\nCustomer Credit Risk\nWe extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business. We have established various procedures to manage our credit exposure, including performing initial and subsequent credit risk analyses, setting maximum credit limits and terms and requiring credit enhancements when necessary. We use credit enhancements including (but not limited to) letters of credit, prepayments, parental guarantees and rights of offset to limit credit risk to ensure that our established credit criteria are followed and financial loss is mitigated or minimized.\nWe have an active credit management process, which is focused on controlling loss exposure due to bankruptcies or other liquidity issues of counterparties. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.2 million and $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The change in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nNo customer comprised 10% or greater of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively."

AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nF-\n1\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL\nCONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nIn July 2022, we completed the Delaware Basin Acquisition. The Delaware Basin Acquisition constituted approximately 2% of total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and approximately 10% of total consolidated assets at December 31, 2022. Management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 excluded the Delaware Basin Acquisition. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC guidance that an assessment of recent business combinations may be omitted from management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition.\nManagement has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013 to evaluate the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F-3.\n/s/ Matthew J. Meloy\nMatthew J. Meloy\nChief Executive Officer\n(Principal Executive Officer)\n/s/ Jennifer R. Kneale\nJennifer R. Kneale\nChief Financial Officer\n(Principal Financial Officer)\nF-\n2\nReport of Independent Regist\nered Public Accounting Firm\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Targa Resources Corp.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Targa Resources Corp. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nand the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in owners’ equity and Series A preferred stock and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\n,\nand the results of its\noperations and its\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Lucid Energy Delaware, LLC (“Delaware Basin Acquisition”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Delaware Basin Acquisition from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Delaware Basin Acquisition is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 10% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nF-\n3\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nDelaware Basin Acquisition – Valuation of the Customer Relationships Intangible Asset\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the interests in Lucid Energy Delaware, LLC (“Lucid”) for approximately $3.5 billion in cash (the “Delaware Basin Acquisition”). The acquisition resulted in a $1,882.0 million customer relationships intangible asset being recorded.\nThe fair value of customer relationships was determined at the date of acquisition  based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the multi-period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used by management in determining the fair value of  customer relationships intangible assets include future revenues, discount rate, and customer attrition rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the customer relationships intangible asset acquired in the Delaware Basin Acquisition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships intangible asset; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to future revenues, discount rate, and customer attrition rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the acquired customer relationships intangible asset and controls over the development of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenues, discount rate, and customer attrition rates. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships intangible asset; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to future revenues, discount rate, and customer attrition rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to future revenues involved considering the past performance of the acquired business, consistency with economic and industry forecasts, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company’s multi-period excess earnings method and the reasonableness of discount rate and customer attrition rates significant assumptions.\nF-\n4\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 22, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nF-\n5\nPART I – FINANCI\nAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

(NYSE: TRGP) owns, operates, acquires, and develops a diversified portfolio of complementary domestic midstream infrastructure assets.\nIn this Annual Report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” “Targa” or \"TRGP\" are intended to mean our consolidated business and operations. TRGP controls the general partner of and owns all of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Targa Resources Partners LP, referred to herein as the “Partnership.” Targa consolidated the Partnership and its subsidiaries under GAAP, and prepared accompanying consolidated financial statements under the rules and regulations of the SEC. Targa’s consolidated financial statements include differences from the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership. The most noteworthy differences are:\n•\nthe inclusion of the TRGP senior revolving credit facility and term loan facility;\n•\nthe inclusion of the TRGP senior notes;\n•\nthe inclusion of the TRGP commercial paper notes;\n•\nthe inclusion of Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) prior to full redemption in May 2022; and\n•\nthe impacts of TRGP’s treatment as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOur Operations\nThe Company is primarily engaged in the business of:\n•\ngathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, and purchasing and selling natural gas;\n•\ntransporting, storing, fractionating, treating, and purchasing and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; and\n•\ngathering, storing, terminaling, and purchasing and selling crude oil.\nSee Note 24 – Segment Information for certain financial information regarding our business segments.\nNote 2 — Basis\nof Presentation\nThese accompanying financial statements and related notes present our consolidated financial position as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and changes in owners’ equity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n. We have prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nNote 3 — Significant\nAccounting Policies\nConsolidation Policy\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities that we control and our proportionate interest in the accounts of certain gas gathering and processing facilities in which we own an undivided interest and are responsible for our proportionate share of the costs and expenses of the facilities. Third party ownership interests in our controlled subsidiaries are presented as noncontrolling interests within the equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, except in the case of undivided interest ownership. In our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), noncontrolling interests reflect the attribution of results to third-party investors. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nF-\n12\nAs of December 31, 2022, our consolidated joint ventures include the following:\nGathering and Processing Segment\n•\n50\n% ownership interest in the Carnero G&P LLC;\n•\n60\n% ownership interest in Centrahoma Processing LLC;\n•\n55\n% ownership interest in Targa Badlands LLC;\n•\n72.8\n% undivided interest in the assets of Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent WestTex LLC; and\n•\n76.8\n% ownership interest in Venice Energy Services Company, LLC.\nLogistics and Transportation Segment\n•\n88\n% ownership interest in Cedar Bayou Fractionators, L.P.;\n•\n75\n% ownership interest in Grand Prix Pipeline LLC through the Grand Prix Joint Venture\n(prior to the Grand Prix Transaction, as defined in Note 4\n– Acquisitions and Divestitures); and\n•\n80\n% ownership interest in Targa Train 7 LLC.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to investments over which we exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of our investee, but do not exercise control. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment when evidence indicates the carrying amount of our investment is no longer recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the equity method investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. When the estimated fair value of an equity investment is less than its carrying value and the loss in value is determined to be other than temporary, we recognize the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value as a non-cash pre-tax impairment loss within Equity earnings (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates include the following:\nGathering and Processing Segment\n•\n50\n% ownership interest in Little Missouri 4 LLC (“Little Missouri 4”).\nLogistics and Transportation Segment\n•\n50\n% ownership interest in Cayenne Pipeline, LLC (“Cayenne”); and\n•\n38.8\n% ownership interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators (“GCF”).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Estimates and judgments are used in, among other things, (i) estimating unbilled revenues, product purchases and operating and general and administrative cost accruals, (ii) developing fair value assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, (iii) analyzing long-lived assets for possible impairment, (iv) estimating the useful lives of assets, (v) estimating contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications and (vi) estimating redemption value of mandatorily redeemable preferred interests.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash, and have original maturities of three months or less.\nF-\n13\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nEstimated losses on accounts receivable are provided through an allowance for doubtful accounts. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts through various procedures, including extensive review of our trade receivable balances by counterparty, assessing economic events and conditions, our historical experience with counterparties, the counterparty’s financial condition and the amount and age of past due accounts.\nWe continuously evaluate our ability to collect amounts owed to us. Receivables are considered past due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date. Our evaluation procedures also include performing account reconciliations, dispute resolution and payment confirmation.\nAs the financial condition of any counterparty changes, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to our allowance may be required.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist primarily of NGL product inventories, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the average cost method. Most NGL product inventories turn over monthly, but some inventory, primarily propane, is acquired and held during the year to meet anticipated heating season requirements of our customers. Commodity inventories that are not physically or contractually available for sale under normal operations (“deadstock”) are included in Property, plant and equipment.\nProduct Exchanges\nExchanges of NGL products are executed to satisfy timing and logistical needs of the exchange parties. Volumes received and delivered under exchange agreements are recorded as inventory. If the locations of receipt and delivery are in different markets, an exchange differential may be billed or owed. The exchange differential is recorded as either accounts receivable or accrued liabilities.\nGas Processing Imbalances\nQuantities of natural gas and/or NGLs over-delivered or under-delivered, related to certain gas plant operational balancing agreements, are recorded monthly as inventory or as a payable using the weighted average price at the time the imbalance was created. Inventory imbalances receivable are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the average cost method; inventory imbalances payable are valued at replacement cost. These imbalances are settled either by current cash-out settlements or by adjusting future receipts or deliveries of natural gas or NGLs.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe utilize derivative instruments to manage the volatility of our cash flows due to fluctuating energy commodity prices. For balance sheet classification purposes, we analyze the fair values of the derivative instruments on a contract by contract basis and report the related fair values and any related collateral by counterparty on a gross basis. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as hedges are recognized in the same financial statement line item as the cash flows from the respective item being hedged.\nWe formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge. This documentation includes the specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and the manner in which the hedging instrument’s effectiveness will be assessed. At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.\nWe record all derivative instruments at fair value with the exception of those that we apply the normal purchases and normal sales election.\nF-\n14\nThe table below summarizes the accounting treatment for our derivative instruments, and the impact on our consolidated financial statements:\nWe will discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis when a hedge instrument is terminated, ceases to be highly effective or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable to occur. Gains and losses deferred in AOCI related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The determination of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions, including our expected use of the asset and the supply of, and demand for, hydrocarbons in the markets served, normal wear and tear of the facilities, and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs. Upon disposition or retirement of property, plant and equipment, any gain or loss is recorded to operations.\nExpenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures to refurbish an asset that increases its existing service potential or prevents environmental contamination are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset or major asset component. Certain costs directly related to the construction of assets, including internal labor costs, interest and engineering costs, are capitalized.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate our carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including changes to our estimates that could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability. Asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. Individual assets are grouped at the lowest level for which the related identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. These cash flow estimates require us to make judgments and assumptions related to operating and cash flow results, economic obsolescence, the business climate, contractual, legal and other factors.\nIf the carrying amount exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flows, we recognize a non-cash pre-tax impairment loss equal to the excess of net book value over fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable. The estimated cash flows used to assess recoverability of our long-lived assets and measure fair value of our asset groups are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price and volume projections reflective of the current environment and management's projections for long-term average prices and volumes. In addition to near and long-term price assumptions, other key assumptions include volume projections, operating costs, timing of incurring such costs, and the use of an appropriate terminal value and discount rate. Any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our long-lived assets and the recognition of additional impairments. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is a residual intangible asset that results when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment at least annually. This test requires us to attribute goodwill to an appropriate reporting unit, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). We evaluate goodwill for impairment on November 30 of each year, or whenever impairment indicators are present. Prior to us conducting the goodwill impairment test, we complete a review of the carrying values of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. If it is determined that the carrying values are not recoverable, we reduce the carrying values of the long-lived assets pursuant to our policy on property, plant and equipment.\nF-\n15\nAs part of our goodwill impairment test, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If we choose to bypass this qualitative assessment or determine that a goodwill impairment test is required, our annual goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount (including attributed goodwill). We recognize an impairment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and a corresponding reduction of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The goodwill impairment loss will not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, when measuring goodwill, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit, if applicable.\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets include producer dedications under long-term contracts and customer relationships associated with business and asset acquisitions. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets was determined at the date of acquisition based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. We amortize the costs of our assets in a manner that closely resembles the expected benefit pattern of the intangible assets or on a straight-line basis, where such pattern is not readily determinable, over the periods in which we benefit from services provided to customers.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations (“AROs”) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation. We record a liability and increase the basis in the underlying asset for the present value of each expected ARO when there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law, statute, written or oral contract or by legal construction.\nOur obligations are estimated based on discounted cash flow (“DCF”) estimates. Over time, the ARO liability is accreted to its present value as a period cost and the capitalized amount is depreciated over the asset’s respective useful life. At least annually, we review the projected timing and amount of AROs and reflect revisions as an increase or decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the basis in the underlying asset. Upon settlement, we will recognize any difference between the recorded amount and the actual settlement cost as a gain or loss.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nCosts incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt and any original issue discount or premium are deferred and charged to interest expense over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs related to revolving credit facilities and commercial paper notes are presented as other long-term assets, and debt issuance costs related to long-term debt obligations with scheduled maturities are reflected as a deduction to the carrying amount of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains or losses on debt repurchases, redemptions and debt extinguishments include any associated unamortized debt issuance costs.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facility\nProceeds from the sale or contribution of certain receivables under the Partnership’s accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Securitization Facility”) are treated as collateralized borrowings in our financial statements. Proceeds and repayments under the Securitization Facility are reflected as cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEnvironmental Liabilities and Other Loss Contingencies\nWe accrue a liability for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources, when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\nIncome Taxes\nWe file many income tax returns with the United States Department of the Treasury, as well as numerous states. We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual current tax payable and related tax expense, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences can result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on a net basis by jurisdiction within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We report these timing differences based on statutory tax rates applicable to the scheduled timing difference reversal periods.\nF-\n16\nWe assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance if we believe that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Any change in the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made. We consider all available evidence to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, we need a valuation allowance. Evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as all currently available information about future years, including our anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies.\nDividends\nPreferred and common dividends declared are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings to the extent that retained earnings was available at the close of the prior quarter, with any excess recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.\nMandatorily Redeemable Preferred Interests\nMandatorily redeemable preferred interests, which represent our joint venture partners’ interests in two joint ventures, have been included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and such interests with multiple or indeterminate redemption dates were reported at their estimated redemption value as of the reporting dates. These point-in-time values did not represent the amount that ultimately would be redeemed in the future. Changes in the redemption value have been included in interest expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEffective September 1, 2022, we redeemed our joint venture partner's mandatorily redeemable preferred interests in the\ntwo\njoint ventures that, separately, owned a\n100\n% interest in the WestOK natural gas gathering and processing system and a\n72.8\n% undivided interest in the WestTX natural gas gathering and processing system.\nPrior to the redemption, the joint ventures collectively held $\n1.9\nbillion face value in notes receivable from our partner, which were due\nJuly 2042\n. The interest rate payable under the notes receivable was a variable LIBOR-based rate. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, interest income (expense) on the notes receivable was $(\n1.8\n) million, $\n12.3\nmillion and $\n8.6\nmillion, net of the return paid to our partner, which was reflected within Interest expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes net income and other comprehensive income (“OCI”), which includes changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges\n.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur operating revenues are primarily derived from the following activities:\n•\nsales of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil;\n•\nservices related to compressing, gathering, treating, and processing of natural gas; and\n•\nservices related to NGL fractionation, terminaling and storage, transportation and treating.\nWe have multiple types of contracts with commercial counterparties and many of these contracts contain embedded fees with settlement provisions that deduct these fees from the sales price paid by Targa in exchange for commodities. The commercial relationship of the counterparty in such contracts is inherently one of a supplier, rather than a customer, and therefore, such contracts are excluded from the provisions of the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. Any cash inflows or fees that are realized on these supply type contracts are reported as a reduction of Product purchases and fuel.\nOur revenues, therefore, are measured based on consideration specified in a contract with parties designated as customers. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a commodity or service to a customer. Sales and other taxes we collect, that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing activities, are excluded from revenues.\nWe generally report sales revenues on a gross basis in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as we typically act as the principal in the transactions where we receive and control commodities. However, buy-sell transactions that involve purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty, which are legally contingent or in contemplation of one another, as well as other instances where we do not control the commodities, but rather are acting as an agent to the supplier, are reported as a single revenue transaction on a combined net basis.\nF-\n17\nOur commodity sales contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, whereby each distinct unit of commodity to be transferred to the customer is a separate performance obligation. Under such contracts, revenue is recognized at the point in time each unit is transferred to the customer because the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the commodity at that time. In certain instances, it may be determinable that the customer receives and consumes the benefits of each unit as it is transferred. Under such contracts, we have a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct units of commodity; and in such instance, revenue is recognized over time using the units delivered output method, as each distinct unit is transferred to the customer. Our commodity sales contracts are typically priced at a market index, but may also be set at a fixed price. When our sales are priced at a market index, we apply the allocation exception for variable consideration and allocate the market price to each distinct unit when it is transferred to the customer. The fixed price in our commodity sales contracts generally represents the standalone selling price, and therefore, when each distinct unit is transferred to the customer, we recognize revenue at the fixed price.\nOur service contracts typically contain a single performance obligation. The underlying activities performed by us are considered inputs to an integrated service and not separable because such activities in combination are required to successfully transfer the single overall service that the customer has contracted for and expects to receive. Therefore, the underlying activities in such contracts are not considered to be distinct services. However, in certain instances, the customer may contract for additional distinct services and therefore additional performance obligations may exist. In such instances, the transaction price is allocated to the multiple performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The performance obligation(s) in our service contracts is a series of distinct days of the applicable service over the life of the contract (fundamentally a stand-ready service), whereby we recognize revenue over time using an output method of progress based on the passage of time (i.e., each day of service). This output method is appropriate because it directly relates to the value of service transferred to the customer to date, relative to the remaining days of service promised under the contract.\nThe transaction price for our service contracts is typically comprised of variable consideration, which is primarily dependent on the volume and composition of the commodities delivered and serviced. The variable consideration is generally commensurate with our efforts to perform the service and the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to our efforts to satisfy each day of distinct service. Therefore, the variable consideration is typically not estimated at contract inception, but rather the allocation exception for variable consideration is applied, whereby the variable consideration is allocated to each day of service and recognized as revenue when each day of service is provided. When we are entitled to noncash consideration in the form of commodities, the variability related to the form of consideration (market price) and reasons other than form (volume and composition) are interrelated to the service, and therefore, we measure the noncash consideration at the point in time when the volume, mix and market price related to the commodities retained in-kind are known. This results in the recognition of revenue based on the market price of the commodity when the service is performed. In addition, if the transaction price includes a fixed component (i.e., a fixed capacity reservation fee), the fixed component is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the contract term, as each day of service has elapsed, which is consistent with the output method of progress selected for the performance obligation.\nOur customers are typically billed on a monthly basis, or earlier, if final delivery and sale of commodities is made prior to month-end, and payment is typically due within\n10\nto\n30 days\n. As a practical matter, we define the unit of account for revenue recognition purposes based on the passage of time ranging from one month to one quarter, rather than each day. This is because the financial reporting outcome is the same regardless of whether each day or month/quarter is treated as the distinct service in the series. That is, at the end of each month or quarter, the variability associated with the amount of consideration for which we are entitled to, is resolved, and can be included in that month or quarter’s revenue.\nWe have certain long-term contractual arrangements under which we have received consideration, but for which all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. These arrangements result in deferred revenue, which will be recognized over the periods that performance will be provided.\nContract Assets\nWe classify our contract assets as receivables because we generally have an unconditional right to payment for the commodities sold or services performed at the end of the reporting period.\nF-\n18\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe award share-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. Compensation expense on our equity-classified awards is recorded at grant-date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized in general and administrative expense over the requisite service period of each award, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. We may purchase a portion of the shares issued to satisfy employees’ tax withholding obligations on vested awards. These shares are recorded in treasury stock, at cost, and cash paid is classified as a financing activity in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based compensation are recognized as income tax benefit or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, with the tax effects of exercised or vested awards treated as discrete items in the reporting period which they occur. Excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) is based on the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and vested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. Diluted EPS includes any dilutive effect of preferred stock, unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units. The dilutive effect is calculated through the application of (i) the if-converted method for convertible preferred stock, and (ii) the treasury stock method for unvested stock awards.\nLeases\nWe recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date:\n•\nA lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease.\n•\nA right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are considered short-term leases, which are excluded from the balance sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease prepayments and excludes lease incentives. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to compute the present value of our lease liability. The discount rate applied is determined based on information available on the date of adoption for all leases existing as of that date, and on the date of lease commencement for all subsequent leases.\nOur lease arrangements may include variable lease payments based on an index or market rate, or may be based on performance. For variable lease payments based on an index or market rate, we estimate and apply a rate based on information available at the commencement date. Variable lease payments based on performance are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, and are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations when the contingency underlying such variable lease payments is resolved. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Such options are included in the measurement of our right-of-use asset and liability, provided we determine that we are reasonably certain to exercise the option.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue Contract Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. Amendments in this update require application of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. These amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. However, an entity that elects to early adopt must apply the amendments to all business combinations that occurred during the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We early adopted the amendments on April 1, 2022 and have applied them to business combinations in 2022. We applied the amendments to the Delaware Basin Acquisition, as defined in Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures, by recognizing contract liabilities from contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606.\nF-\n19\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nSupplier Finance Programs\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50). Amendments in this update require annual and interim disclosure of the key terms of outstanding supplier finance programs and a rollforward of the related obligations. These amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation of the supplier finance program obligations. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the rollforward requirements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We have evaluated the effect of the amendments on our consolidated financial statements and will disclose the required information beginning in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\nNote 4 –\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nDevCo Joint Ventures\nIn February 2018, we formed\nthree\ndevelopment joint ventures (“DevCo JVs”) with investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners (“Stonepeak”) to fund portions of Grand Prix NGL Pipeline (“Grand Prix”), Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (“GCX”) and a\n110\nMBbl/d fractionator in Mont Belvieu, Texas (“Train 6”). For a four-year period beginning on the date that all three projects commenced commercial operations, we had the option to acquire all or part of Stonepeak’s interests in the DevCo JVs (the “DevCo JV Call Right”). The purchase price payable for such partial or full interests was based on a predetermined fixed return or multiple on invested capital, including distributions received by Stonepeak from the DevCo JVs.\nIn January 2022, we exercised the DevCo JV Call Right and closed on the purchase of all of Stonepeak’s interests in the DevCo JVs for $\n926.3\nmillion (the “DevCo JV Repurchase”). Following the DevCo JV Repurchase, we owned a\n75\n% interest in the Permian to Mont Belvieu segment of Grand Prix through Grand Prix Pipeline LLC (the “Grand Prix Joint Venture”) (prior to the Grand Prix Transaction, as defined below), a\n100\n% interest in Train 6 and a\n25\n% equity interest in GCX (prior to the GCX Sale as defined below in February 2022). The changes in our ownership interests were accounted for as equity transactions representing the acquisitions of noncontrolling interests. The amount of the redemption price in excess of the carrying amount, net of tax was $\n53.2\nmillion, which was accounted for as a premium on repurchase of noncontrolling interests, and resulted in a reduction to Net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders. In addition, the DevCo JV Repurchase resulted in an $\n857.9\nmillion reduction of Noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSubsequent Event\nOn January 9, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Blackstone Energy Partners’\n25\n% interest in Grand Prix Joint Venture (the “Grand Prix Transaction”) for aggregate consideration of $\n1.05\nbillion, subject to certain closing adjustments. Following the closing of the Grand Prix Transaction, we own\n100\n% of the interest in Grand Prix.\nSouth Texas Acquisition\nIn April 2022, we completed the acquisition of Southcross Energy Operating LLC and its subsidiaries (“Southcross”) for a purchase price of $\n201.9\nmillion (the “South Texas Acquisition”), subject to customary closing adjustments. We made a final net working capital adjustment payment of approximately $\n1.5\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2022. We acquired a portfolio of complementary midstream infrastructure assets and associated contracts that have been integrated into our SouthTX Gathering and Processing operations, including the remaining interests in the\ntwo\njoint ventures in South Texas that we previously held as investments in unconsolidated affiliates and that have been consolidated beginning in the second quarter of 2022. We accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition and have capitalized $\n1.8\nmillion of acquisition-related costs and assumed liabilities of $\n1.8\nmillion as components of the cost of assets acquired. We allocated $\n28.1\nmillion to our purchase of Southcross’ interest in the two joint ventures for purposes of consolidation and $\n169.7\nmillion, $\n3.9\nmillion and $\n5.3\nmillion of the residual cost to property, plant and equipment, current assets and liabilities, net and other non-current assets, respectively.\nDelaware Basin Acquisition\nIn July 2022, we completed the acquisition of all of the interests in Lucid Energy Delaware, LLC (“Lucid”) from Riverstone Holdings LLC and Goldman Sachs Asset Management for approximately $\n3.5\nbillion in cash (the “Delaware Basin Acquisition”), subject to customary closing adjustments. We received a final net working capital adjustment payment of approximately $\n11.4\nmillion\nin the fourth\nF-\n20\nquarter\nof 2022. We funded the acquisition with (i) $\n1.5\nbillion in proceeds drawn under our Term Loan Agreement with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (“Mizuho”) as the Administrative Agent and a lender, and other lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan Facility”), (ii) $\n750.0\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of our\n5.200\n% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “\n5.200\n% Notes”) and $\n500.0\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of our\n6.250\n% Senior Notes due 2052 (the “\n6.250\n% Notes”) pursuant to an underwritten public offering that closed in July 2022 and (iii) $\n800.0\nmillion drawn on our $\n2.75\nbillion TRGP revolving credit facility (the “TRGP Revolver”). We recorded $\n16.9\nmillion of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan Facility, the\n5.200\n% Notes and the\n6.250\n% Notes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 8 – Debt Obligations for further details on our financing activities.\nThe assets acquired in the Delaware Basin Acquisition provide natural gas gathering, treating, and processing services in the Delaware Basin, through owning and operating approximately\n1,050\nmiles of natural gas pipelines and approximately\n1.4\nbillion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”) of cryogenic natural gas processing capacity primarily in Eddy and Lea counties of New Mexico. The Delaware Basin Acquisition assets increase our footprint in the Delaware Basin and are integrated into our Permian Delaware operations.\nThe Delaware Basin Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n, which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities was prepared using fair value methods and assumptions, including projections of future production volumes, commodity prices, and other cash flows, market-participant assumptions (e.g., discount rate and exit multiple), expectations regarding customer contracts and relationships, tangible asset replacement costs, and other management estimates. The fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements. These inputs require judgments and estimates at the time of valuation.\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price allocation based on the final fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions):\n(1)\nThe fair value of the assets acquired includes trade receivables of $\n211.0\nmillion. The gross amount due under contract was $\n213.4\nmillion, of which $\n2.4\nmillion was expected to be uncollectible. Trade receivables, net of allowances, excludes $\n18.5\nmillion that was due from Targa. We reflected this settlement of a preexisting relationship as a reduction of the purchase price in accordance with ASC 805.\nThe value of property, plant and equipment is determined using the cost approach and is primarily comprised of Gathering and Processing assets that will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of\n20 years\n. The associated useful lives of property, plant and equipment were based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows.\nThe value of intangible assets is comprised of customer relationships, which represent estimated value of long-term contracts with customers, that will be amortized in a manner that closely resembles the expected benefit pattern of the intangible assets over an estimated useful life of\n14 years\n. The associated useful lives of intangible assets were based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. The fair value of customer relationships was determined at the date of acquisition based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the multi-period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used by management in determining the fair value of customer relationships intangible assets include future revenues, discount rate, and customer attrition rates.\nThe fair values of the tangible and intangible assets are Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the intangible assets was determined by applying a discounted cash flow approach, which utilized a discount rate of approximately\n19\n% based on our estimate of the risk that a theoretical market participant would assign to the respective intangible assets, and customer attrition rates of approximately\n5\n%.\nF-\n21\nThe results of operations attributable to the assets and liabilities acquired in the Delaware Basin Acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements as part of our Permian Delaware operations in the Gathering and Processing segment since the date of the acquisition. Revenue and Net Income attributable to the assets acquired for the period August 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 were $\n374.1\nmillion and $\n7.9\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022\n, we had incurred $\n14.4\nmillion of acquisition-related costs.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma summary presents the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 as if the Delaware Basin Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations that would have occurred had the transaction been consummated at the beginning of the period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.\nThe summarized unaudited pro forma information has been calculated after applying our accounting policies and reflects adjustments for the following:\n•\nReflects depreciation and amortization based on the fair values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, respectively. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated utilizing a straight-line approach. Intangible assets are amortized in a manner that closely resembles their expected benefit pattern;\n•\nExcludes $\n14.4\nmillion of acquisition-related costs incurred as of\nDecember 31, 2022 from pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was adjusted to include those costs;\n•\nExcludes the impact of operations previously sold by Lucid, prior to Targa’s acquisition of Lucid;\n•\nExcludes the impact of historical activity between Targa and Lucid, prior to Targa’s acquisition of Lucid;\n•\nExcludes general and administrative expense related to Lucid’s former parent company, which Targa did not acquire;\n•\nExcludes amortization of interest expense and debt issuance costs associated with Lucid’s debt, which was not assumed by Targa;\n•\nIncludes interest expense and debt issuance cost amortization associated with Targa’s borrowings to finance the Delaware Basin Acquisition; and\n•\nReflects the income tax effects of the above pro forma adjustments.\nDivestitures\nSale of Assets in Channelview, Texas\nIn October 2020, we closed on the sale of our assets in Channelview, Texas for approximately $\n58\nmillion. As a result of the sale, we recognized a loss of $\n58.3\nmillion included within Other operating (income) expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to reduce the carrying value of our assets to their recoverable amounts. The sale of the assets is included in our Logistics and Transportation segment and does not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation, as its divestiture did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations or financial results.\nSale of Targa GCX Pipeline LLC\nIn May 2022, we completed the sale of Targa GCX Pipeline LLC, which held a\n25\n% equity interest in GCX, to a third party for $\n857.0\nmillion (the “GCX Sale”). As a result of the GCX Sale, we recognized a gain of $\n435.9\nmillion in Gain (loss) from sale of equity method investment in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2022.\nSee Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates for further discussion on South Texas Acquisition and GCX Sale.\nF-\n22\nNote 5 — Property, Plant and E\nquipment and Intangible Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets\nDuring the preparation of the Company's 2020 consolidated financial statements, the Company identified certain gathering pipelines that should not have had value ascribed to them as part of a prior acquisition as these assets were inactive. The Company does not believe this error is material to its previously issued historical consolidated financial statements for any of the periods impacted and accordingly, has not adjusted the historical financial statements. The Company wrote these assets down in 2020 and recognized a non-cash loss of $\n32.4\nmillion in Other operating (income) expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 depreciation expense was $\n853.8\nmillion, $\n739.6\nmillion and $\n721.1\nmillion, respectively.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of customer relationships acquired in the Delaware Basin Acquisition, and customer contracts and customer relationships acquired in prior business combinations. The fair value of these acquired intangible assets were determined at the date of acquisition based on the present values of estimated future cash flows. Amortization expense attributable to these assets is recorded over the periods in which we benefit from services provided to customers.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n, amortization expense for our intangible assets was $\n242.2\nmillion, $\n131.0\nmillion and $\n144.0\nmillion, respectively. The estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $\n384.0\nmillion, $\n373.2\nmillion, $\n326.0\nmillion, $\n279.8\nmillion and $\n252.2\nmillion for each of the years 2023 through 2027. As of\nDecember 31, 2022\n, the weighted average amortization period for our intangible assets was approximately\n12.4\nyears.\nThe changes in our intangible assets are as follows:\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review and evaluate our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, including changes to our estimates that could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability.\nF-\n23\n2021\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $\n452.3\nmillion, comprised of $\n295.7\nmillion for the impairment of certain gas processing facilities and gathering systems, and $\n156.6\nmillion related to the impairment of intangible customer relationships associated with our Central operations in the Gathering and Processing segment. The impairment was a result of our assessment that forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from operations, while positive, will not be sufficient to recover the existing total net book value of the underlying assets. Underlying our assessment were lower expectations regarding volumes and rates associated with the renewal of future expiring contracts and negotiation of new contracts in the South Texas region.\n2020\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $\n2,442.8\nmillion, comprised of $\n2,234.2\nmillion related to the impairment of certain gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our Central operations and our Coastal operations in the Gathering and Processing segment, and $\n208.6\nmillion related to the impairment of intangible customer relationships associated with our Central operations in the Gathering and Processing segment. The impairment was a result of our assessment that forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from operations, while positive, will not be sufficient to recover the existing total net book value of the underlying assets. Underlying our assessment was an observed global commodity price decline due to factors that significantly impacted both demand and supply. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, causing travel and other restrictions to be implemented globally, the demand for commodities declined. Additionally, the supply shock late in the first quarter of 2020 from certain major oil producing nations increasing production also significantly contributed to the sharp drop in commodity prices. The drop in commodity prices resulted in prompt reactions from some domestic producers, including significantly reducing capital budgets and resultant drilling activity and shutting-in production. Our impairment assessment forecasted continued decline in natural gas production across the Mid-Continent and Gulf of Mexico regions.\nFor the 2021 and 2020 impairment assessments discussed above, we determined fair value through the use of discounted estimated cash flows to measure the impairment loss for each asset group for which undiscounted future net cash flows were not sufficient to recover the net book value.\nThe estimated cash flows used to assess recoverability of our long-lived assets and measure fair value of our asset groups are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term price and volume projections reflective of the current environment and management's projections for long-term average prices and volumes. In addition to near and long-term price assumptions, other key assumptions include volume projections, operating costs, timing of incurring such costs, and the use of an appropriate terminal value and discount rate. We believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use.\nThe fair value measurement of our long-lived assets was based, in part, on significant inputs not observable in the market (as discussed above) and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The significant unobservable inputs used include discount rates and determination of terminal values. We utilized a weighted average discount rate of\n9.5\n% and\n14.0\n% when deriving the fair value of the asset groups impaired during 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average discount rate and terminal values reflect management’s best estimate of inputs a market participant would utilize. The carrying value adjustments are included in\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nin our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe may identify additional triggering events in the future, which will require additional evaluations of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets and may result in future impairments.\nNote 6 –\nGoodwill\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $\n45.2\nmillion of goodwill included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the March 2017 acquisition of gas gathering and processing and crude oil gathering assets in the Permian Basin.\nThe future cash flows and resulting fair values of these reporting units are sensitive to changes in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices. The direct and indirect effects of significant declines in commodity prices from the date of acquisition would likely cause the fair values of these reporting units to fall below their carrying values, and could result in an impairment of goodwill.\nAs described in Note 3 – Significant Accounting Policies, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on November 30, or more frequently if we believe necessary based on events or changes in circumstances. For our 2022, 2021 and 2020 annual evaluations,\nF-\n24\nwe performed a qualitative assessment, which indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the Permian Midland and Permian Delaware reporting units were less than their carrying amounts, and therefore, a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not necessary. Our qualitative assessment considered, among other things, the overall financial performance and future outlook of the Permian Midland and Permian Delaware reporting units, industry and market considerations, and other relevant entity-specific events.\nThe fair value measurements utilized for the evaluation of goodwill for impairment are based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements. These inputs require significant judgments and estimates at the time of valuation.\nNote 7 – Investments in\nUnconsolidated Affiliates\nOur investments in unconsolidated affiliates consist of the following:\nGathering and Processing Segment\n•\n50\n% operated ownership interest in Little Missouri 4.\nLogistics and Transportation Segment\n•\n38.8\n% operated ownership interest in GCF; and\n•\n50\n% operated ownership interest in Cayenne.\nThe terms of these joint venture agreements do not afford us the degree of control required for consolidating them in our consolidated financial statements, but do afford us the significant influence required to employ the equity method of accounting.\nIn April 2022, we completed the South Texas Acquisition. Prior to closing the South Texas Acquisition, we had\ntwo\noperated joint ventures in South Texas: a\n75\n% interest in T2 LaSalle Gathering Company L.L.C. (“T2 LaSalle”) and a\n50\n% interest in T2 Eagle Ford Gathering Company L.L.C. (“T2 Eagle Ford” and, together with T2 LaSalle, the “T2 Joint Ventures”). Following the closing of the South Texas Acquisition, we own\n100\n% of the interest in the T2 Joint Ventures.\nIn May 2022, we completed the GCX Sale. Prior to the GCX Sale, we owned a\n25\n% non-operated ownership interest in GCX. Following the announcement of the GCX Sale in February 2022, we ceased recognizing equity earnings (loss) due to the terms of the sales agreement. As a result of the GCX Sale, we recognized a gain of $\n435.9\nmillion in Gain (loss) from sale of equity method investment in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2022.\nF-\n25\nThe following table shows the activity related to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates:\n(1)\nIn January 2021, GCF was temporarily idled and Targa assumed operatorship in the first half of 2021. In January 2023, we reached an agreement with our partners to reactivate GCF. The facility is expected to be operational during the first quarter of 2024.\n(2)\nFollowing the closing of the South Texas Acquisition in April 2022, the T2 Joint Ventures are\n100\n% owned and consolidated by Targa.\nOur equity loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 included the effect of impairments in the carrying values of our investments in the T2 Joint Ventures. As a result of the decrease in current and expected future utilization of the underlying assets, we determined that factors indicated that a decrease in the value of our investments occurred that was other than temporary. As a result of the evaluation, we recorded non-cash pre-tax impairment losses of $\n47.3\nmillion and $\n29.9\nmillion on our investments in T2 Eagle Ford and T2 LaSalle, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2021. The impairment losses represented our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by the joint ventures, as well as impairments of the unamortized excess fair values resulting from the purchase accounting related to the mergers with Atlas Energy L.P. and Atlas Pipeline Partners L.P. in 2015.\nF-\n26\nNote 8 — De\nbt Obligations\n(1)\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Partnership had $\n800.0\nmillion of qualifying receivables under its $\n800.0\nmillion Securitization Facility, resulting in\nzero\navailability.\n(2)\nIn February 2022, we entered into the TRGP Revolver which matures in February 2027, and terminated our previous TRGP senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Previous TRGP Revolver”) and the Partnership’s senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Partnership Revolver”). In July 2022, we established an unsecured commercial paper note program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), the borrowings of which are supported through maintaining a minimum available borrowing capacity under our TRGP Revolver equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the TRGP Revolver had $\n290.0\nmillion borrowings outstanding and the Commercial Paper Program had $\n1.0\nbillion borrowings outstanding, resulting in approximately $\n1.4\nbillion of available liquidity, after accounting for outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2021, we had no balance outstanding under the Previous TRGP Revolver or the Partnership Revolver.\n(3)\nAs of February 2022, we guarantee all of the Partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes.\nThe following table shows the range of interest rates and weighted average interest rate incurred on our variable-rate debt obligations during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022:\nCompliance with Debt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our various debt agreements.\nIn February 2022, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a parent guarantee whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of all of the obligations of the Partnership and Targa Resources Partners Finance Corporation (together with the Partnership, the “Partnership Issuers”) under the respective indentures governing the Partnership Issuers’ senior unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2022, $\n5.0\nbillion of the Partnership Issuers' senior unsecured notes was outstanding.\nF-\n27\nDebt Obligations\nPartnership’s Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility\nIn April 2022, the Partnership amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, extend the facility termination date to\nApril 19, 2023\nand replace the LIBOR-based interest rate option with SOFR-based interest rate options, including term SOFR and daily simple SOFR. In September 2022, the Partnership amended the Securitization Facility to, among other things, increase the facility size from $\n400.0\nmillion to $\n800.0\nmillion and extend the facility termination date to\nSeptember 1, 2023\n.\nThe Securitization Facility provides up to $\n800.0\nmillion of borrowing capacity at SOFR rates plus a margin through\nSeptember 1, 2023\n. Under the Securitization Facility, certain Partnership subsidiaries sell or contribute certain qualifying receivables, without recourse, to another of its consolidated subsidiaries (Targa Receivables LLC or “TRLLC”), a special purpose consolidated subsidiary created for the sole purpose of the Securitization Facility. TRLLC, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership in the eligible receivables to third-party financial institutions. Sold or contributed receivables up to the amount of the outstanding debt under the Securitization Facility are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of the selling or contributing subsidiaries or the Partnership. Any excess receivables are eligible to satisfy the claims.\nTRGP Credit Agreement\nIn February 2022, the Company entered into the TRGP Revolver with Bank of America, N.A., as the Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Swing Line Lender, and the other lenders party thereto. The TRGP Revolver provides for a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount up to $\n2.75\nbillion (with an option to increase such maximum aggregate principal amount by up to $\n500.0\nmillion in the future, subject to the terms of the TRGP Revolver) and a swing line sub-facility of up to $\n100.0\nmillion. The TRGP Revolver matures on\nFebruary 17, 2027\n.\nIn February 2022, TRGP and the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Inc., and in March 2022, the Partnership received a corporate investment grade credit rating from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”). As a result, in accordance with the TRGP Revolver, the collateral under the TRGP Revolver was released from the liens securing our obligations thereunder.\nThe revolving credit facility bears interest at the Company’s option at: (a) the Base Rate, which is the highest of Bank of America’s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus\n0.5\n% and the Term SOFR (as such term is defined in the TRGP Revolver rate plus\n1.0\n% (subject in each case to a floor of\n0.0\n%), plus an applicable margin ranging from\n0.125\n% to\n0.75\n%, dependent on the Company’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings (or, if no such debt is outstanding at such time, then the corporate, issuer or similar rating with respect to the Company that has been most recently announced) (the “Debt Rating”), or (b) Term SOFR (which includes, for Term SOFR loans, a SOFR adjustment of plus\n0.10\n%) plus an applicable margin ranging from\n1.125\n% to\n1.75\n%, dependent on the Company’s Debt Rating.\nThe Company is required to pay a commitment fee equal to an applicable rate ranging from\n0.125\n% to\n0.35\n% (dependent on the Company’s Debt Rating), in each case times the actual daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility.\nThe obligations under the TRGP Revolver are guaranteed by substantially all material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of the Company, including by the Partnership.\nThe TRGP Revolver requires the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated adjusted EBITDA (the “Consolidated Leverage Ratio”), determined as of the last day of each quarter for the four-fiscal quarter period ending on the date of determination, of no more than\n5.50\nto\n1.00\n.\nThe TRGP Revolver restricts the Company’s ability to make dividends to stockholders if a default or an event of default (as defined in the TRGP Revolver) exists or would result from such distribution. In addition, the TRGP Revolver contains various covenants that may limit, among other things, the Company’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, repay or amend the terms of certain other indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell assets, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nTerm Loan Facility\nIn July 2022, we entered into the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility provides for a\nthree-year\n, $\n1.5\nbillion unsecured term loan facility and matures in\nJuly 2025\n. We used the proceeds from the Term Loan Facility to fund a portion of the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nF-\n28\nThe Term Loan Facility bears interest at the Company’s option at: (a) the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Facility), which is the highest of the (i) federal funds rate plus\n0.5\n%, (ii) Mizuho’s prime rate, and (iii) the Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) rate plus\n1.0\n% (subject in each case to a floor of\n0.0\n%), plus an applicable margin ranging from\n0.125\n% to\n0.75\n% dependent on the Company’s non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt ratings (or, if no such debt is outstanding at such time, then the corporate, issuer or similar rating with respect to the Company that has been most recently announced) (the “Debt Rating”), or (b) Term SOFR plus\n0.10\n% plus an applicable margin ranging from\n1.125\n% to\n1.75\n% dependent on the Debt Rating\n.\nOur obligations under the Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by substantially all material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries of the Company, including the Partnership.\nThe Term Loan Facility requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Facility), determined as of the last day of each quarter for the four-fiscal-quarter-period ending on the date of determination, of no more than\n5.50\nto\n1.00\n. For any four-fiscal-quarter-period during which a material acquisition or disposition occurs, the total leverage ratio will be determined on a pro forma basis as though such event had occurred as of the first day of such four-fiscal-quarter-period.\nThe Term Loan Facility limits the Company’s ability to make dividends to stockholders if an event of default (as defined in the Term Loan Facility) exists or would result from such distribution. In addition, the Term Loan Facility contains various covenants that may limit, among other things, the Company’s ability to incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, merge or consolidate, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn July 2022, we established the Commercial Paper Program.\nUnder the terms of the Commercial Paper Program, we may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with varying maturities of less than one year.\nAmounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be issued, repaid and re-issued from time to time, with the maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed $\n2.75\nbillion. We maintain a minimum available borrowing capacity under the TRGP Revolver equal to the aggregate amount outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as support. The Commercial Paper Program is guaranteed by each subsidiary that guarantees the TRGP Revolver. The commercial paper notes are presented in Long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTRGP’s Senior Unsecured Notes\nAll issues of our senior unsecured notes (the “TRGP Notes”) rank pari passu with our existing and future senior indebtedness, including debt issued under the TRGP Revolver, the Commercial Paper Program and the Term Loan Facility, and rank senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness. The TRGP Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that guarantee the TRGP Revolver. Each guarantee ranks equally in right of payment with all of such guarantor’s existing and future unsecured senior debt and other unsecured guarantees of senior debt. The notes and the guarantees are effectively junior to any secured indebtedness of ours or any guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Interest on all issues of TRGP’s Notes are payable semi-annually.\nThe indenture governing the TRGP Notes restricts (i) our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens and (ii) TRGP’s ability to merge or consolidate with or sell, lease, convey transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to another company. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\nWe may redeem the TRGP Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable par call date at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date, as specified in the indenture of each series. After the applicable par call date, the TRGP Notes may be redeemed at a price equal to par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, as specified in the indenture of each series.\nIn the future, we may redeem, purchase or exchange certain of our outstanding debt through redemption calls, cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such calls, repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nF-\n29\nPartnership’s Senior Unsecured Notes\nAll issues of the Partnership's senior unsecured notes are pari passu with existing and future senior indebtedness. They are senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness and are unconditionally guaranteed by the Partnership and the Partnership’s restricted subsidiaries. These notes are effectively subordinated to all secured indebtedness under the TRGP Revolver and the Securitization Facility, which is secured by accounts receivable pledged under the facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. Interest on all issues of senior unsecured notes is payable semi-annually in arrears.\nThe Partnership’s senior unsecured notes and associated indenture agreements restrict (i) the Partnership’s ability and the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur liens and (ii) the Partnership's ability to merge or consolidate with or sell, lease, convey transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to another company. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.\nThe Partnership may redeem the senior unsecured notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages, if any, to the redemption date, as specified in the indenture of each series.\nThe Partnership may also redeem up to\n35\n% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of notes at the redemption dates and prices set forth in the indentures plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages, if any, to the redemption date with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that: (i) at least\n65\n% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the notes (excluding notes held by us) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and (ii) the redemption occurs within\n180\ndays of the date of the closing of such equity offering.\nIn the future, we or the Partnership may redeem, purchase or exchange certain of our and the Partnership’s outstanding debt through redemption calls, cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such calls, repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nSenior Unsecured Notes Issuances\nIn August 2020, the Partnership issued $\n1.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.875\n% Senior Notes due 2031 (the “August 2020 Offering”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n991\nmillion. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer (the “August Tender Offer”) of the Partnership’s\n6.750\n% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “6.750% Notes”) and redeem any\n6.750\n% Notes that remained outstanding after consummation of the August Tender Offer, with the remainder used for repayment of borrowings under the Previous TRGP Revolver. See “Debt Repurchases and Extinguishments” for further details of the August Tender Offer.\nIn February 2021, the Partnership issued $\n1.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.000\n% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “February 2021 Offering”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n991\nmillion. The\n4.000\n% Senior Notes due 2032 have substantially similar terms and covenants as our other series of Senior Notes. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer (the “February Tender Offer”) and subsequent redemption for the Partnership’s\n5.125\n% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “5.125% Notes”), with the remainder used for repayment of borrowings under the Partnership Revolver and Previous TRGP Revolver. See “Debt Repurchases and Extinguishments” for further details of the February Tender Offer.\nIn April 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $\n750.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n4.200\n% Senior Notes due 2033 (the “\n4.200\n% Notes”) and (ii) $\n750.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n4.950\n% Senior Notes due 2052 (the “\n4.950\n% Notes”), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n1.5\nbillion. The\n4.200\n% Notes and the\n4.950\n% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the TRGP Revolver, so long as such subsidiary guarantors satisfy certain conditions. The\n4.200\n% Notes and the\n4.950\n% Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of April 6, 2022, as supplemented by that certain First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of April 6, 2022, among us, such subsidiary guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer (the “March Tender Offer”) and the subsequent redemption of the Partnership’s\n5.875\n% Senior Notes due April 2026 (the “\n5.875\n% Notes”), with the remainder of the net proceeds used for repayment of the outstanding borrowings under the TRGP Revolver. See “Debt Repurchases and Extinguishments” for further details of the March Tender Offer.\nIn July 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering of the\n5.200\n% Notes and the\n6.250\n% Notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n1.2\nbillion. The\n5.200\n% Notes and the\n6.250\n%\nNotes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the TRGP Revolver, so long as such subsidiary guarantors satisfy certain\nF-\n30\nconditions.\nThe\n5.200\n% Notes and the\n6.250\n% Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of April 6, 2022, as supplemented by that certain Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 7, 2022, among us, such subsidiary guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. We used the net proceeds from the issuance to fund a portion of the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nDebt Repurchases & Extinguishments\nDuring the first half of 2020, the Partnership repurchased a portion of its outstanding senior notes on the open market, paying $\n239.8\nmillion plus accrued interest to repurchase $\n303.3\nmillion of the notes. As a result, we recorded a gain due to debt extinguishment of $\n61.1\nmillion.\nConcurrent with the August 2020 Offering, the Partnership commenced the August Tender Offer to purchase for cash, subject to certain terms and conditions, any and all of our outstanding\n6.750\n% Notes. We accepted for purchase all the notes that were validly tendered as of the early tender date, which totaled $\n262.1\nmillion. Subsequent to the closing of the August Tender Offer in August 2020, the Partnership redeemed the\n6.750\n% Notes for the remaining note balance of $\n318.0\nmillion (the “2024 Note Redemption”). As a result of the August Tender Offer and the 2024 Note Redemption, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n13.7\nmillion.\nIn November 2020, the Partnership redeemed the $\n559.6\nmillion remaining balance of its\n5.250\n% Senior Notes due 2023. As a result, we recorded a loss\ndue to debt extinguishment of $\n1.8\nmillion.\nConcurrent with the February 2021 Offering, the Partnership commenced the February Tender Offer to redeem subject to certain terms and conditions, any and all of our outstanding\n5.125\n% Notes. As a result of the February Tender Offer and the subsequent redemption of the 5.125% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n14.9\nmillion.\nAdditionally, Targa Pipeline Partners LP (the “TPL”) redeemed all of the outstanding TPL 4.750% Senior Notes due 2021 and TPL\n5.875\n% Senior Notes due 2023 (collectively, the “TPL Notes”) in February 2021 with available liquidity under the Partnership Revolver. As a result of the redemptions of the TPL Notes, we recorded a gain due to debt extinguishment of $\n0.2\nmillion.\nThe Partnership redeemed all of the outstanding\n4.250\n% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “4.250% Senior Notes”) in\nMay 2021\nwith available liquidity under the Partnership Revolver. As a result of the redemption of the 4.250% Senior Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n1.9\nmillion.\nIn February 2022, in connection with entering into the TRGP Revolver, we terminated the Previous TRGP Revolver and Partnership Revolver.\nAs a result of the termination of the Previous TRGP Revolver and the Partnership Revolver, we recorded a loss of $\n0.8\nmillion due to a write-off of debt issuance costs.\nThe Partnership redeemed all of the outstanding\n5.375\n% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “5.375% Notes”) in\nMarch 2022\nwith available liquidity under the TRGP Revolver. As a result of the redemption of the 5.375% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n15.0\nmillion.\nConcurrent with the\n4.200\n% Notes and the\n4.950\n% Notes offering, we commenced the March Tender Offer to redeem subject to certain terms and conditions, any and all of the Partnership's outstanding\n5.875\n% Notes. As a result of the March Tender Offer and the subsequent redemption of the 5.875% Notes, we recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $\n33.8\nmillion.\nF-\n31\nThe following table summarizes the impact of debt repurchases and extinguishments that are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nThe following table shows the contractually scheduled maturities of our debt obligations outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2022, for the next five years, and in total thereafter:\nSubsequent Event\nIn January 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of (i) $\n900.0\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of our\n6.125\n% Senior Notes due 2033 and (ii) $\n850.0\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of our\n6.500\n% Senior Notes due 2053, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $\n1.7\nbillion. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance to fund the Grand Prix Transaction and the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including to reduce borrowings under the TRGP Revolver and the Commercial Paper Program.\nNote 9 — Other\nLong-term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities are comprised of the following obligations:\nF-\n32\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n198.8\nmillion and $\n171.8\nmillion, respectively, which includes $\n129.0\nmillion of payments received from Vitol Americas Corp. (“Vitol”) (formerly known as Noble Americas Corp.), a subsidiary of Vitol US Holding Co., in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as part of an agreement (the “Splitter Agreement”) related to the construction and operation of a crude oil and condensate splitter. In December 2018, Vitol elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement. The Splitter Agreement provides that the first three annual payments are ours if Vitol elects to terminate, which Vitol disputes. The timing of revenue recognition related to the Splitter Agreement deferred revenue is dependent on the outcome of current litigation with Vitol. See Note 18 - Contingencies for more information.\nDeferred revenue includes nonmonetary consideration received in a 2015 amendment (the “gas contract amendment”) to a gas gathering and processing agreement. We measured the estimated fair value of the gathering assets transferred to us using significant other observable inputs representative of a Level 2 fair value measurement. In December 2017, we received monetary consideration to further amend the terms of the gas gathering and processing agreement. The deferred revenue related to these amendments is being recognized through the end of the agreement’s term in 2035.\nDeferred revenue also includes contributions in aid of construction received from customers for which revenue is recognized over the expected contract term.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $\n7.5\nmillion, $\n3.9\nmillion and $\n3.8\nmillion of revenue for these transactions, respectively.\nThe following table shows the components of deferred revenue:\n(1)\nAmount reflects additions of deferred revenue related to the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nThe following table shows the changes in deferred revenue:\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur ARO primarily relate to certain gas gathering pipelines and processing facilities and NGL pipelines.\nThe changes in our ARO are as follows:\n(1)\nAmount reflects additions of ARO related to the Delaware Basin Acquisition.\nF-\n33\nNote 10 – L\neases\nWe have non-cancellable operating leases primarily associated with our office facilities, rail assets, land, storage and terminal assets. We have finance leases primarily associated with our substations, compressors, tractors and vehicles. Our leases have remaining lease terms of\n1\nto\n10\nyears, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to\n20\nyears.\nThe balances of right-of-use assets and liabilities of finance leases and operating leases, and their locations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\n(1)\nThe December 31, 2022 balance includes $\n171.2\nmillion of assets and $\n167.0\nmillion of liabilities related to compressor leases from the Delaware Basin Acquisition that were subsequently amended and extended.\nOperating lease costs and short-term lease costs are included in Operating expenses or General and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, depending on the nature of the leases. Finance lease costs are included in Depreciation and amortization expense and Interest expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The components of lease expense were as follows:\nOther supplemental information related to our leases are as follows:\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms for operating leases and finance leases are\n5\nyears\nand\n7\nyears\n, respectively. The weighted-average discount rates for operating leases and finance leases are\n4.0\n%\nand\n4.8\n%\n, respectively.\nThe following table presents the maturities of our lease liabilities under non-cancellable leases as of December 31,\n2022:\nF-\n34\nNote 11 – P\nreferred Stock\nPreferred Stock\nPrior to the redemption in May 2022, our Series A Preferred had a liquidation value of $\n1,000\nper share and bore a cumulative\n9.5\n%\nfixed dividend payable quarterly 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter\n. The Series A Preferred had no mandatory redemption date, but was redeemable at our election on or prior to March 16, 2022 for a\n10\n% premium to the liquidation preference and for a\n5\n% premium to the liquidation preference thereafter.\nThe Series A Preferred ranked senior to the common outstanding stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions in liquidation. The holders of Series A Preferred generally only had voting rights in certain circumstances, subject to certain exceptions, which included:\n•\nthe issuance or the increase by the Company of any specific class or series of stock that was senior to the Series A Preferred,\n•\nthe issuance or the increase by any of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries of any specific class or series of securities,\n•\nchanges to the Certificates of Incorporation or Designations of the Series A Preferred that would have materially and adversely affected the Preferred Stock holder,\n•\nthe issuance of stock on parity with the Series A Preferred, subject to certain exceptions, if the Company had exceeded a stipulated fixed charge coverage ratio or an aggregate amount of net proceeds from all future issuances of Parity Stock, or would have used the proceeds of such issuance to pay dividends,\n•\nthe incurrence of indebtedness, other than indebtedness that complies with a stipulated fixed charge coverage ratio or under the TRGP Revolver (or replacement commercial bank facilities) in an aggregate amount up to $\n2.75\nbillion.\nThe Series A Preferred did not qualify as a liability instrument\nbecause it was not mandatorily redeemable. However, as SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 5-02-27 does not permit a probability assessment for a change of control provision, our Series A Preferred must be presented as mezzanine equity between liabilities and shareholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets because a change of control event, although not considered probable, could have forced the Company to redeem the Series A Preferred. A maximum of\n44,260,953\ncommon shares would have been issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred.\nPreferred Stock Partial Redemption\nIn December 2020, we repurchased\n45,800\nshares of the Series A Preferred at $\n1,000\nper share (the “Liquidation Preference”), plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends through the repurchase date. The repurchase was executed at a discount relative to the redemption price of $\n1,100\nper share (the Liquidation Preference multiplied by\n110\n%), which became effective March 16, 2021. The difference between the consideration paid (including unpaid dividends of $\n1.1\nmillion) and the net carrying value of the shares repurchased was $\n2.7\nmillion, which was recorded as an addition to preferred stock dividends for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPreferred Stock Redemption\nIn May 2022, we redeemed all of our issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred at a redemption price of $\n1,050.00\nper share, plus $\n8.87\nper share, which is the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends from April 1, 2022 up to, but not including, the redemption date of\nMay 3, 2022\n. The difference between the consideration paid of $\n973.4\nmillion (including unpaid dividends of $\n8.2\nmillion) and the net carrying value of the shares redeemed was $\n223.7\nmillion, of which $\n215.5\nmillion was recorded as deemed dividends in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the second quarter of 2022. Following the redemption, we have no Series A Preferred outstanding and all rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred were terminated.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $\n51.8\nmillion of dividends to preferred shareholders. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we paid $\n87.3\nmillion and $\n91.7\nmillion of dividends at a rate of $\n23.75\nper share each quarter to Series A Preferred shareholders, and recorded deemed dividends of $\n39.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, attributable to accretion of the preferred discount resulting from the beneficial conversion feature accounting model. Such accretion was included in the book value of the Series A Preferred. After adoption of ASU 2020-06,\nDebt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity\nin 2021, we no longer recognize such accretion.\nF-\n35\nNote 12 — C\nommon Stock and Related Matters\nPublic Offerings of Common Stock\nOn May 9, 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under the May 2016 Shelf (the “May 2017 EDA”), pursuant to which we may sell through our sales agents, at our option, up to an aggregated amount of $\n750.0\nmillion of our common stock (“2017 ATM Program”).\nOn September 20, 2018, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under the May 2016 Shelf (the “September 2018 EDA”), pursuant to which we may sell through our sales agents, at our option, up to an aggregated amount of $\n750.0\nmillion of our common stock (“2018 ATM Program”).\nIn May 2019, we filed (i) the May 2019 Shelf, (ii) a new prospectus supplement to continue the 2017 ATM Program and (iii) a new prospectus supplement to continue the 2018 ATM Program.\nIn March 2022, we filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that registers the issuance and sale of certain debt and equity securities from time to time in one or more offerings (the “March 2022 Shelf”). The March 2022 Shelf will expire in March 2025.\nDuring 2020, 2021 and\n2022\n,\nno\nshares of common stock were issued under either the May 2017 EDA or the September 2018 EDA. As a result, we have $\n382.1\nmillion and $\n750.0\nmillion remaining under the May 2017 EDA and September 2018 EDA, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\nCommon Share Repurchase Program\nIn October 2020, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the \"Share Repurchase Program\") for the repurchase of up to $\n500.0\nmillion of our outstanding common stock.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased\n3,412,354\nshares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $\n65.87\nfor a total net cost of $\n224.8\nmillion. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased\n756,478\nshares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $\n52.81\nfor a total net cost of $\n40.0\nmillion. There was $\n143.8\nmillion remaining under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2022.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nIn January 2022, we declared an increase to our common dividend to $\n0.35\nper common share or $\n1.40\nper common share annualized effective for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe following table details the dividends declared and/or paid by us to common shareholders for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n(1)\nRepresents accrued dividends on restricted stock and restricted stock units that are payable upon vesting.\nF-\n36\nNote 13 — Ea\nrnings per Common Share\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income and weighted average shares outstanding used in computing basic and diluted net income per common share:\n(1)\nRepresents premium paid on the DevCo JV Repurchase. See Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n(2)\nIncludes $\n8.2\nmillion and $\n1.1\nmillion attributable to the dividends paid upon the full redemption and partial repurchase of Series A Preferred in 2022 and 2020, respectively.\n(3)\nIncludes $\n215.5\nmillion and $\n1.6\nmillion attributable to the full redemption and partial repurchase of Series A Preferred in 2022 and 2020, respectively. See Note 11 – Preferred Stock for further discussion.\n(4)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, all unvested restricted stock awards and Series A Preferred were antidilutive because a net loss existed for each of those periods.\nThe following potential common stock equivalents are excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per share because the inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive (in millions on a weighted-average basis):\n(1)\nThe Series A Preferred had no mandatory redemption date, but was redeemable at our election for a\n5\n% premium to the liquidation preference subsequent to\nMarch 16, 2022\n. In May 2022, we redeemed all of our issued and outstanding Series A Preferred at a redemption price of $\n1,050.00\nper share, plus $\n8.87\nper share, which is the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends from April 1, 2022 up to, but not including, the redemption date of\nMay 3, 2022\n. See Note 11 – Preferred Stock for further discussion.\nNot\ne 14 — Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to manage our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce volatility in our operating cash flow due to fluctuations in commodity prices. We have entered into derivative instruments to hedge the commodity price risks associated with a portion of our expected (i) natural gas, NGL, and condensate equity volumes in our Gathering and Processing operations that result from percent-of-proceeds processing arrangements, (ii) future commodity purchases and sales in our Logistics and Transportation segment and (iii) natural gas transportation basis risk in our Logistics and Transportation segment. The hedge positions associated with (i) and (ii) above will move favorably in periods of falling commodity prices and unfavorably in periods of rising commodity prices and are primarily designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.\nThe hedges generally match the NGL product composition and the NGL delivery points of our physical equity volumes. Our natural gas hedges are a mixture of specific gas delivery points and Henry Hub. The NGL hedges may be transacted as specific NGL hedges or as baskets of ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline based upon our expected equity NGL composition. We believe this approach avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as “proxy” hedges of NGL prices. Our natural gas and NGL hedges are settled using published index prices for delivery at various locations.\nWe hedge a portion of our condensate equity volumes using crude oil hedges that are based on the NYMEX futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate light, sweet crude, which approximates the prices received for condensate. This exposes us to a market differential risk if the NYMEX futures do not move in exact parity with the sales price of our underlying condensate equity volumes.\nWe also enter into derivative instruments to help manage other short-term commodity-related business risks and take advantage of market opportunities. We have not designated these derivatives as hedges and record changes in fair value and cash settlements to revenues as current income.\nF-\n37\nAt\nDecember 31, 2022, the notional volumes of our commodity derivative contracts were:\nOur derivative contracts are subject to netting arrangements that permit our contracting subsidiaries to net cash settle offsetting asset and liability positions with the same counterparty within the same Targa entity. The master netting provisions reduced our maximum loss due to counterparty credit risk by $\n19.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. The range of losses attributable to our individual counterparties would be between $\n1.9\nmillion and $\n16.4\nmillion, depending on the counterparty in default. We record derivative assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, without considering the effect of master netting arrangements.\nThe following schedules reflect the fair value of our derivative instruments and their location on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as pro forma reporting assuming that we reported derivatives subject to master netting agreements on a net basis:\nF-\n38\nThe pro forma impact of reporting derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis is as follows:\nSome of our hedges are futures contracts executed through brokers that clear the hedges through an exchange. We maintain a margin deposit with the brokers in an amount sufficient to cover the fair value of our open futures positions. The margin deposit is considered collateral, which is located within Other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is not offset against the fair value of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments other than our futures contracts are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) agreements, which govern the key terms with our counterparties. Our ISDA agreements contain credit-risk related contingent features. Following the release of the collateral securing our TRGP Revolver, our derivative positions are no longer secured. As of December 31, 2022, we have outstanding net derivative positions that contain credit-risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position of\n$\n266.7\nmillion. We have not been required to post any collateral related to these positions due to our credit rating. If our credit rating was to be downgraded one notch below investment grade by both Moody’s and S&P, as defined in our ISDAs, we estimate that as of December 31, 2022, we would be required to post $\n31.4\nmillion of collateral to certain counterparties per the terms of our ISDAs.\nThe fair value of our derivative instruments, depending on the type of instrument, was determined by the use of present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. The estimated fair value of our derivative instruments was a net liability of\n$\n255.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. The estimated fair value is net of an adjustment for credit risk based on the default probabilities as indicated by market quotes for the counterparties’ credit default swap rates. The credit risk adjustment was immaterial for all periods presented. Our futures contracts that are cleared through an exchange are margined daily and do not require any credit adjustment.\nF-\n39\nThe following tables reflect amounts recorded in OCI and amounts reclassified from OCI to revenue for the periods indicated:\nBased on valuations as of December 31, 2022, we expect to reclassify commodity hedge related deferred gains of\n$\n63.4\nmillion included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings before income taxes through the end of 2025, with\n$\n70.1\nmillion of gains to be reclassified over the next twelve months.\nOur consolidated earnings are also affected by the use of the mark-to-market method of accounting for derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or that have not been designated as hedges. The changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheet and through earnings rather than being deferred until the anticipated transaction settles.\nThe use of mark-to-market accounting for financial instruments can cause non-cash earnings volatility due to changes in the underlying commodity price indices. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022\n, the unrealized mark-to-market losses are primarily attributable to unfavorable movements in natural gas forward basis prices, as compared to our positions.\nSee Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements and Note 24 – Segment Information for additional disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nNote\n15 — Fair Value Measurements\nUnder GAAP, our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a mixture of measurement methods for financial assets and liabilities (“financial instruments”). Derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other financial instruments are reported at historical cost or amortized cost on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following are additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding fair value measurements of financial instruments.\nFair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments\nOur derivative instruments consist of financially settled commodity swaps, futures, option contracts and fixed-price forward commodity contracts with certain counterparties. We determine the fair value of our derivative contracts using present value methods or standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and we believe we have obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts we hold.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The derivatives at December 31, 2022, represent a net liability of\n$\n255.8\nmillion, and reflects the present value, adjusted for counterparty credit risk, of the amount we expect to receive or pay in the future on our derivative contracts. If forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil were to increase by 10%, the result would be a fair value reflecting a net liability of\n$\n455.3\nmillion. If forward pricing on natural gas, NGLs and crude oil were to decrease by 10%, the result would be a fair value reflecting a net liability of\n$\n56.3\nmillion.\nFair Value of Other Financial Instruments\nDue to their cash or near-cash nature, the carrying value of other financial instruments included in working capital (i.e., cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable) approximates their fair value. Long-term debt is primarily the other financial instrument for which carrying value could vary significantly from fair value. We determined the supplemental fair value disclosures for our long-term debt as follows:\n•\nthe TRGP Revolver, commercial paper notes, Securitization Facility and Term Loan Facility are based on carrying value, which approximates fair value as their interest rates are based on prevailing market rates; and\n•\nthe TRGP senior unsecured notes and the Partnership’s senior unsecured notes are based on quoted market prices derived from trades of the debt.\nF-\n40\nFair Value Hierarchy\nWe categorize the inputs to the fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities at each balance sheet reporting date using a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the significant inputs used in measuring fair value:\n•\nLevel 1 – observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n•\nLevel 2 – inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that we can directly or indirectly observe to the extent that the markets are liquid for the relevant settlement periods; and\n•\nLevel 3 – unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore we must develop our own assumptions.\nThe following table shows a breakdown by fair value hierarchy category for (1) financial instruments measurements included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and (2) supplemental fair value disclosures for other financial instruments:\n(1)\nThe fair value of derivative contracts in this table is presented on a different basis than the Consolidated Balance Sheets presentation as disclosed in Note 14 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The above fair values reflect the total value of each derivative contract taken as a whole, whereas the Consolidated Balance Sheets presentation is based on the individual maturity dates of estimated future settlements. As such, an individual contract could have both an asset and liability position when segregated into its current and long-term portions for Consolidated Balance Sheets classification purposes\n.\nAdditional Information Regarding Level 3 Fair Value Measurements Included on Our Consolidated Balance Sheets\nWe report certain of our swaps and option contracts at fair value using Level 3 inputs due to such derivatives not having observable market prices or implied volatilities for substantially the full term of the derivative asset or liability. For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations whose contract length extends into unobservable periods. The fair value of these swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow valuation technique, for which the primary input to the valuation model is the forward commodity basis curve, and is based on observable or public data sources and extrapolated when observable prices are not available.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of our Level 3 derivatives were (i) the forward natural gas liquids pricing curves, for which a significant portion of the derivative’s term is beyond available forward pricing and (ii) implied volatilities, which are unobservable as a result of inactive natural gas liquids options trading. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021\n, we had\nno\nderivative contracts categorized as Level 3.\nF-\n41\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities, such as long-lived assets, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at acquisition or whenever impairment indicators are present. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment of $\n452.3\nmillion. The impairment charge is primarily associated with the partial impairment of certain gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our Central operations in the Gathering and Processing segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded non-cash pre-tax impairments of $\n2,442.8\nmillion. The impairment charge is primarily associated with the partial impairment of certain gas processing facilities and gathering systems associated with our Central operations and full impairment of our Coastal operations. For disclosures related to valuation techniques, see Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 5 – Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets.\nThe techniques described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different techniques or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nNot\ne 16 — Related Party Transactions\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe following table summarizes transactions with unconsolidated affiliates:\n(1)\nFollowing the closing of the South Texas Acquisition in April 2022, the T2 Joint Ventures are\n100\n% owned and consolidated by Targa.\n(2)\nFollowing the closing of the GCX Sale in May 2022, Targa no longer has an ownership interest in GCX.\nRelationship with Targa Resources Partners LP\nWe provide general and administrative and other services to the Partnership, associated with the Partnership’s existing assets and assets acquired from third parties. The Partnership Agreement between the Partnership and us, as general partner of the Partnership, governs the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of the Partnership.\nThe employees supporting the Partnership’s operations are our employees. The Partnership reimburses us for the payment of certain operating expenses, including compensation and benefits of operating personnel assigned to the Partnership’s assets, and for the provision of various general and administrative services for the benefit of the Partnership. We perform centralized corporate functions for the Partnership, such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance, risk management, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, internal audit, taxes, engineering and marketing.\nF-\n42\nNote\n17 — Commitments\nFuture non-cancelable commitments related to certain contractual obligations are presented below for each of the next five fiscal years and in aggregate thereafter:\n(1)\nLand site lease and rights of way provides for surface and underground access for gathering, processing and distribution assets that are located on property not owned by us. These agreements expire at various dates, with varying terms, some of which are perpetual.\nTotal expenses incurred under the above non-cancelable commitments were:\nNote 18 –\nContingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nWe and the Partnership are parties to various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. We and the Partnership are also parties to various proceedings with governmental environmental agencies, including, but not limited to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, New Mexico Environment Department, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, which assert monetary sanctions for alleged violations of environmental regulations, including air emissions, discharges into the environment and reporting deficiencies, related to events that have arisen at certain of our facilities in the ordinary course of our business.\nOn\nDecember 26, 2018\n, Vitol filed a lawsuit in the 80th District Court of Harris County (the “District Court”), Texas against Targa Channelview LLC, then a subsidiary of the Company (“Targa Channelview”), seeking recovery of $\n129.0\nmillion in payments made to Targa Channelview, additional monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. Vitol alleges that Targa Channelview breached the Splitter Agreement, which provided for Targa Channelview to construct a crude oil and condensate splitter (the “Splitter”) adjacent to a barge dock owned by Targa Channelview to provide services contemplated by the Splitter Agreement. In January 2018, Vitol acquired Noble Americas Corp. and on December 23, 2018, Vitol voluntarily elected to terminate the Splitter Agreement claiming that Targa Channelview failed to timely achieve start-up of the Splitter. Vitol’s lawsuit also alleges Targa Channelview made a series of misrepresentations about the capability of the barge dock that would service crude oil and condensate volumes to be processed by the Splitter and Splitter products. Vitol seeks return of $\n129.0\nmillion in payments made to Targa Channelview prior to the start-up of the Splitter, as well as additional damages. On the same date that Vitol filed its lawsuit, Targa Channelview filed a lawsuit against Vitol seeking a judicial determination that Vitol’s sole and exclusive remedy was Vitol’s voluntarily termination of the Splitter Agreement and, as a result, Vitol was not entitled to the return of any prior payments under the Splitter Agreement or other damages as alleged. Targa also seeks recovery of its attorneys’ fees and costs in the lawsuit.\nOn\nOctober 15, 2020\n, the District Court awarded Vitol $\n129.0\nmillion (plus interest) following a bench trial. In addition, the District Court awarded Vitol $\n10.5\nmillion in damages for losses and demurrage on crude oil that Vitol purchased for start-up efforts. The Company appealed the award in the Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston, Texas. In October 2020, we sold Targa Channelview but, under the agreements governing the sale, we retained the liabilities associated with the Vitol proceedings. On September 13, 2022, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals upheld the trial court’s judgment in part with regard to the return of Vitol’s prior payments, but modified the judgment to delete Vitol’s ability to recover any damages related to losses or demurrage on crude oil. We have filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of Texas, and the appeal remains pending. The cumulative amount of interest on the award through December 31, 2022, if accrued, would have been approximately $\n42.6\nmillion.\nF-\n43\nNote 19 –\nRevenue\nFixed consideration allocated to remaining performance obligations\nThe following table presents the estimated minimum revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the reporting period, and is comprised of fixed consideration primarily attributable to contracts with minimum volume commitments, for which a guaranteed amount of revenue can be calculated. These contracts are comprised primarily of gathering and processing, fractionation, export, terminaling and storage agreements, with remaining contract terms ranging from\n1\nto\n17 years\n.\nBased on the optional exemptions that we elected to apply, the amounts presented in the table above exclude remaining performance obligations for (i) variable consideration for which the allocation exception is met and (ii) contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.\nFor additional information on our revenue recognition policy, see Note 3 – Significant Accounting Policies, and for disclosures related to disaggregated revenue, see Note 24 – Segment Information.\nNot\ne 20 – Other Operating (Income) Expense\nOther operating (income) expense is comprised of the following:\n(1)\nPrimarily related to the sale of assets in Channelview, Texas in 2020. See Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures for further discussion regarding these sales.\n(2)\nRelated to the write-down of certain assets to their recoverable amounts.\nNote 21 – Inco\nme Taxes\nComponents of the federal and state income tax provisions for the periods indicated are as follows:\nOur deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 consist of recognition differences related to certain types of costs as follows:\nF-\n44\n(1)\nOur deferred tax liability attributable to investments reflects the differences between the book and tax carrying values of our investment in the Partnership.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted.\nThe CARES Act provided corporate taxpayers an expanded\nfive-year\nnet operating loss (“NOL”) carryback period for losses generated in tax years 2018 through 2020.\nAdditionally, the CARES Act allowed corporate taxpayers to request an immediate refund of alternative minimum tax credits. We requested a cash refund from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of approximately $\n44\nmillion related to the CARES Act provisions and received the refund in the second quarter of 2020.\nOn October 6, 2021 and April 7, 2022, we received notice from the IRS that it intends to audit three direct and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (Targa Resources Partners LP, Targa Downstream LLC and Targa Midstream Services LLC) treated as partnerships for federal tax purposes for the\n2019 and 2020\ntax years.\nWe are responding to the information requests from the IRS on these audits. The Company is not aware of any potential audit findings that would give rise to adjustments to taxable income and does not anticipate material changes related to these audits.\nAll federal statutes of limitations for returns filed in 2019 (for calendar year 2018) have expired. For Texas, the statute of limitations has expired for 2018 returns (for calendar year 2017). Similarly, the statute of limitations expired on substantially all 2018 state income tax returns that were filed prior to October 15, 2019. However, tax authorities have the ability to review and adjust carryover attributes (e.g., NOLs) generated in a closed tax year if utilized in an open tax year.\nDuring the preparation of the Company's 2021 consolidated financial statements, the Company identified errors related to its 2020 state tax provision. The Company does not believe these errors are material to its previously issued historical consolidated financial statements for any of the periods impacted and accordingly, has not adjusted the historical financial statements. In 2021, the Company recorded an additional $\n23.3\nmillion of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and corresponding increase to its deferred tax liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have total NOL carryforwards of $\n6.8\nbillion, $\n1.4\nbillion of which will expire between\n2036\nand\n2037\n. The remaining $\n5.4\nbillion NOL will not expire, but is limited to offsetting\n80\n% of taxable income per year. During 2020, we recorded a federal tax-effected valuation allowance of $\n194.2\nmillion against our deferred tax assets, primarily due to the tax consequences of the impairment of long-lived assets. See Note 5 – Property Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets. As of\nDecember 31, 2022\n, our tax effected valuation allowance was $\n36.9\nmillion, a decrease of $\n177.5\nmillion from\nDecember 31, 2021\n. Of this valuation allowance, $\n6.4\nmillion of the valuation allowance is federal, and the remaining $\n30.5\nmillion is state.\nSet forth below is the reconciliation between our Income tax provision (benefit) computed at the United States statutory rate on income before income taxes and the income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:\nWe have not identified any uncertain tax positions. We believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Therefore,\nno\nreserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) which, among other things, introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax (the “CAMT”), imposed a\n1\n% excise tax on stock buybacks and tax incentives to promote clean energy. Under the CAMT, a\n15\n% minimum tax will be imposed on certain financial statement income of “applicable corporations.” The IRA treats a corporation as an applicable corporation in for any taxable year in which the “average annual adjusted financial statement income” of such corporation for the three taxable year period ending prior to such taxable year exceeds $\n1\nbillion.\nF-\n45\nOn December 27, 2022, the Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued guidance on the application of the CAMT which may be relied upon until final regulations are released. Based on our interpretation of the IRA, the CAMT and related guidance and a number of operational, economic, accounting and regulatory assumptions, we do not anticipate qualifying as an “applicable corporation” in the near term, but we are likely to become an applicable corporation in a subsequent tax year. If we become an applicable corporation and our CAMT liability is greater than our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for any particular tax year, the CAMT liability would effectively accelerate our future U.S. federal income tax obligations, reducing our cash available for distribution in that year, but provide an offsetting credit against our regular U.S. federal income tax liability for a future year. As a result, our current expectation is that the impact of the CAMT is limited to timing differences in future tax years. Given the complexities of the IRA and the CAMT, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential future impact to our financial statements.\nSubsequent Events\nIn January 2023, the IRS notified us that it completed the examination of Targa’s NOL carryback and associated refund previously claimed under the CARES Act with no exceptions.\nAdditionally, in January 2023, we received notice from the IRS that it intends to audit an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Targa Badlands Holdings LLC) which is treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes for the 2020 tax year.\nNote 22 - S\nupplemental Cash Flow Information\n(1)\nInterest capitalized on major projects was $\n16.3\nmillion, $\n4.1\nmillion and $\n33.0\nmillion for the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 and 2020\n.\n(2)\nRepresents the transfer of an undivided interest in certain gas gathering and processing facilities to a joint owner upon Targa's recovery of a specified payout amount for our initial full funding of the facilities.\n(3)\nThe December 31, 2022 balance includes $\n171.2\nmillion related to compressor leases from the Delaware Basin Acquisition that were subsequently amended and extended.\nNote 23 – Co\nmpensation Plans\n2010 Targa Resources Corp. Stock Incentive Plan\nIn December 2010, we adopted the Targa Resources Corp. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2010 TRGP Plan”) for employees, consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. In May 2017, the 2010 TRGP Plan was amended and restated. Total authorized shares of common stock under the plan is\n15,000,000\n, comprised of\n5,000,000\nshares originally available and an additional\n10,000,000\nshares that became available in May 2017. The 2010 TRGP Plan allows for the grant of (i) incentive stock options qualified as such under U.S. federal income tax laws (“Incentive Options”), (ii) stock options that do not qualify as Incentive Options (“Non-statutory Options,” and together with Incentive Options, “Options”), (iii) stock appreciation rights granted in conjunction with Options or Phantom Stock Awards, (iv) restricted stock awards, (v) phantom stock awards, (vi) bonus stock awards, (vii) performance unit awards, or (viii) any combination of such awards.\nUnless otherwise specified, the compensation costs for the awards listed below were recognized as expenses over related vesting periods based on the grant-date fair values, reduced by forfeitures incurred.\nF-\n46\nRestricted Stock Awards\n- Restricted stock entitles the recipient to cash dividends. Dividends on unvested restricted stock will be accrued when declared and recorded as short-term or long-term liabilities, dependent on the time remaining until payment of the dividends, and paid in cash when the award vests. Upon issuance, the restricted stock awards will be included in the outstanding shares of our common stock. The Compensation Committee of the Targa board of directors (the “Compensation Committee”) awarded our common stock to our outside directors. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we issued\n31,117\n,\n67,591\nand\n31,621\nshares of director grants with weighted average grant-date fair values of $\n56.32\n, $\n30.33\nand $\n39.85\n, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units Awards –\nRestricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) are similar to restricted stock, except that shares of common stock are not issued until the RSUs vest. The vesting periods generally vary from\none\nto\nsix years\n. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we issued\n943,352\n,\n848,630\nand\n1,299,592\nshares of RSUs with weighted average grant-date fair values of $\n63.87\n, $\n37.94\nand $\n24.64\n.\nRestricted Stock Units in Lieu of Bonus\n– In 2020 and 2019, we granted\n81,336\nand\n95,687\nshares of RSUs in lieu of cash bonuses for certain of our executives at the weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n41.39\nand $\n42.83\n. The 2020 and 2019 grants vested in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the restricted stock and RSUs under the 2010 TRGP Plan in shares and in dollars for the year indicated.\nPerformance Share Units\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020\n, we granted\n173,011\n,\n319,320\nand\n291,365\nperformance share units (“PSUs”) to executive management for the\n2022, 2021 and 2020\ncompensation cycle that will vest/have vested in\nJanuary 2025\n,\nJanuary 2024\nand\nJanuary 2023\n. The PSUs granted under\nthe 2010 TRGP Plan are\nthree-year\nequity-settled awards linked to the performance of shares of our common stock. The awards also include dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”) that are based on the notional dividends accumulated during the vesting period.\nThe vesting of the PSUs is dependent on the satisfaction of a combination of certain service-related conditions and the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the members of a specified comparator group of publicly-traded midstream companies (the “LTIP Peer Group”) measured over designated periods. For the PSUs granted in 2020, 2021 and 2022, the TSR performance factor is determined by the Compensation Committee based on relative TSR over a cumulative three-year performance period. The Compensation Committee determines a guideline performance percentage for the performance period and the percentage may then be decreased or increased by the Compensation Committee at its discretion. The grantee will become vested in a number of PSUs equal to the target number awarded multiplied by the TSR performance factor, and vested PSUs will be settled by the issuance of Company common stock. The value of dividend equivalent rights will be paid in cash when the awards vest.\nCompensation cost for equity-settled PSUs was recognized as an expense over the performance period based on fair value at the grant date. The compensation cost will be reduced if forfeitures occur. Fair value was calculated using a simulated share price that incorporates peer ranking. DERs associated with equity-settled PSUs were accrued over the performance period as a reduction of owners’ equity. We evaluated the grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and historical volatility assumption with an expected term of\nthree years\n. The expected volatilities were\n80\n%,\n80\n% and\n32\n% for PSUs granted in\n2022, 2021 and 2020.\nF-\n47\nThe following table summarizes the PSUs under the 2010 TRGP Plan in shares and in dollars for the years indicated.\nStock Compensation Expenses\nStock compensation expense under our plans totaled $\n57.5\nmillion, $\n59.2\nmillion, and $\n66.3\nmillion for the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
