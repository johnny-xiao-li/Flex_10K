    "text": "We are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Our customers range from small-and-medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) to large global enterprises and governmental entities. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers.\nWe use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.\nOur Strategy\nOver the last several years, new megatrends around edge, cloud, data, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) have emerged to shape customer expectations for enterprise technology. First, data at the edge is increasing exponentially, driven by the proliferation of devices that require secure connectivity to enable reliable digital experiences. Second, enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever they live across a distributed enterprise. Third, data growth is creating countless new opportunities to generate meaningful business insights. Finally, HPE is seeing an immense demand shift in AI as customers realize the fundamental potential of the technology to deliver business transformation. Customer response to these megatrends was accelerated by the pandemic and the increasing pace of technological innovation.\nIn concert with these trends, enterprises are consuming their technology differently. Increasingly, customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the information technology (“IT”) they use.\nThe megatrends are ushering in long-lasting changes to IT, including accelerating hybrid multi-cloud adoption. Customers across industry verticals are interested in unifying all the applications and data with a consistent cloud experience.\nCustomers also want to better extract value from their growing stores of rapidly evolving data, knowing that actionable insights from data are critical to deliver business transformations. Data is becoming more unstructured, more time-sensitive and more distributed. Frequently, data is siloed and spread across different multi-gen IT systems, often trapped in critical legacy architecture. Many organizations cannot adequately gain insights from their data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications. Customers need a data-first modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud.\nHPE has deployed an edge-to-cloud strategy that capitalizes on emergent megatrends and delivers a data-first modernization approach for customers. Our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company has led us to innovate our solutions across connectivity, cloud, and data. We have shifted our mix of products and services, and how we deliver that mix to customers. HPE has evolved to a platform-based model, fueled by a portfolio richer in software and services. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is a centerpiece of our strategy; it accelerates multi-generation IT transformation through a unified cloud services experience that empowers customers to access, analyze, and extract value from their data across public clouds, data centers, colocation facilities, and at the edge.\nOur solutions across connectivity, cloud, and data are delivered as-a-service (“aaS”) through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform across our Intelligent Edge, Compute, High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”), and Storage business segments. Financial Services complements our solution offerings by helping customers unlock financial capacity.\nWe recognize the AI market will be driven by computational capability, data-intensive workloads, and the need for specialized architecture; thus, we are targeting three areas: supercomputing, AI infrastructure, and AI platform software. We believe that we are differentiated from our competition in the ability to capture significant value from the growing AI market through our intellectual property portfolio, trusted expertise, and long-term sustained market leadership in supercomputing.\n2\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt HPE we are united by our purpose, which is to advance the way people live and work. We believe technology’s greatest promise lies in its potential for positive change. This is the guidepost for each decision we make at HPE. We believe it not only helps guide our contribution to society, but also makes good business sense. Our company always strives to be an engine of innovation, and our approximately 62,000 employees as of October 31, 2023, are proud of the ways our technology enables our customers to achieve meaningful outcomes like curing disease, modernizing farming, addressing world-hunger, and democratizing transportation through autonomous vehicles.\nOur Culture\n- We recognize the critical importance of talent and culture to the success of HPE and our ability to fulfill our purpose. We are passionate about the values that drive our success, which is why we believe in investing in our team members and in the communities where we live and work. We have identified four key cultural beliefs that guide how we lead on a daily basis:  accelerating what’s next, bold moves, the “power of yes we can,” and being a force for good. We embed these beliefs in a deep-rooted DNA that puts customers first, enabling us to partner, innovate, and act with integrity. HPE has remained committed to its focus on internalizing these values into a vibrant culture that creates a superior team member experience and a highly engaged workforce, driving improvements across our communications, our reward programs, our talent/performance programs, and our work environment. Through such efforts, we aim to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and inspiring experience for all our team members and to make HPE a destination for talent while driving high-performance and growth opportunities for our team members, and innovation and excellence for our customers. In the midst of the above, we continually seek feedback from our team members to better understand and improve their experiences and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. Our most recent global engagement survey shows how these intentional efforts are making a difference, with an 86% response rate and our overall Employee Engagement Index, an index designed to capture team member engagement, measuring 83%. More than 84% of those who responded would recommend HPE as a great place to work, and 88% say they are proud to work for HPE.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) -\nWe are committed to creating an unconditionally  inclusive workplace and to capturing the ideas and perspectives that advance the way we live and work by enabling our workforce, customers, and communities to succeed in the digital age. This is because, by harnessing the potential of our technologies and our team members, we can fuel innovation, drive transformational changes, and be a force for good. Annual aspirational goals are set to drive consistent representation in the recruiting pipeline in line with market availability across all demographics. At the close of fiscal 2023, the representation of worldwide female executives in our workforce had increased 1.9 percentage points since the prior year, with increased representation at every level in worldwide female team members. We also increased our year-over-year representation of underrepresented minorities in the U.S. by 2.3 percentage points overall. We are committed to delivering on our focus on equity, as well, by taking a data-led approach at various points across the team member lifecycle to evaluate and improve our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The DEI index within our annual global engagement survey continued to reveal strong engagement scores across our ethnically diverse team members\n.\nThe leadership standards clearly articulate that all people leaders are expected to continuously develop their inclusive leadership acumen. Our Board, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Executive Committee are expected to, and do in fact, model high standards for DEI and are leading sustainable change through strong governance and oversight. We have also been committed to advancing transparency, by publicly disclosing further information and data on diversity, equity, and inclusion at HPE, including the Equal Employment Opportunity report data, since 2018.\nTalent\n- We invest heavily in an effort to attract, develop, and retain the best talent. We are committed to developing team members at all stages of their careers, and we do this by communicating a clear purpose and strategy; setting transparent goals; driving accountability; continuously assessing, developing, and advancing talent; and advancing a leadership-driven talent strategy. The dynamism of our industry and our company enables team members to grow in their current roles and build new skills. Over the past year, our approximately 62,000 team members completed over 820,700 online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories – leadership; inclusion and diversity; professional skills; technical; and compliance. HPE is deeply committed to identifying and developing the next generation of top-tier leadership with a special focus on diverse and technical talent. We conduct an in-depth annual talent and succession review with our CEO and Executive Committee members. The process focuses on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and advancing diversity representation for our most critical roles.\nPay Equity\n- We believe people should be paid equitably for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We maintain policies to promote equal pay, and we regularly review our global pay practices with an aim to pay team members in similar roles and locations commensurately with their experience and responsibilities. We partner with independent third-party experts to conduct annual pay assessments and identify unexplained gaps between our present state and our goal of equitable pay treatment for all team members. Where these reviews identify such gaps at a country-wide level, we adjust compensation to eliminate the gap. As a result of our efforts, our most recent pay equity review demonstrated that we have achieved pay parity for base compensation and bonus targets between male and female team\n3\nmembers in the U.S. (including among underrepresented ethnicities), U.K., and India, when accounting for job title, time-in-role, experience, and location. We conduct a number of compensation analyses in other countries to provide competitive and equitable pay and, where permissible, we intend to incorporate similar third-party pay assessments into our existing processes.\nWork That Fits Your Life\n-\nThis global initiative, which was launched in 2019, is an important example of how HPE is investing in our culture and creating a team member experience that aims to make HPE a destination of choice for the best talent in the industry. It includes an industry-leading paid parental leave program (minimum 6 months), part-time work opportunities for new parents or team members transitioning to retirement, and “Wellness Fridays” that allows team members a full Friday off four times per year to focus on their well-being. The HPE Global Wellness Program is a comprehensive program that promotes overall health and well-being by providing team members with programs and resources that offer flexibility built around team member needs while continuing to deliver on critical business results. The program consists of four pillars: physical health, financial well-being, mental and emotional health, and community well-being. Additionally, we offer a hybrid work environment for the majority of our team members, encouraging two days in the office per week for collaboration.\nTotal Rewards\n- HPE requires a uniquely talented workforce and is committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance based, designed to drive innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.\nBoard Oversight\n- Our Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management strategy and programs.\nOur HR and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our human resources and workforce management programs, including but not limited to those related to corporate culture; compensation plans and policies; diversity and inclusion; and talent acquisition, development, and retention.\nHPE’s strong and healthy culture is critical to accelerating what’s next for our customers and partners – and the success of our company. We believe that a workforce that is energized and more engaged will fuel our ability to pivot and grow, which will, in turn, power the next chapter at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nOur Business Segments, Products and Services\nOur operations are organized into six reportable business segments: Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services, and Corporate Investments and Other. The class of similar product categories within each segment which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue in each of the past three years was as follows:\n•\nFiscal 2023 - Compute products, Intelligent Edge products, HPC & AI products\n•\nFiscal 2022 - Compute products, Compute services, Intelligent Edge products\n•\nFiscal 2021 - Compute products, Compute services, Storage products\nThe Company has\none customer which represented 11% of the Company's total net revenue in fiscal 2023, primarily within the Intelligent Edge and Compute segments.\nA summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. A discussion of certain factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nCompute\nOur Compute portfolio consists of both general-purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload-optimized servers to deliver the best performance and value for demanding applications.

The HPE NonStop portfolio includes high-availability, fault-tolerant software and appliances that power applications, such as credit card transaction processing that require large scale and high availability. As part of our systems are aligned to the convergence of HPC and AI-at-scale across our industry, HPE offers a suite of software products, including AI-powered technologies designed to play a critical role in turning data into readily available, actionable information to fuel growth and innovation for our customers. Our solutions are focused on enabling customers to develop and deploy AI models, such as Large Language Models (“LLMs”) across training, tuning, and inferencing. These include a software stack needed to prepare data for AI models and then to train those AI models using our open-source machine learning platform.\nHPC & AI offerings also include operational and support services, whether sold with our systems or as standalone services. We also offer most of our solutions aaS through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, including HPE GreenLake for LLMs. With offerings that are AI-driven and built for hybrid cloud environments with HPE GreenLake consumption models, we provide the right workload optimized destinations for data and insights development for our customers.\nA portion of HPC & AI revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to the terms and rights for the convenience of the government entity. These terms and rights include in some instances a dependence on the appropriation of future funding and also termination rights contingent upon not achieving certain milestones. For a discussion of certain risks related to contracts with government entities, see “Risk Factors—Contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governments are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business” in Item 1A.\nStorage\nHPE Storage is transforming the customer experience with storage as-a-service and cloud data services through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and data infrastructure to enable customers to simplify IT and unlock greater levels of agility with a cloud operational experience. The customer experience transformation also includes AI and data-driven intelligence with HPE InfoSight and HPE CloudPhysics. Customers can store and serve their data with speed and high availability to applications, further secure and protect their data across hybrid clouds from ransomware and cyber threats, and gain data mobility across private cloud, public cloud, and multi-cloud environments.\nStorage provides data storage and data management offerings, which include cloud-native primary storage with the HPE Alletra Storage portfolio, self-service private cloud on-demand with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition; data storage and data management services with HPE GreenLake for Block Storage, and HPE GreenLake for File Storage; disaster recovery and ransomware recovery with Zerto; data protection services with HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery; and big data solutions running on the family of HPE Alletra 4000 Data Storage Servers.

FS also supports financial solutions for on-premise flexible consumption models, such as our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. In order to provide flexible services and capabilities that support the entire IT life cycle, FS partners with customers globally to help build investment strategies that enhance their business agility and support their business transformation. FS offers a wide selection of investment solution capabilities for large enterprise customers and channel partners, along with an array of financial options to SMBs and educational and governmental entities.\nCorporate Investments and Other\nCorporate Investments and Other includes the Advisory and Professional Services (“A & PS”) business, which primarily offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation services as well as complex solution engagement capabilities; the Communications and Media Solutions business (“CMS”), which primarily offers software and related services to the telecommunications industry and includes Athonet, which provides private mobile core networks to enterprises and communication services providers; the HPE Software business, which offers the HPE Ezmeral Software Container Platform and HPE Ezmeral Software Data Fabric; OpsRamp which provides a software-as-a-service platform for managed service providers and enterprise IT teams to monitor and manage their cloud and on-premises (“hybrid”) infrastructure; and Hewlett Packard Labs, which is responsible for research and development.\nSegment Realignments\nEffective November 1, 2023, in\norder to align our segment financial reporting more closely with our current business structure, we established a new reportable segment, Hybrid Cloud, which includes our historical Storage segment, HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions (which provides flexible as-a-service IT infrastructure through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and was previously reported under Compute and HPC & AI segments), Private Cloud, and Software (previously reported under Corporate Investments and Other segment). Additionally, certain products and services reported in the financial results for the HPC & AI segment through the end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Compute and Hybrid Cloud segments, and the recently acquired Athonet business and certain components of our CMS business reported in the financial results for Corporate Investments and Other through the end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Intelligent Edge segment. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will report our results under the realigned six reportable segments.\nOur Strengths\nWe believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including:\n•\nEdge-to-cloud strategy and solutions uniquely solve customer challenges.\nAs data grows and evolves and enterprises become increasingly distributed, HPE’s edge-to-cloud strategy is uniquely designed to enable customers to securely access, control, and maximize the value of all their workloads and data assets to accelerate business outcomes. The HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is an open, secure, fully integrated platform that brings a unified experience across the edge, data center, colocation, and cloud. It is automated and easy to consume with capacity available to scale up and down on demand. It offers true pay per use consumption so customers only pay for what they use, and they can have the entire hybrid cloud experience managed for them through our HPE Managed Services offerings.\n•\nComprehensive portfolio.\nWe have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and capabilities to help accelerate our customers' digital transformations. We combine our software-defined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a comprehensive IT strategy and connect our customers' data from edge to cloud, through our high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a single package, is one of our principal differentiators.\n•\nDifferentiated consumption-based IT solutions for a growing opportunity.\nEnterprises of all sizes are looking to digitally transform in order to develop next-generation cloud-native applications, create actionable insights from their data, and drive business growth, but they face many challenges including lack of in-house IT skills, limited budgets and options for financing, and lack of flexibility to choose the technology foundation that best meets their needs. Consumption-based IT offers solutions to these challenges by providing greater agility, which empowers people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation by leveraging insights from their data, while also eliminating\n6\ncapital and operating expenses tied to infrastructure over-provisioning. HPE is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumption-based IT experience.\n•\nOpen platforms.\nThe world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of centers of data everywhere, which are highly decentralized and distributed. This shift demands a unified cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to customers’ data sources to create real-time insights everywhere. We believe the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all our customers' clouds, rather than requiring customers to be locked into a cloud stack.\n•\nMulti-year innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet.\nWe have been in the technology and innovation business for over 80 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments such as cloud, artificial intelligence, supercomputing, and cybersecurity to drive business transformations now and in the future. We also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provide the financial flexibility and speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.\n•\nGlobal distribution and partner ecosystem.\nWe are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor, and/or multi-language environments. We have one of the largest go-to-market capabilities in our industry, including a large ecosystem of channel partners, which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform provides open cloud application programming interfaces to our partners, enabling them to better offer their unique solutions to customers.\n•\nCustom financial solutions.\nThrough our FS segment, we help customers create investment capacity to accelerate their transformations by helping them free up capital, capture value from older assets, achieve sustainability goals, invest in new technologies as-a-service, and weather financial volatility. FS is also an enabler of our consumption-based IT models by helping spread our upfront solution costs over the duration of the customer contract. Through Financial Services' Technology Renewal Centers, we are helping customers achieve their own sustainability goals by recovering over 3 million IT assets in fiscal 2022 and refurbishing more than 82% for reuse.\n•\nExperienced leadership team.\nOur management team has an extensive track record of performance and execution. We are led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Antonio Neri, who has proven experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands, and driving sustained growth and expansion in the technology industry. Mr. Neri's experience includes more than 25 years combined at HPE and Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP Co.”) in various leadership positions. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise IT business and the markets in which we compete.\nSales, Marketing, and Distribution\nWe manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners, including:\n•\nresellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups;\n•\ndistribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;\n•\noriginal equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that integrate our products and services with their own products and services, and sell the integrated solution;\n•\nindependent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products;\n•\nsystems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and\n•\nadvisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services.\nThe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing, and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. This has resulted in a combined go-to-market model, in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries, while we sell and deliver our products, solutions, and services through a channel-only model in the remaining countries. In those countries where we have a direct sales presence, we follow a bifurcated sales operational model with separate go-to-market routes for high-velocity, transactional hardware sales, on the one hand and\n7\nfor services and solutions, on the other hand. Also, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers, our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts, both in the commercial and public sector space.\nManufacturing and Materials\nWe utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design. The use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand. In addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.\nHistorically, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.\nWe purchase materials, supplies, and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on single-source suppliers for certain customized parts (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption) and a disruption or loss of a single-source supplier could delay production of some products. In some instances, our single-source suppliers (e.g., Intel and AMD as suppliers of certain x86 processors) are also the single-source suppliers for the entire market; disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors.\nLike other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin, but does not generally disrupt production. We also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints, or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price, and availability of supply. See “Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly” in Item 1A.\nAs a result of the pandemic, worldwide demand for electronic components spiked in many different technology sectors, causing industry-wide shortages for many electronic components. While availability for many components is now recovering, some shortages are nevertheless anticipated to persist, primarily as a result of new demand for certain components arising in more diverse sectors without corresponding capacity investments by suppliers to meet the new demand. We continue to rely on proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position ourselves well for availability of those components. We intend to take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand, and plan to continue leveraging strong partnerships and long-term agreements with our suppliers.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period.\nThe global pandemic resulted in an unprecedented demand for electronic devices, which, coupled with related industry-wide supply constraints and inflationary pressures, led to a challenging supply chain environment. Additionally, the lasting effects of the pandemic continued to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics environment. The elevated order book levels we experienced in fiscal 2022 have generally been declining throughout fiscal 2023, as supply chain constraints eased (though challenges still remain) and demand softened unevenly across our portfolio (as a result of improving supply chain dynamics and as customers have been digesting their prior larger orders). Mild improvements to industry-wide supply constraints have helped to ease certain supply chain challenges we encountered in the recent past, including the increased availability of supply and lower material and logistics costs. Material cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-user demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to evolve and ultimately impact the translation of the cost\n8\nenvironment to our pricing actions and, consequently, our operating results. Logistics costs continued to decrease from previously elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the freight network.\nInternational\nOur products and services are available worldwide. We believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products.\nA summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. Approximately 64% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2023 came from sales outside the United States.\nFor a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see “Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition,” and “Risk Factors—We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” in Item 1A of Part I, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” in Item 7A of Part II, and Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nResearch and Development\nInnovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts (“R&D”) are focused on designing and developing products, services, and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.\nExpenditures for R&D were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and\n$2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products, services, and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position.\nIncluded in the R&D work currently taking place at the Company are the following initiatives:\nIn Compute, we are developing high quality next-generation compute solutions (servers, server attached options, and software) that integrate the latest industry technology, which coupled with other innovations from HPE are aligned to the requirements of our customers. In the area of software-as-a-service, we are developing cloud-native, cloud-based server management solutions to complement our existing portfolio.\nIn HPC & AI, our R&D investments are focused on developing new technology in high-performance networking, liquid cooling, artificial intelligence platforms and its application to LLMs, scalable memory systems, and high-performance storage and data solutions that underpin our differentiated offerings. We also develop high-performance computing and artificial intelligence developer tools and software, cloud-native and scalable cluster management software, and transaction processing software. These R&D efforts are critical to our competitive advantage and enabled our successful delivery of the first exascale supercomputer in the world. HPC & AI also collaborates with an applied research group, Hewlett Packard Labs, where we invest in long-term technological advancements, including artificial intelligence software, advanced systems architectures, networking, and photonics. We also collaborate with government and commercial research institutions and co-invest in many of these areas. The work of Hewlett Packard Labs contributes to a pipeline of technologies we consider for future commercialization, including quantum computing and its relation to high performance computing. All our products are being developed to be delivered in a consumption model, including integration into our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, such as the HPE GreenLake for LLMs offering.\nIn the Storage and data management domains, we continue to evolve the portfolio to bring the cloud operational experience to customers across their hybrid cloud deployment. HPE is focused on helping customers simplify how they manage storage and protect their data and workloads on-premises, at the edge, and in the public cloud. By leveraging the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform for unified cloud-based management, we have transformed the way customers consume and manage storage, while offering robust data protection and private cloud solutions. In fiscal 2023, we have expanded our storage portfolio to offer software-defined disaggregated storage services that include HPE GreenLake for Block Storage and HPE GreenLake for File Storage. With an increased emphasis on simplifying day-to-day management and cloud data protection, HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition delivers unified virtual machine-to-infrastructure management for both on-\n9\npremises and public cloud environments. With the addition of HPE GreenLake for Disaster Recovery alongside HPE GreenLake for Backup and Recovery, customers have access to a complete suite of offerings providing cloud data protection.\nIn Intelligent Edge, we are investing in a broad portfolio of networking and security capabilities, addressing remote-user, branch, campus, data-center, and cloud use-cases. We are expanding our wireless access portfolio to include 4G, LTE, and 5G cellular to complement our leadership position in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, with an emphasis on hybrid deployments. We have expanded our security investments with the recent acquisition of Security Service Edge provider Axis Security and are integrating security with our software-defined wide area network (“SD-WAN”) capabilities to deliver a single vendor Secure Access Services Edge solution. Within our Ethernet Switch portfolio, we are investing in new Data Center Networking platforms and features to expand our total addressable market within our core market.\nWe are leveraging the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform to provide consistent access to our aaS capabilities and to enable new network-as-a-service business models. We are also investing in automation, machine learning, and AI-based network operations to optimize user experience and improve operator efficiency, as exemplified by our cloud-native Aruba Central cloud service that provides manageability for our entire portfolio, including Wireless LAN, Campus & Data Center Switches, and SD-Branch.\nIn Hewlett Packard Labs, in addition to the aforementioned HPC & AI-related work, we are focused on disruptive innovation and applied research in collaboration with other HPE business groups to deliver differentiated intellectual property. Our innovation agenda is focused on developing technologies in the areas of system architecture, networking, AI, accelerators, quantum computing, silicon photonics, and sustainability. We also continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the development and delivery of our technology.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to our R&D activities, see “Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including our ongoing transition to an aaS consumption-based business model, our business, and financial performance may suffer” in Item 1A.\nPatents\nOur general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. As of October 31, 2023, our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13,000 issued and pending patents.\nPatents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments.\nIn addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see “Risk Factors—Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend” and “—Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties” in Item 1A.\nSeasonality\nFrom time to time, the markets in which we sell our products, services, and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See “Risk Factors—Our uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable” in Item 1A.\nCompetition\nWe have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products, solutions, and services which includes our as-a-service offerings. We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, and the availability of our IT infrastructure offerings.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are relatively short, and to\n10\nremain competitive we must develop new products and services, continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture, and market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.\nThe competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below:\nCompute\nand\nStorage\nbusinesses operate in the highly competitive enterprise data center infrastructure market, which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors are technology vendors, such as Dell Technologies Inc., Super Micro Computer, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), and NetApp Inc. In certain regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or “white-box” manufacturers. Our strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services, and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software, and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.\nHPC & AI\npredominantly operates in the market for data-intensive super-computing, analytics, and artificial intelligence. Our primary competitors are compute technology vendors that can design and build solutions that deliver performance scalability and connectivity necessary to handle super-compute and AI workloads, including Dell Technologies Inc., Super Micro Computer, Inc,, Lenovo Group Ltd., IBM, Fujitsu Network Communications, Inc., and Atos Information Technology Incorporated. In our software platform for AI model development and deployment, we both compete and cooperate with cloud service providers and start-up companies that deliver platforms for AI model training, tuning, and inferencing.  Similar to the compute space, our strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services, and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software, and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our deep expertise and capabilities designing and delivering these solutions, broad end-to-end heterogeneous and open solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.\nIntelligent Edge\noperates in the highly competitive networking and connectivity infrastructure market, which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors are technology vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Arista Networks Inc, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and Juniper Networks, Inc. Our strategy is to deliver superior enterprise wired and wireless local-area networking components and software, high-value technology support services, and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software, and services capabilities. Our competitive advantage includes our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.\nFinancial Services.\nIn our financing business, our primary competitors are captive financing companies, such as IBM Global Financing, Dell Financial Services, and Cisco Capital, as well as banks and other financial institutions. Our primary IT Asset Disposition (“ITAD”) competitors are ERI, Ingram Micro, Sage Sustainable Electronics, and Sims Recycling Solutions. We believe our competitive advantage over banks, other financial institutions, and ITAD providers is our ability to bring together our investment solutions with our expertise in managing technology assets. Not only are we able to deliver investment solutions that help customers create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs, but we also help them extract value from existing IT investments while more efficiently managing the retirement of those assets. All of these solutions can help customers accelerate digital transformation, create new budget streams, and meet Circular Economy objectives.\nFor a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see “Risk Factors—We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance” in Item 1A.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nLiving Progress -\nLiving Progress is our business strategy for creating sustainable IT solutions that meet the technology demands of the future, while advancing the way people live and work. This strategy underpins our commitment to the environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors most important to stakeholders. Our edge-to-cloud strategy helps our customers transform and digitize their business while reducing the environmental footprint of HPE and our customers. A legacy of ESG leadership increases our competitiveness and differentiates us in the marketplace by helping our customers achieve not only their business objectives, but also their sustainability goals. The HPE Board of Directors, including through its committees, provides oversight of our ESG strategy, risks, practices, policies, and disclosures, to support integration with our core business strategy.\nSustainable Value Creation\n- Sustainability performance is a core business discipline within HPE. Our Living Progress strategy and sustainability programs are key to our lasting relationships with our customers, and our sustainability credentials\n11\nprovide us with a competitive advantage in the market, support talent acquisition and retention, and enable ongoing access to global markets.\nHPE has committed to becoming a net-zero enterprise by 2040, with intermediate targets set across our value chain for 2030. These climate targets are approved by the Science Based Target initiative and align with the latest climate science. Our commitment is supported by our Net-Zero Roadmap, which defines the levers we plan to prioritize to enable us to deliver on our near- and long-term carbon emissions reduction targets and outlines key assumptions with respect to our reduction targets.\nIn 2023, the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) resulted from our customers' use of our products and solutions. We recognize the opportunity to innovate technologies for a carbon-constrained world and are committed to delivering products and services that empower our customers to reduce the carbon footprints of their IT estates while also gaining maximum productivity from their IT investments and reducing costs. For instance, in 2023, HPE launched a portfolio of new and enhanced sustainable IT services to enable IT to run more sustainably from the data center to the workload.\nTo enable market access across the globe and aid customers in selecting more sustainable IT solutions, many of our products are certified by eco-labels such as Electronic Product Environment Assessment Tool, TCO Certified, Energy STAR, China SEPA and the China Energy Conservation Program.\nSupply Chain Responsibility and Human Rights\nWe manage our supply chain to help reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and improve overall performance and value creation for our customers, partners, and suppliers. Building upon the successful launch of our supply chain data management software, we have granted access to suppliers representing 80% by production spend to visualize their company-specific emissions data and the ability to track progress toward their publicly stated emissions reduction goals. In 2023, we participated in the Responsible Business Alliance pilot of an Environmental Management Tool (“EMT”) to request primary GHG emissions data from a small number of our suppliers using third-party software. The EMT enables all suppliers to disclose their GHG emissions, reduction targets, and reporting and verification statuses to their customers in a consolidated, industry-standard survey, increasing ESG transparency, maturity, and data availability.\nWe are conscious of the importance of the responsible use of our products. In an effort to prevent intended and unintended harm, we continue to consider who purchases our offerings and how they are used by, among other things, limiting features, including responsible use clauses, monitoring for risk of alternate end uses, and promoting deployment of AI with safeguards, such as user training and ongoing checks and refinement to mitigate bias and improve accuracy.\nOur commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion extends beyond our workforce and to our suppliers, as well. We believe a diverse supply chain and equity in sourcing not only creates opportunities for underrepresented and underserved communities, but also contributes to the resiliency of our supply chain and of our communities.\nHuman rights principles are embedded in how we do business, and we are committed to holding our entire value chain to high ethical standards that respect such principles. We have processes in place to enable the early detection of forced labor and have implemented due diligence procedures to monitor and help prevent human rights violations or abuses at our suppliers and in our operations. Additionally, through our Responsible Minerals Program, we work to advance the responsible sourcing of minerals used in our products and within our supply chain.\nWe are also committed to the responsible and ethical development and deployment of new technologies to advance how we live and work, and we continue to build on our existing responsible development work, particularly in relation to AI. We have an executive level AI Ethics Responsibility Committee and an operational AI Ethics Working Group, through which we aim to align the development, deployment, and use of AI with HPE's AI Ethical Principles, promoting privacy-enabled and secure, human focused, inclusive, robust, and responsible use of AI.\nIn 2022, we refined our approach to assessing ethical AI and rolled out AI Ethical Principles training. In 2023, we further advanced this initiative by launching three new sub-committees to help us operationalize our principles for: Products (AI we develop), Processes (AI we source to use), and Partnerships (AI we source to incorporate into our solutions).\nWhile the HPE Board of Directors and all of its committees take an integrated, rather than siloed, approach to providing oversight of ESG matters, including environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, and human rights, our Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of our broader ESG strategy, initiatives, risks, policies, and disclosures.\nMaterial Government Regulations\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are\n12\npresently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that global trade and certain environmental regulations could potentially materially impact our business.\nEnvironment\nOur products and operations are, or may in the future be, subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including, among others, laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment and emissions-related reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites; product compliance and safety, such as repairability, chemical composition, packaging and labeling; energy consumption of our products and services; and the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances. We proactively evaluate, and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into account, among other things, published lists of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to human health or the environment.  We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain repairability requirements or financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as “product take-back legislation”). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, reusing or recycling. Finally, as climate change and other environmental-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. In the event our products are impacted by these laws or standards, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions or from being procured by certain governments or private companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and other environmental-related issues, and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and treaties. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental and environmental-related laws applicable to our operations, products and services, and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We support this commitment with a range of comprehensive policies, including relating to environmental, health and safety, climate, water, and electronic waste; a strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services; an extensive supply chain responsibility program; and an approach to ethical standards and strong governance that are the foundations of our business.\nGlobal Trade\nAs a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world. Such laws, rules, and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or the need to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally. We continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that will continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements.\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact us, see “Regulatory and Government Risks” within “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.\nAdditional Information\nItanium is a trademark of Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries.\n13\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following are our current executive officers:\nAntonio Neri; President and Chief Executive Officer\nMr. Neri has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since June 2017 and February 2018, respectively.

    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nIf we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, including our ongoing transition to an aaS consumption-based business model, our business, operating results, and financial performance may suffer.\nOur long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware, software, and services as we deliver global edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data, everywhere. We continue our transition to an aaS company, to provide our entire portfolio through a range of subscription and consumption-based, pay-per-use, and aaS offerings. We will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and license-based model, giving our customers choices in consuming HPE products and services. To successfully execute this strategy and transition, we must continue to improve cost structure, align sales coverage with strategic goals, improve channel execution and strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as edge computing, hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, data center networking, network security and high-performance compute. We must make sufficient long-term investments in strategic growth areas, such as developing, obtaining, and protecting appropriate intellectual property and committing significant R&D and other resources before knowing whether our projections will reasonably reflect customer demand for our solutions. Should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights, or our offerings not perform as designed or promised, we may be unable to manage or complete the transition successfully or in a timely manner, not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transition (even if we complete it), and our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Furthermore, such incremental capital requirements may negatively impact cash flows in the near term, and may require us to dedicate additional resources, including sales and marketing costs.\nThe process of improving our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform’s aaS solutions and enhancing existing hardware, software, and cloud-based solutions is complex, costly, and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately, to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, or to otherwise successfully execute this strategy could significantly harm our market share, results of operations, and financial performance. Having developed a cloud platform product in HPE GreenLake, we must be able to continue to scale quickly, while also managing costs and preserving margins, which means accurately forecasting volumes, mixes of products, and configurations that meet customer requirements, which we may not succeed at doing. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform faces competition from peer companies with their own cloud platform offerings, and any delay in the development, production, or marketing of a new product, service or solution, including new features of the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, could result in our offerings being late to reach the market, which could further harm our competitive position. Furthermore, we anticipate needing to continually adapt our go-to-market structure with new sales and marketing approaches, to better align with the software consumption-based business model. Changing our go-to-market structure may affect employee compensation models and ultimately our ability to retain employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from them.\nThese solutions generally are multiyear agreements, which result in recurring revenue streams over the term of the arrangement. As customer demand for our software consumption-based offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery) and our aaS offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement). As such, our financial results and growth depend, in part, on customers continuing to purchase our services and solutions over the contract life on the agreed terms. Additionally, transition to this business model also means that our historical results, especially those from before the transition, may not be indicative of future results, which may adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results. Further, these contracts allow customers to take actions, such as requesting rate reductions, reducing the use of our services and solutions or terminating a contract early, which may adversely affect our recurring revenue and profitability. Further, our software consumption offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of services as well as operational, technical, legal or other costs.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly.\nOur operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products, and services, as well as our suppliers’ abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products, and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide variety of solutions that we\n17\noffer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble, and deliver certain solutions, problems have, from time to time in the past, arisen, and could in the future arise, in production, planning, and inventory management that could harm our business. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers have at times decided, and may in the future decide, to discontinue conducting business with us. Other supplier problems that we have faced, and could again face in the future, include component shortages, excess supply, and contractual, relational, and labor risks, each of which is described below.\n•\nComponent shortages\n. We have been experiencing delays and shortages of certain components as a result of strong demand and capacity constraints caused by insufficient capacity to meet unanticipated demand from emerging markets, and other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. Though we have seen easing of industry-wide supply constraints, we expect discreet constraints to continue, the duration of which remains uncertain. In the past, we have experienced shortages or delays, which led to higher prices of certain components and exposure to quality issues and delivery delays, which may occur again in the future. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices, of acceptable quality, or at all, to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business and financial performance could suffer from a loss of time-sensitive sales, additional freight costs incurred, or the inability to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we may have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.\n•\nExcess supply\n. In order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements, non-cancellable commitments, or other inventory management arrangements with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which has at times adversely impacted and could in the future adversely impact our business and financial performance.\n•\nContractual terms\n. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur charges relating to inventory obsolescence.\n•\nContingent workers\n. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. Our ability to manage the size and cost of our contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.\n•\nSingle-source suppliers\n. We obtain certain components from single-source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality, scale, or customization needs. Certain of such suppliers have, in the past decided, and may in the future decide, to discontinue manufacturing components used in our products, which may cause us to discontinue certain products, incur additional costs to redesign our products so as not to incorporate such discontinued components, or incur time and expense to find replacement suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier has at times delayed, and could delay, production of some products as replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations. For some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity, and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nSystem security risks, data protection incidents, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price.\nAs a leading technology firm, we are exposed to attacks from criminals, nation state actors, malicious insiders, and activist hackers (collectively, “malicious parties”) who have at times been able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures. Although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information, so far, these attacks have not resulted in material impacts to HPE, nor have any of HPE’s consumers, customers, or employees informed HPE that these\n18\nattacks resulted in material harm to them. It is possible that future attacks may result in material misappropriation, system disruptions or shutdowns, malicious alteration, or destruction of our confidential or personal information or that of third parties. Further, there has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of such attacks, and we expect these activities to continue to increase. Malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, including within our cloud-based environments and offerings. Further, cyber-attacks or incidents have in the past gone, and could in the future go, undetected in our environments for a period of time. Given our broad and diverse network environment, resource limitations, and operational constraints, we have in the past failed, and may in the future fail, to patch certain security vulnerabilities in time to prevent successful disruptions of our infrastructure or expose information. Malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain and the systems or networks of other third parties on whom we rely, and as such, may embed malicious software or hardware in our products, thereby compromising our customers. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas, may create a heightened risk of such cyberattacks or exacerbate system vulnerabilities, considering our continued hybrid work environment. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs associated with cybersecurity tools and infrastructure and fierce competition for scarce cybersecurity and IT talent have at times limited, and may in the future limit, our ability to efficiently identify, eliminate, or remediate cyber or other security vulnerabilities or problems or enact changes to minimize the attack surface of our network. Furthermore, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Additional impacts from cybersecurity incidents could include remediation costs to our customers, suppliers, or distributors, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives for continued business; lost revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract business partners following an incident; increased insurance premiums; and damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information, intellectual property, and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our business may process, store, and transmit customer data, including commercially sensitive and personal data, subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other privacy laws and regulations related to the handling of personal data. With our business increasingly providing aaS offerings, malicious parties could target such services, potentially resulting in an increased risk of compromise of customer data and regulatory exposure. Incidents involving our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information, intellectual property, or sensitive, confidential, or personal data about us, our clients, or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information; result in regulatory fines, litigation, and potential liability for us; damage our brand and reputation; or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other IT solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nAdditionally, we have at times experienced, and may experience, other security issues that are not results of any action or attack from malicious parties, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. Portions of our IT infrastructure also have experienced, and may experience, interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive, and resource intensive. Furthermore, our data centers depend on predictable and reliable energy and networking capabilities, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected or disrupted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to the effects of climate change. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers resulting from these events could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our reputation and stock price.\nWhile we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our products, services, IT systems, controls, and software that could be exploited by any malicious parties, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we have at times failed, and may fail, to anticipate, detect, identify, and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are exploited. There is no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material in the aggregate at a future date even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human-induced disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme weather conditions; power or\n19\nwater shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity and price volatility; terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and health epidemics or pandemics. The impacts and frequency of any of the above could be further exacerbated by climate change, particularly in countries where we operate that have limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources. While we are predominantly self-insured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events, the occurrence of business disruptions could, among other impacts, harm our revenue, profitability, and financial condition; adversely affect our competitive position; increase our costs and expenses; make it difficult or impossible to provide our offerings to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers; create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain; or require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\nPublic health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures taken in response to such events have in the past negatively impacted, and may again in the future negatively impact, our operations and workforce, as well as those of our partners, customers and suppliers. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of such events have, from time to time, caused increased volatility in financial and other capital markets, adversely impacting our stock price, our ability to access the capital markets, and our ability to fund liquidity needs, and may do so again in the future. The negative impacts of any such events on business operations and demand for our offerings will depend on future developments and actions taken in response to such events, which may be outside our control, highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted at this time.\nThe manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the United States, Puerto Rico, Czech Republic, Mexico, China, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to HPE’s distribution channels and customers. Other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics, or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including those enumerated above, as they have been in the past by natural disasters and public health issues in the United States, Puerto Rico, and China.  To the extent such disruptions adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Item 1A of Part I of this Form 10-K.\nAny failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.\nAs part of our strategy, we may acquire businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business (collectively, “business combination and investment transactions”), and also handle any post-closing issues, such as integration. For example, among other acquisitions and subsequent integrations, in June 2023, we acquired Athonet, a private cellular network technology provider, in May 2023, we acquired OpsRamp, Inc., an IT operations management company, in March 2023, we acquired Axis Security, a cloud security provider, in September 2020, we acquired Silver Peak Systems, Inc., an SD-WAN industry leader and in September 2019, we acquired Cray Inc., a global supercomputer leader. In April 2017 and September 2017, we spun off our Enterprise Services and Software businesses, respectively. See also the risk factors below under the heading “Risks Related to Prior Separations.”\nRisks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial results, including our effective tax rate:\n•\nWe may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, which may result in (1) failure to retain employees, customers, distributors, and suppliers; (2) increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations; and (3) significant increase in costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.\n•\nOur ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives. We may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs, timing and other matters.\n•\nIn order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements, which could affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n•\nFor an acquisition or other combination, the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls, which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business.\n20\n•\nBusiness combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nWe have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\n•\nFor a divestiture, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated.\n•\nThe impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected, as we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected. If we do not satisfy pre-closing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, it may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise if our Board of Directors deems it to be undesirable. Provisions such as indemnification, meeting requirements, and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests, or changes in control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nManagement’s attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment transactions and further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives.\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nWe use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including both direct and indirect sales to end-users. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nOur financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement. Moreover, some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation, and market trends. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors’ financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.\nOur inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors have in the past adjusted orders during periods of product shortages, and may do so in the future, in addition to cancelling orders if their inventory is too high or delaying orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing, and IT support positions. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. These are particularly important considering our recent segment realignment, as we shift our growth strategy to capture the market opportunity presented by hybrid cloud. Certain equity-based incentive awards for certain executives contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-\n21\nterm financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened.\nOur failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations and our ability to execute our strategy. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As competition for highly skilled employees in our industry has grown increasingly intense, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, higher than anticipated levels of employee attrition, which has resulted in increased costs to hire new employees with the desired skills and may do so again in the future. In addition, significant or prolonged turnover or revised hiring priorities may negatively impact our operations and culture, as well as our ability to successfully maintain our processes and procedures, including due to the loss of historical, technical, and other expertise.  These risks to attracting and retaining the necessary talent may be exacerbated by recent labor constraints and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits.\nFailure to meet ESG expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nThere has been an increased focus from regulators and stakeholders on ESG matters. Given our commitment to ESG, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations, are based on available data and estimates, and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Initiatives to address such ESG issues may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to manage these issues and accomplish our goals, commitments, and targets present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which may be outside of our control or could have adverse impacts on our business, including on our stock price. Further, there is uncertainty around the accounting standards and climate-related disclosures associated with emerging laws and reporting requirements and the related costs to comply with the emerging regulations.\nOur failure or perceived failure to achieve our ESG goals, maintain ESG practices, or comply with emerging ESG regulations that meet evolving regulatory or stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. Our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our stakeholders have about our action or inaction on certain ESG-related issues, or because they may disagree with our goals and initiatives. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial performance, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIssues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm or liability.\nWe currently incorporate AI capabilities into certain of our offerings, and our research into and continued development of such capabilities remain ongoing. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience competitive, brand, or reputational harm or legal and/or regulatory action. Further, incorporating AI gives rise to litigation risk and risk of non-compliance and unknown cost of compliance, as AI is an emerging technology for which the legal and regulatory landscape is not fully developed (including potential liability for breaching intellectual property or privacy rights or laws). While new AI initiatives, laws, and regulations are emerging and evolving, what they ultimately will look like remains uncertain, and our obligation to comply with them could entail significant costs, negatively affect our business, or entirely limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings.\nAdditionally, leveraging AI capabilities to potentially improve internal functions and operations presents further risks and challenges. While we aim to use AI ethically and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical or legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. The use of AI to support business operations carries inherent risks related to data privacy and security, such as intended, unintended, or inadvertent transmission of proprietary or sensitive information, as well as challenges related to implementing and maintaining AI tools, such as developing and maintaining appropriate datasets for such support. Further, dependence on AI without adequate safeguards to make certain\n22\nbusiness decisions may introduce additional operational vulnerabilities by impacting our relationships with customers, partners, and suppliers; by producing inaccurate outcomes based on flaws in the underlying data; or other unintended results.\nRisks arising from climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may impact our business\nClimate change serves as a risk multiplier that could increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations and those of suppliers and customers. Our corporate headquarters is located in Spring, Texas, which suffers from floods, hurricanes, and other extreme weather, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires, each affecting the health and safety of our employees. In California, to mitigate wildfire risk, electric utilities have, at times periodically deployed, and may in the future, periodically deploy public safety power shutoffs, which affect electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities. Certain sites located in the United States, Middle East, China, and India experience exposure to extreme heat and water stress, which could potentially jeopardize the health and well-being of our employees, consequently impacting our operations. While we seek to mitigate the business risks associated with climate change through site selection, infrastructure technological investments and robust environmental programs, this may require us to incur substantial costs, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so as there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters.\nThe increasing concern over climate change could also result in transition risks, such as shifting customer preferences or compliance risks from changing regulatory and legal requirements. Changing customer preferences may result in increased demands for sustainable solutions, products, and services, which may cause us to incur additional costs, invest more in R&D, or make other changes to other operations to respond to such demands, which could adversely affect our financial results. We may also confront higher electricity prices as the grid decarbonizes, and higher costs for supplies or components that comply with certain environmental regulatory thresholds, potentially impacting our margins or the pricing of our offerings. If we fail to manage these and other transition risks in an effective manner, customer demand for our solutions, products, and services could diminish, and our profitability could suffer.\nIf we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business, and financial performance may suffer.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, services, and solutions, including defects in our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products, services, and solutions that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or “patch”) to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement, and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.\nOur ability to implement solutions for our customers, anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology (such as cloud-, AI-, and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving), and develop new service offerings or incorporate technological improvements into our offerings that meet current and prospective customers’ needs, as well as evolving industry standards, is critical to our competitiveness and success. We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, portfolio of products, ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, and security of our offerings. If our products, services, support, and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed.\n23\nWe have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel, and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against theirs. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies, successfully adapt to industry developments and changing demand, and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve, we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous, and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.\nCompanies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with vertical partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face aggressive price competition and may continue to do so. As a consequence of inflation and higher supply chain and manufacturing costs, we have in the past increased the prices of many of our products and services to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin, and may do so again in the future. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.\nBecause our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products and services, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on R&D than some of our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from R&D expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.\nEven if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards software defined and public cloud, which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products.\nInternational Risks\nDue to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition.\nOur business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware, software, and services in, and continued access to, the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty and constrained spending on network and enterprise infrastructure have in the past adversely affected the demand for our products, services, and solutions. These have resulted in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and made it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows, and expenses, and may have such effects again in the future. Such factors, including how long such conditions may persist, among others, may negatively impact the evenness or volume of demand for our products and services, potentially resulting in impacts similar to those mentioned above, though the precise extent of such impacts cannot be accurately predicted.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. Interest and other expenses have varied, and could continue to vary, materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. For example, in response to increasing inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with central banks around the world, have been raising interest rates, signaled expectations of additional rate increases, and have indicated these rates may remain higher for longer. It is difficult to predict the impact of such events on us, our third-party partners, our customers, or economic markets more broadly, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Such\n24\nactions have impacted, and may further impact our ability, desire, or the timing of seeking funding for various investment opportunities. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Further, reduced U.S. federal government spending may limit demand for our products, services, and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products, services, and solutions.\nOur business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policy, U.S. export controls and sanctions, and U.S. regulations concerning imports, as well as international laws and regulations relating to global trade. Current U.S. government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign goods, including information and communication technology products. These measures have materially increased costs for certain goods imported into the United States. As a result, our business has in the past been impacted by forced material price increases, which in turn resulted in price increases for our offerings, which subsequently limited demand or reduced margins for our offerings, all of which may impact us again from time to time in the future. Additionally, U.S. trading partners may adopt their own trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. Similarly, changes in regulations relating to exports could prevent us from exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely. In addition, changes in requirements relating to making foreign direct investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions.\nSales outside the United States constituted approximately 64% of our net revenue in fiscal 2023. As such, our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors in addition to those otherwise already disclosed, including:\n•\nongoing uncertainties as a result of instability or changes in geopolitical conditions, including military or political conflicts, such as those caused by the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Hamas (the potential escalation or geographic expansion of which could heighten other risks identified in this report), or the relationship between China and the U.S. (which could, among other things, impact the enforceability of certain contracts or the timing and form of certain payments);\n•\ninflationary pressures, such as those the market is currently experiencing, which have increased, and may continue to increase, costs for materials, supplies, and services;\n•\nadverse or uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including a rising interest rate environment and fears of a potential global economic downturn or recession, which have at times in the past slowed customer demand for our products and services, and may do so again in the future;\n•\nnetwork security, privacy, and data sovereignty concerns, which could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies;\n•\nlonger collection cycles and financial instability among customers, which could impact our ability to collect on accounts receivable and consequently recognize revenue;\n•\nlocal labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs, or changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent;\n•\nmanaging our geographically dispersed workforce, which has necessitated, and may in the future require, incurring costs to promote seamless workforce connectivity and to comply with changing laws, regulations and workers’ rights councils across multiple jurisdictions;\n•\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements, which have required us to incur additional development and production costs to modify or adapt our offerings, and may do so again in the future;\n•\nlocal content and manufacturing requirements, which have impacted, and could further impact, our ability to sell into those markets;\n•\ndifficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries, and changes in tax laws, which introduces uncertainty to our results of operations and financial performance; and\n•\nfluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments, which have from time to time adversely impacted, and any of which could in the future adversely impact, our results of operations and ability to meet customer demand.\nCertain of the factors described above have, in the past, disrupted the operations of, and adversely impacted our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers, customers, or vendors located outside of the United States, and could do so again in the future. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture, the operations of whom are subject to local labor laws and other requirements. Any loss of or limitations on their output or their inability to operate\n25\ncould have an adverse effect on our ability to timely deliver our products and services, which would in turn negatively impact our financial performance.\nFurther, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the trade sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union (the “EU”), and other countries in response have negatively impacted business and financial performance in that region. HPE is proceeding with the exit of our remaining business in Russia and Belarus as planned; however, we cannot provide any assurance that such exit will be efficient or uninterrupted, which may negatively impact our operational expenses.\nWe implement policies, procedures, and training designed to facilitate compliance with anti-corruption laws around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. But in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, people may engage in business practices prohibited by anti-corruption laws. Our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies, and those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen, and British pound have, from time to time, adversely impacted, and could in the future, have an adverse impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have, from time to time, adversely affected, and could in future periods adversely affect our revenue recognition and our revenue growth. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect our ability to implement price increases, margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.\nFrom time to time, we use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks, and may continue to do so in the future. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license, or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.\nWe rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide, or otherwise use in our operations. However, from time to time our intellectual property rights have been challenged, infringed, or circumvented, and any of such rights could be further challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position.\nOur products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.\nMuch of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future versions of our products, our relationship with the third party may deteriorate or cease, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or\n26\nrefuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in our industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.\nThird parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of extracting infringement settlements. If we cannot license, or replace, allegedly infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, discontinue certain product offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing, or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.\nFinancial Risks\nAdverse developments affecting our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs, and access to capital markets could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings, any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper, or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. Additionally, increased borrowing costs, including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, and access to capital markets.\nIn addition, volatility and disruption in the financial sector and capital markets and other events negatively affecting macroeconomic conditions or contributing to the instability or volatility thereof, such as rising interest rates, have from time to time in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our liquidity, capital position, and access to capital markets. Our total liquidity depends in part on the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility and our other financing agreements. The failure of any lender's ability to fund future draws on our revolving credit facility or our other financing arrangements could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional capital for future needs. The future effects of such events are unknown and difficult to predict at this time, and could adversely affect us, our customers, financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or others with which we do business, which may in turn have adverse impacts on our current and/or projected business operations, financial condition, and our results of operations.\nOur debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends.\nIn addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments; making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations; increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock.\nRecent quantitative tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, have affected, and may continue to affect, our short-term ability to incur debt at reasonable prices, or our desire to incur debt at all. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.\nThe revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.\nOur revenue, gross margin, and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups, and geographic markets and therefore, will likely be different in future periods than our historical results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services, which is difficult to accurately predict, varies from time to time, and may be uneven\n27\nacross our portfolio of offerings. Additionally, customer acceptances of delivered orders and the timing thereof can be uneven across our portfolio and can impact our ability to recognize revenue. Such variables have in the past negatively impacted our financial performance, and may do so again in the future. Delays or reductions in IT spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer, and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue.\nFurthermore, the relationship between China and the U.S., and any subsequent action that may be taken by either country, may significantly vary the results our operations and financial performance from that region. There could be additional uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of contract obligations, as well as the timing and form of payments from China.\nCompetition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions, and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Variations in our fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios, have from time to time led to, and may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. In addition, newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts, and other factors have from time to time resulted in, and may in the future result in, reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.\nOur uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.\nIn some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations, and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory; and alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled, all of which we experienced from time to time in the past and may do so again in the future. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, or global logistics disruptions, have in the past adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also have produced, and may in the future produce, variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nSeparately, periodic supply chain shortages and constraints have, in some instances, resulted in, and may result in, increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we have, at times, not been able to, and may, in the future, not be able to pass on to our customers. We have, in some instances, responded to such constraints by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity. While these measures have been taken to shorten lead times to deliver products to customers, they may also result in excess or obsolete components in the future if the demand for our products is less than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In addition, as discussed in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Use of Estimates” and Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulatory and Government Risks\n28\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. Laws and regulations may change in ways that will require us to modify our business model and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. For example, as a result of laws and regulations concerning the environment, we face increasing complexity related to product design, safety and compliance; the use of regulated, hazardous, and scarce materials; the management, movement and disposal of hazardous substances and waste; the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to operations and the use of products, services, and solutions; the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the transportation and shipping of products and other materials; supply chain due diligence, and climate change, emissions and sustainability-related regulations and reporting requirements; the use of AI capabilities in our offerings; and the reuse, recycling and/or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life and associated operational or financial responsibility, as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy. A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Any changes to current environmental legal requirements, such as the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China's Administrative Measure on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, the EU's Ecodesign Directive and product-specific implementing measures (including Lot 9 on servers and online data storage products), the evolving EU and US right to repair legal landscape, and India's regulation on e-waste collection and recycling, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, U.S., China, India and/or other countries proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements. In addition, other ESG-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed, adopted, and implemented throughout the world (including, but not limited to the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the EU Taxonomy, and the proposed EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive). If we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain ESG-related laws or if our products become non-compliant with such laws or market access requirements, it could result in loss of market access or limit offerings in those markets or our customers may refuse to purchase our products, and we could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, and/or civil or criminal sanctions. Environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing and/or the cost of powering and cooling owned IT infrastructures.\nIn addition, our business is subject to an ever-growing number of laws addressing privacy and information security. In particular, we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings. The increase in aaS offerings may also be impacted by data localization and international data transfer requirements under various privacy laws, including those arising from the Schrems II ruling in Europe. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security, we could incur substantial costs or be exposed to potential regulatory fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims, and reputational damage.\nJurisdictions in which we have significant operations and assets, such as the U.S., China, India, and the E.U., each have exercised and continue to exercise significant influence over many aspects of their domestic economies including, but not limited to fair competition, tax practices, anti-corruption, anti-trust, price controls and international trade, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nContracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governments are subject to a number of challenges and risks that may adversely impact our business.\nOur contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governmental customers are subject to various government procurement laws and regulations, required contract provisions, and other requirements relating to contract formation, administration, and performance, as well as local content, manufacturing, and security requirements. Any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and fines, treble damages, and suspension from future government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, we will continue to be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts. If we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.\nGovernment contracts impose additional challenges and risks to our sales efforts. Government demand and payment for our products and services may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown, with funding reductions, or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services. Such developments could result in material payment delays, payment reductions, or contract terminations by our governmental customers, which in turn may adversely impact the results of operations and financial condition of government contractors with whom we conduct business. This may cause those government contractors to become unable to meet their obligations under contracts with us.\n29\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding, and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. In December 2022, the EU member states adopted a directive that implements the Pillar Two framework, which is expected to be enacted into the national laws of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. Certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework (e.g., United Kingdom and Korea), and several other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to implement this framework. The first component of the Pillar Two framework is expected to be effective for us in fiscal 2025 with a second component expected to be effective in fiscal 2026. When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) into law, which includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the “Corporate AMT”), beginning in fiscal 2024, of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period.  We expect U.S. cash tax to increase in the short term as a result of the Corporate AMT but do not expect the effective tax rate to be impacted as the Corporate AMT is expected to be recovered as a credit in future years.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we executed a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement which terminated our Tax Matters Agreement with HP Inc. Because we now have limited indemnity rights from HP Inc., we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments.\nRisks Related to Prior Separations\nThe stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC Technology Company or Micro Focus International plc (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us.\nThe completed separations and mergers of our former Enterprise Services business with DXC Technology Company (“DXC”) (the “Everett Transaction” or “Everett”) and our Software Segment with Micro Focus International plc (“Micro Focus”) (the “Seattle Transaction” or “Seattle”) were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of (i) the relevant distribution and related transactions as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and (ii) the relevant merger as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While the Seattle Transaction generally qualified for tax-free treatment for us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, the acquisition of Seattle SpinCo by Micro Focus resulted in the recognition of gain (but not loss) for U.S. persons who received Micro Focus American Depositary Shares in the Software separation.\nEach opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us, Everett SpinCo and CSC, or us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, as applicable. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents, the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nIf the distribution of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of\n30\nthe Code, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who receive Everett SpinCo shares or Seattle SpinCo shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nWe obtained private letter rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our Enterprise Services business and Software Segment. Those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The conclusions of the IRS private letter rulings were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, the validity of the IRS private letter rulings may be affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material. If the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business or Software Segment (including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations) are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or DXC and/or Micro Focus could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nUnder the tax matters agreements entered into by us with Everett SpinCo and CSC, and with Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, Everett SpinCo and Seattle SpinCo generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) certain actions taken by, or acquisitions of capital stock of, Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable (excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation), or (ii) any breach of certain representations and covenants made by Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable. Any such indemnity obligations could be material.\nWe continue to face a number of risks related to our separation from HP Inc., our former parent, including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and shared use of certain intellectual property rights, which could in the future adversely impact our reputation.\nIn connection with our separation from HP Inc. on November 1, 2015 (the “Separation”), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. In these agreements, HP Inc. agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of HP Inc.'s business with HP Inc. We may be obligated to fully indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities under the Separation agreements or HP Inc. may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us under the same Separation agreements. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, the terms of the Separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of HP Inc. could also adversely affect our reputation.\nGeneral Risks\nOur stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict.\nInvestors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile and can be affected by, among other things, speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community; the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures, or other significant transactions by us or our competitors; developments in our transformation programs or in our transition to an as-a-service business model; our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us; the financial results and business strategies of our competitors; inflation; market volatility or downturns caused by outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, or other macroeconomic dynamics; developments relating to pending investigations, claims, and disputes; or the timing and amount of our share repurchases. General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may affect the price of our stock. Volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\n31"

    "text": "For purposes of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) section, we use the terms “Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Discussions of fiscal 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on December 8, 2022, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.\nThis MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nTrends and Uncertainties.\nA discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management, such as the mixed macroeconomic environment, supply chain constraints (though easing), uneven demand across our portfolio, increased demand for and adoption of new technologies, conservative customer spending environment, inflationary trend and foreign exchange pressures, and recent tax developments.\n•\nExecutive Overview.\nA discussion of our business and a summary of our financial performance and other highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company in order to provide context to the remainder of the MD&A.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nA discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.\n•\nResults of Operations.\nA discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a discussion of the results of operations at the segment level.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nAn analysis and discussion of changes in our cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, and cash requirements and commitments.\n•\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n. Each non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This section also includes a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe elevated order book levels we experienced in fiscal 2022 have generally declined throughout fiscal 2023, as supply chain constraints eased (though challenges still remain) and demand softened unevenly across our portfolio (as a result of improving supply chain dynamics and as customers have been digesting their prior larger orders). Meanwhile, demand for and adoption of new technologies, such as AI, hybrid cloud, and edge computing, have increased. We have observed, and expect to continue seeing, customers of various segments and sizes pursue such new technologies. As noted above, we have continued to see elongated sales cycles, as customers work through prior orders and adopt a more conservative approach to spending in a mixed macroeconomic environment. This has been particularly true of certain of our hardware businesses, as customers have focused investments on modernizing infrastructure, such as migrating to cloud-based offerings. We expect such mixed macroeconomic environment to continue to moderate our revenue growth in the near term.\nAs referenced above, mild improvements to industry-wide supply constraints have helped to ease certain supply chain challenges we encountered in the recent past, including the increased availability of supply and lower material and logistics costs. Material cost trends are dependent on the strength or weakness of actual end-user demand and supply dynamics, which will continue to evolve and ultimately impact the translation of the cost environment to our pricing actions and, consequently, our operating results. Logistics costs continued to decrease from previously elevated levels as a result of declines in both expedited shipments and overall rate costs in the freight network.\n35\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAdditionally, we continue to experience a challenging foreign exchange environment, which has increased costs of products and services and moderated our revenue and earnings growth. We have a large global presence, with more than half of our revenue generated outside of the U.S. As a result, our financial results can be, and particularly in recent periods have been, impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Furthermore, inflationary pressures persist, keeping not only material and logistics costs, but also labor costs, somewhat elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. We expect the unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary trend to continue in the longer term.\nRecent Tax Developments\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. In December 2022, the EU member states adopted a directive that implements the Pillar Two framework, which is expected to be enacted into the national laws of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. Certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework (e.g., United Kingdom and Korea), and several other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to implement this framework. The first component of the Pillar Two framework is expected to be effective for us in fiscal 2025 with a second component expected to be effective in fiscal 2026. When and how this framework is adopted or enacted by the various countries in which we do business could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the “Corporate AMT”) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2024. We expect U.S. cash tax to increase in the short term as a result of the Corporate AMT but do not expect the effective tax rate to be impacted as the Corporate AMT is expected to be recovered as a credit in future years. The realizability of any deferred tax asset associated with the Corporate AMT will be determined through our annual valuation allowance analysis. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is conducting audits of our fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments (“NOPAs”) for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 relating to our intercompany transfer pricing. After the close of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. The IRS is seeking to increase taxable income across the three fiscal years by $904 million. As of the balance sheet date, we have sufficient tax credit carryforwards to offset any incremental tax liability from the adjustments in the RAR. However, we disagree with the IRS’ adjustments and believe the positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to prevail on technical merits, and we will defend these positions through the IRS administrative processes, as necessary. Accordingly, no changes have been made to our reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023 relating to the IRS’ adjustments.\nRussia/Ukraine Conflict\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., European Union and other countries in response have negatively impacted our operations in both countries and increased economic and political uncertainty across the world. In response to the sanctions imposed, in February 2022, we suspended all new sales and shipments to Russia and Belarus and implemented compliance measures to address the continuously changing regulatory landscape. Based on a further assessment of business risks and needs, in June 2022, we determined that it was no longer tenable to maintain our operations in Russia and Belarus and have been proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of our remaining business in these countries.\nOther Trends and Uncertainties\nWe have observed market trends and demand gravitating towards AI, hybrid cloud, and edge computing, and data securities capabilities, and offerings. The volume of data at the edge continues to grow, driven by the proliferation of more devices, which has led to the need for enhanced security at the edge, as well. The need for a unified cloud experience everywhere has grown, as well, in order to manage the growth of data at the edge. With the abundance of data, there are opportunities to develop AI tools with powerful computational abilities to extract insights and value from the captured data. We expect these market dynamics and trends to continue in the longer term.\n36\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nObserving these dynamics, we have accelerated our investment and innovation efforts in these areas that we see as critical to our long-term strategy and growth, including in pivoting our go-to-market motion and sales function. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our core Compute and Storage-oriented offerings and expand our offerings on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, to enable execution of our aaS pivot to become the edge-to-cloud company for our customers and partners. Furthermore, as noted elsewhere in this report, effective November 1, 2023, we have realigned our financial reporting segments to align with these key market trends. It is uncertain whether we will successfully execute this shift in strategic focus, realize the anticipated benefits of doing so, or capture the anticipated shares of the AI, hybrid cloud, and edge markets.\nThe following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal\n2023\nto fiscal\n2022\n, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and, Cash Requirements and Commitments sections present information as of October 31, 2023, unless otherwise noted.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNet revenue of $29.1 billion represented an increase of 2.2%\n(increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to higher average unit prices (“AUPs”) in the Intelligent Edge and Compute segments, and higher customer acceptances in the High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”) segment. The increase in net revenue was moderated by a decline in server unit volume in the Compute segment and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The gross profit margin of 35.1% (or $10.2 billion) represents an increase of 1.7 percentage points from the prior-year period due to the impact of higher-margin networking revenue, higher AUPs in Intelligent Edge and Compute, and lower supply chain and commodity costs. T\nhe operating profit margin of 7.2%, repre\nsents an increase of 4.5 percentage points primarily due to the aforementioned gross margin improvement, goodwill impairment charges for the HPC & AI and Software businesses in the prior-year period, and lower transformation expenses in the current period. The increase in operating profit margin was moderated by higher planned investments in research and development in the current period.\nFinancial Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated GAAP financial results:\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated non-GAAP financial results:\n37\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nEach non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure herein. Please refer to the section “GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations” included in this MD&A for these reconciliations, a discussion of the use, usefulness and economic substance of the non-GAAP financial measures, along with a discussion of material limitations, and compensation for those limitations, associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nAnnualized Revenue Run-rate (“ARR”)\nOur pivot to aaS continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. Our mix of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds.\nARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service, software consumption revenue, and other aaS offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We believe that ARR is a metric that allows management to better understand and highlight the potential future performance of our aaS business. We also believe ARR provides investors with greater transparency to our financial information and of the performance metric used in our financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes of management.” We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.\nARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.\nThe following presents our ARR as of October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThe 39% year over year increase in ARR was due primarily to growth in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, which was due to an expanding customer installed base and expanded range of offerings on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. At the segment level, the growth was led by Intelligent Edge aaS and Storage aaS activity.\nReturning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, which also consists of strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. As of October 31, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $4.6 billion, compared to $4.8 billion as of October 31, 2022, representing a decrease of $0.2 billion.\n38\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEstimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nWe believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners, and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts,  price protection, and other incentive programs.\nSignificant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nTo recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly observable and requires the Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs.  For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically.\nTaxes on Earnings\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.\n39\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOur effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax, or cash management reasons.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 85 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our Provision for taxes, Net earnings and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nAs of October 31, 2023, our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other which contains five reporting units: Advisory and Professional Services, Athonet, legacy Communications and Media Solutions business, OpsRamp and Software.\nWhen performing the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For two of our reporting units, Athonet and OpsRamp, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount.  The qualitative assessment requires management judgement in assessing factors including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic and industry environment as well as Company-specific factors.  The assessments for Athonet and OpsRamp as of our test date indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of these two reporting units are less than their carrying amounts.\nFor all of our other reporting units, we conduct a quantitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived mostly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach, with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived solely from the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted cash flow analysis of management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, expected operating margins, and timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions and customer acceptances. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nOur annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 5% to 218% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting\n40\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nunit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, except for Compute.\nThe Compute reporting unit has goodwill of $7.7 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of 5% as of the annual test date. The Compute business is facing challenges reflected in the results for October 31, 2023. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. Over the last several years, digital transformation drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, in the current macroeconomic and inflationary environment, customers have slowed their investments resulting in lower server demand and competitive pricing. These dynamics are further compounded by higher supply chain costs. During this cycle, the Compute business continues to focus on capturing market share while maintaining operating margin.\nThe HPC & AI reporting unit has goodwill of $2.9 billion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of 12% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business continues to face challenges related to supply chain constraints of key components and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. We currently believe these challenges will be successfully addressed as the supply chain constraints continue to improve.\nIn addition, effective November 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024), there were organizational changes impacting the composition of our reporting units. These changes will require us to perform an interim impairment assessment as of that date. If the global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen, projected revenue growth rates or projected operating margins are not achieved, weighted average cost of capital increases, or if we have a significant sustained decline in our stock price, it is possible our estimates about the Compute, HPC & AI, or our other reporting units’ ability to successfully address the current challenges may change, which could result in the carrying value for our reporting units exceeding their estimated fair value resulting in potential impairment charges.\nOur fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill related to the HPC & AI and Software reporting units. There was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting units.\nThe decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit in fiscal 2022 below its carrying value resulted from changes in expected future cash flows due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges as well as an increase in cost of capital. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $815 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit in fiscal 2022 resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case.\nBased on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2023, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.\n41\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) the prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nResults of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\n42\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nNet revenue\nIn fiscal 2023, total net revenue of $29.1 billion represented an increase of $639 million, or 2.2% (increased 5.5% on a constant currency basis). U.S. net revenue increased by $944 million, or 10.0% to $10.4 billion, and net revenue from outside of the U.S. decreased by $305 million, or 1.6%, to $18.7 billion.\nThe components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows:\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nFrom a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in total net revenue are summarized as follows:\n•\nCompute net revenue decrease of $1,414 million, or 11.0%, primarily due to a decline in server unit volume and unfavorable currency fluctuations moderated by higher AUPs\n•\nHPC & AI net revenue increase of $721 million, or 22.6%, primarily due to higher customer acceptances\n•\nStorage net revenue decrease of $188 million, or 4.1%, primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations\n•\nIntelligent Edge net revenue increase of $1,530 million, or 41.6%, primarily due to increased AUPs and volume and product mix effect\n•\nFinancial Services net revenue increase of $141 million, or 4.2%, primarily due to higher rental revenue from higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance leases due to an increasing interest rate environment\n•\nCorporate Investments and Other net revenue decrease of $5 million, or 0.4%, primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations\nGross Profit\nFiscal 2023 total gross profit margin of 35.1% represents an increase of 1.7 percentage points as compared to the respective prior year period. The increase was due to the impact of higher-margin networking revenue, higher AUPs in  Intelligent Edge and Compute, and lower supply chain and commodity costs. Additionally, the increase was partially offset by lower gross profit from support services.\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development (“R&D”)\nR&D expense increased by $304 million, or 14.9%, led by Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI and Storage. The increase was driven by higher employee costs due to an increase in software engineers to pursue our strategic goals, which contributed 15.6 percentage points to the change.\n43\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)\nSG&A expense increased by $219 million, or 4.4%, due primarily to higher travel and marketing expenses by 1.8 percentage points; increased employee costs by 1.7 percentage points; factoring fees, charitable donations, other general expenses and higher software expenditures, all of which contributed 1.9 percentage points to the change. The increase was partially offset by a combination of lower consulting costs and cost savings from our transformation programs.\nImpairment of goodwill\nImpairment of goodwill for fiscal 2022 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of $905 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI and Software reporting units was below the carrying value of their net assets.\nTransformation programs and costs\nOur transformation programs consist of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan (launched in 2020) and the HPE Next Plan (launched in 2017).\nTransformation costs\ndecreased by $190 million, or 40.2%, due to lower charges incurred in the current period as these plans approach completion. Refer to Note 3, “Transformation Programs” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II for further discussion.\nDisaster charges\nDisaster charges decreased by $47 million or 97.9% due to charges recorded in fiscal 2022 driven by the Company’s exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses.\nInterest and other, net\nInterest and other, net expense decreased by $32 million, due to favorable currency fluctuations and an increase in net interest income from higher interest rates, partially offset by an increase in impairments recorded on equity investments in fiscal 2023.\nTax indemnification and other adjustments\nWe record changes in certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification.\nWe recorded Tax indemnification and other adjustments income of $55 million and expense of $67 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2023, Tax indemnification and other adjustments included the favorable settlement of tax indemnification liabilities for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities. In fiscal 2022, Tax indemnification and other adjustments resulted from changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities, for which we partially shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement, and changes to certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables.\nNon-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit\nNon-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs, other than service cost, for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses. The benefit (cost) credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements, curtailments, or special termination benefits.\nIn fiscal 2023, Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit decreased by $137 million resulting in non-service net periodic benefit cost of $3 million in the current period, as compared to non-service net periodic benefit credit of $134 million in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to higher interest cost as a result of higher discount rates, partially offset by higher expected returns on assets and lower amortized actuarial losses in the current period.\n44\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nEarnings from equity interests\nEarnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49% interest in H3C Technologies Co., Limited (“H3C”) and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference. In fiscal 2023, Earnings from equity interests increased by $30 million due primarily to lower amortization expense from basis difference in the current period.\nProvision for taxes\nFor fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $205 million and $8 million, respectively, which reflect effective tax rates of 9.2% and 0.9%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year. Our tax rate for fiscal 2022 also included the effects of the non-deductible goodwill impairment. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.\nIn fiscal 2023, we recorded $131 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n•\n$104 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges and\n•\n$19 million of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nIn fiscal 2022, we recorded $454 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n•\n$150 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances,\n•\n$99 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,\n•\n$43 million of income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters,\n•\n$42 million of income tax benefits related to the release of U.S. passive foreign tax credit valuation allowance,\n•\n$30 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which we shared joint and several liability with, and for which we were indemnified by, HP Inc.,\n•\n$27 million of income tax benefits related to the utilization of capital losses which had a full valuation allowance,\n•\n$12 million of income tax benefits as a result of the fiscal 2021 U.S. tax return filing primarily from the decrease in Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, and\n•\n$11 million of net income tax benefits related to settlements and ongoing discussions in foreign tax audit matters.\nSegment Information\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), who is the CEO, uses to evaluate, view, and run our business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results.\nA description of the products and services for each segment, along with other pertinent information related to Segments can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nSegment Results\nThe following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022:\n45\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\n(1)\nHPE consolidated net revenue excludes inter-segment net revenue.\n(2)\nSegment earnings from operations exclude certain unallocated corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\nCompute\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nCompute net revenue decreased by $1,414 million, or 11.0% (decreased 7.1% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to a $1,424 million, or 14.3%, decrease in product revenue. The decline in product revenue was primarily due to lower server unit volume of $1,889 million, or 18.9%, and unfavorable currency fluctuations of $399 million. The product revenue decline was moderated by an increase in AUPs of $864 million, or 8.7%, led by higher sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures in our next generation products.\nCompute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.5 percentage points primarily due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by a decrease in the cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the scale of the net revenue decline. The decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher AUPs moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations and higher supply chain costs.\nHPC & AI\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nHPC & AI net revenue increased by $721 million, or 22.6% (increased 25.2% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to a $759 million, or 33.6%, increase in product revenue. The product revenue increase was led by the HPE Cray Supercomputing product portfolio, as operational and supply improvements addressed challenges with achieving certain\n46\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\ncustomer acceptance milestones for revenue recognition. HPE Cray Supercomputing experienced a deal volume increase of $991 million, or 43.9 %, moderated by lower AUPs of $358 million, or 15.8%. The product revenue was also impacted by unfavorable currency fluctuation of $69 million. Services revenue declined by $38 million, or 4.1%, primarily due to unfavorable portfolio mix of service offerings.\nHPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat, driven by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by an increase in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue.\nStorage\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nStorage net revenue decreased\nby $188 million, or 4.1%\n(decreased 0.7% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations and a decrease in AUPs. Storage product revenue decreased by $187 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations of $122 million, a decrease in AUPs of $21 million, or 0.8%, led by HPE Alletra Storage portfolio and big data, a unit volume decrease of $25 million, or 0.9%, led by HPE Alletra Storage portfolio and moderated by big data, and lower revenue from Russia of $20 million. Storage services revenue remained relatively flat.\nStorage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decr\neased 4.2 perce\nntage points due to increases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations partially offset by lower supply chain costs. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to incremental investments in R&D and field selling costs.\nIntelligent Edge\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nIntelligent Edge net revenue increased by $1,530 million, or 41.6% (increased 44.9% on a constant currency basis). Product revenue increased by $1,387 million, or 46.5%, led by higher AUPs of $1,257 million, or 42.2%, and a volume and product mix effect of $236 million, or 7.9%, moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations of $106 million. The product revenue increase was led by switching and wireless local area network products, which benefited from improvements in the supply availability, and elevated order book levels at the beginning of the period. Services net revenue increased $143 million, or 20.6%, primarily led by our aaS and attached support service offerings.\nIntelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 12.4 percentage points primarily due to decreases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to lower supply chain costs, moderating the decrease was a lower mix of higher-margin support services revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to our cost containment measures.\n47\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFinancial Services\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nFS net revenue increased by $141 million, or 4.2% (increased 5.4% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to higher rental revenue from higher average operating leases and higher finance income on finance leases due to an increasing interest rate environment, partially offset by lower asset management revenue primarily from lower pre-owned asset sales and unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nFS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 2.8 percentage points due primarily to an increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue, while operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were relatively flat. The increase to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from a combination of higher borrowing costs and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.\nFinancing Volume\nFinancing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 2.6% in fiscal 2023 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher financing of HPE product sales and services, partially offset by lower financing of third-party product sales and services and unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nPortfolio Assets and Ratios\nThe FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n48\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:\n(1)\nIntercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation.\n(2)\nAllowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions.\n(3)\nDebt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.6 billion and $11.5 billion at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at October 31, 2023 and 2022, was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\nAs of\nOctober 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, FS net cash and cash equivalents balances were $700 million and $923 million, respectively.\nNet portfolio assets as of\nOctober 31, 2023\nincreased 4.3% from October 31, 2022. The increase generally resulted from new financing volume exceeding portfolio runoff during the period, along with favorable currency fluctuations.\nFS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, direct-financing and operating leases. FS recorded net bad debt expense of $59 million, $82 million and $95 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCorporate Investments and Other\nFiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022\nCorporate Investments and Other net revenue decreased by $5 million, or 0.4% (increased 3.3% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nCorporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 6.5 percenta\nge points primarily due to an increase in cost of services and operating expense as a percentage of net revenue.\nThe increase in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations, higher services delivery costs and higher variable compensation expense. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense.\n49\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Overview\nWe use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product development initiatives, acquisitions and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to any future investments, share repurchases, and stockholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions. We anticipate that the funds made available and cash generated from operations along with our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A.\nOur cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held outside the U.S as of October 31, 2023. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to provide availability of our worldwide cash when and where it is needed.\nAmounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of amounts held outside the U.S. generally should not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on the repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with the share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, during fiscal 2023, we repurchased and settled an aggregate amount of $0.4 billion. As of October 31, 2023, we had a remaining authorization of approximately $1.0 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on our share repurchase program, refer to Note 15, “Stockholders' Equity,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nPursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among our relevant subsidiaries, Unisplendour International Technology Limited (“UNIS”), and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and most recently on October 28, 2022, we delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise our right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by us, which represent 49% of the total issued share capital of H3C. On May 26, 2023, our relevant subsidiaries entered into a Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held by us, through our subsidiaries, for a total pre-tax cash consideration of $3.5 billion. We intend to consider a range of allocation activities, in line with our practice of pursuing a balanced, returns-based approach for capital allocation decisions, including but not limited to organic and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt, and general corporate purposes. The disposition remains subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and completion of certain conditions necessary for closing.\n50\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nLiquidity\nOur cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, total debt and available borrowing resources were as follows:\n(1)\nThe maximum aggregate borrowing amount of the commercial paper programs and revolving credit facility is $5.75 billion.\n(2)\nThe maximum aggregate capacity under the uncommitted lines of credit is $1.8 billion of which $0.3 billion was primarily utilized towards issuances of bank guarantees.\nThe tables below represent the way in which management reviews cash flows:\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decrease\nd by $165 million for\nfiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable working capital primarily resulting from higher vendor payments and an increase in financing receivables, moderated by unfavorable hedging positions, lower cash payouts for variable compensation, and favorable impacts from other assets and liabilities during the current period.\nOur working capital metrics and cash conversion impacts were as follows:\nThe cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity.\nDSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. Compared to the three-month\n51\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nperiod ending October 31, 2022, the decrease in DSO by 4 days in the current period was primarily due to higher early collections and receivables factoring.\nDOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period ending October 31, 2022, the DOS remained relatively flat.\nDPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. Compared to the corresponding three-month period ending October 31, 2022, the decrease in DPO by 15 days in the current period was primarily due to lower inventory purchases during the current period.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to payments made in connection with business acquisitions of $0.8 billion, higher cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of $0.5 billion, lower proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, net of purchases of $0.2 billion, offset by lower investment in property, plant and equipment of $0.3 billion, as compared to the prior-year period.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from debt, net of issuance costs of $1.4 billion, offset by higher repayments of debt and short-term borrowings of $1.0 billion, as compared to the prior-year period.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (“FCF”) represents cash flow from operations, less net capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF increased by $0.4 billion in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, due to a favorable currency impact on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, lower cash utilized for investments in PP&E, moderated by lower cash provided from operations, as compared to the prior-year period. For more information on our FCF, refer to the section entitled “GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliations” included in this MD&A.\nFor more information on the impact from operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nCapital Resources\nDebt Levels\nWe maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure. We maintain a revolving credit facility and two commercial paper programs, \"the Parent Programs\", and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. There have been no changes to our commercial paper programs and revolving credit facility since October 31, 2022.\nIn December 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depository shares, purchase contracts, guarantees or units consisting of any of these securities. The shelf registration statement expired in December 2023, and we expect to file a new shelf registration statement around the time of the filing of this report.\n52\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nSignificant funding and liquidity activities for fiscal 2023 were as follows:\nDebt Issuances:\n•\nIn March 2023 and June 2023, we issued $1.3 billion and $250 million, respectively, of 5.90% Senior Notes due October 1, 2024\n•\nIn March 2023, we issued $400 million of 6.102% Senior Notes due April 1, 2026\n•\nIn March and April 2023, we issued $643 million of asset-backed debt securities in five tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 5.59% and final maturity date of April 20, 2028\n•\nIn June 2023, we issued $550 million of 5.25% Senior Notes due July 1, 2028\n•\nIn September 2023, we issued $612 million of asset-backed debt securities in six tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 6.40% and final maturity date of July 21, 2031\n.\nDebt Repayments:\n•\nIn April 2023, we repaid $1.0 billion of 2.25% fixed rate Senior Notes\n•\nIn October 2023, we repaid $1.25 billion of 4.45% Senior Notes\n•\nDuring fiscal 2023, we repaid $1.7 billion of the outstanding asset-backed debt securities.\nOur weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nFor more information on our available borrowing resources and the impact of operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” and Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nCash Requirements and Commitments\nLong-term debt and interest payments on debt\nAs of October 31, 2023, future principal payment obligations on our long-term debt including asset-backed debt securities totaled $11.7 billion of which $4.0 billion is due within one year. As of October 31, 2023, our finance lease obligations, including interest, was $48 million, of which $6 million is to be due within one year. For more information on our debt, see Note 14, “Borrowings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nAs of October 31, 2023, future interest payments relating to our long-term debt is estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion, of which $0.6 billion is expected to be due within one year. We use interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps as of October 31, 2023 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.\nOperating lease obligations\nWe enter into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and aviation. As of October 31, 2023, operating lease obligations, net of sublease rental income totaled $1.6 billion, of which $216 million is due within one year. These amounts included uncommenced operating leases as of October 31, 2023, and did not reflect imputed interest adjustments. For more information on our leases, see Note 8, “Accounting for Leases as a Lessee,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nUnconditional purchase obligations\nOur unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. As of October 31, 2023, unconditional purchase obligations totaled $1.6 billion, of which $580 million is due within one year. For more information on our unconditional purchase obligations, see Note 19, “Commitments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\n53\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRetirement Benefit Plan Funding\nIn fiscal 2024, we anticipate making contributions of $182 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is to fund pension plans to meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are not considered as contractual obligations because they do not represent contractual cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nRestructuring Plans\nAs of October 31, 2023, we expect future cash payments of approximately $360 million in connection with our approved restructuring plans, which includes $240 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2024 and $120 million expected to be paid thereafter. Payments for restructuring activities are not considered as contractual obligations, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, “Transformation Programs,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of October 31, 2023, we had approximately $224 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $9 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nWe have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\n54\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods presented:\nReconciliation of GAAP gross profit and gross profit margin to non-GAAP gross profit and gross profit margin.\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings from operations and operating profit margin to non-GAAP earnings from operations and operating profit margin.\n55\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nReconciliation of GAAP net earnings and diluted net earnings per share to non-GAAP net earnings and diluted net earnings per share.\n(1)     Represents the amortization of basis difference adjustments related to the H3C divestiture. Fiscal 2023 included the Company's portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C of $8 million.\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\n56\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis (including at the business segment level), non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, and FCF. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP income tax rate is income tax rate. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FCF is cash flow from operations.\nWe believe that providing the non-GAAP measures stated above, in addition to the related GAAP measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information provides investors with a supplemental view to understand our historical and prospective\noperating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of our operating performance with the performance of other companies in the same industry that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner.\nEconomic Substance of non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change to the foreign exchange rate utilized in the comparable prior-year period. This measure assists investors with evaluating our past and future performance, without the impact of foreign exchange rates, as more than half of our revenue is generated outside of the U.S.\nWe believe that excluding the items mentioned below from the non-GAAP financial measures provides a supplemental view to management and our investors of our consolidated financial performance and presents the financial results of the business without costs that we do not believe to be reflective of our ongoing operating results. Exclusion of these items can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP measure and cash flows thus limiting the use of such non-GAAP financial measures as analytic tools. See “Compensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for further information.\nNon-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin are defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense, and disaster charges. See below for the reasons management excludes each item:\n•\nAmortization of initial direct costs represents the portion of lease origination costs incurred in prior fiscal years that do not qualify for capitalization under the new leasing standard. We exclude these costs as we elected the practical expedient under the new leasing standard. As a result, we did not adjust these historical costs to accumulated deficit.       We believe that most financing companies did not elect this practical expedient and therefore we exclude these costs.       This can have an impact on the equivalent GAAP measures and Financial Services segment results.\n•\nStock-based compensation expense consists of equity awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are non-cash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation expense.\n•\nDisaster (recovery) charges are primarily related to the exit of our businesses in Russia and Belarus, and include credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets. Disaster (recovery) charges also include direct costs or recovery of these costs related to COVID-19 as a result of Hewlett Packard Enterprise-hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored event cancellations and subsequent shift to a virtual format. While we present various items as\n57\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nDisaster charges (recovery), we exclude Disaster charges (recovery) from these non-GAAP measures as the specific charges are non-recurring charges and not indicative of the operational performance of our business.\nNon-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin consist of earnings from operations or earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue excluding the items mentioned above and charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets, goodwill impairment, transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. In addition to the items previously explained above, management excludes these items for the following reasons:\n•\nWe incur charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets and exclude these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges for the purpose of calculating these non-GAAP measures, primarily because they are noncash expenses and our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding intangible asset amortization. Although this does not directly affect our cash position, the loss in value of intangible assets over time can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measure.\n•\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recorded an impairment charge for the goodwill associated with its HPC & AI and Software reporting units following the annual goodwill impairment review. Hewlett Packard Enterprise excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of  current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in other periods.\n•\nTransformation costs represent net costs related to the (i) HPE Next Plan and (ii) Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and include restructuring charges, program design and execution costs, costs incurred to transform our IT infrastructure, net gains from the sale of real estate and any impairment charges on real estate identified as part of the initiatives. We exclude these costs as they are discrete costs related to two specific transformation programs that were announced in 2017 and 2020, respectively, as multi-year programs necessary to transform the business and IT infrastructure following material divestiture transactions in 2017 and in response to COVID-19 and an evolving product portfolio in fiscal 2020. The primary elements of the HPE Next and the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially completed by October 31, 2023. The exclusion of the transformation program costs from our non-GAAP financial measures as stated above is to provide a supplemental measure of our operating results that does not include material HPE Next Plan and Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan costs as we do not believe such costs to be reflective of our ongoing operating cost structure. Further as our transformation costs for these plans have materially fluctuated since 2017, have been materially declining since 2021 and we do not expect to incur material transformation costs related to these programs beyond fiscal 2023, we believe non-GAAP measures excluding these costs are useful to management and investors for comparing operating performance across multiple periods.\n•\nWe incur costs related to our acquisition, disposition and other related charges. The charges are direct expenses, such as professional fees and retention costs, most of which are treated as non-cash or non-capitalized expenses. Charges may also include expenses associated with disposal activities including legal and arbitration settlements in connection with certain dispositions. We exclude these costs as these expenses are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of our acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, our internal benchmarking analyses evidence that many industry participants and peers present non-GAAP financial measures excluding these charges.\nNon-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges mentioned above, as well as other items such as tax indemnification and other adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit cost (credit), earnings from equity interests, impairment of investment, and adjustments for taxes. The Adjustments for taxes line item includes certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of tax reform, structural rate adjustment, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, and adjustments for additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. In addition to the items previously explained, management excludes these items for the following reasons:\n•\nTax indemnification and other adjustments are primarily related to changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification. We exclude these income or charges and the associated tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.\n58\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\n•\nNon-service net periodic benefit cost (credit) includes certain market-related factors such as (i) interest cost, (ii) expected return on plan assets, (iii) amortization of prior plan amendments, (iv) amortized actuarial gains or losses, (v) the impacts of any plan settlements/curtailments and (vi) impacts from other market-related factors associated with our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans. These market-driven retirement-related adjustments are primarily due to the change in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance. We exclude these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and consider them to be outside the operational performance of the business.\n•\nAdjustment to earnings from equity interests includes the amortization of the basis difference in relation to the H3C divestiture and the resulting equity method investment in H3C. In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, this adjustment also included our portion of intangible asset impairment charges from H3C. We believe that eliminating this amount for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.\n•\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, HPE recorded an impairment charge for an equity investment resulting from a permanent reduction of the investee’s assets. This adjustment was reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We believe eliminating impairment of investment for the purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures facilitates the evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to operating performance in prior periods.\n•\nWe utilize a structural long-term projected non-GAAP income tax rate in order to provide consistency across the interim reporting periods and to eliminate the effects of items not directly related to our operating structure that can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, we evaluated a three-year financial projection. The projected rate assumes no incremental acquisitions in the three-year projection period and considers other factors including our expected tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions and current impacts from key legislation implemented in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, we used a non-GAAP income tax rate of 14%. The non-GAAP income tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. We believe that making these adjustments for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, facilitates a supplemental evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results.\nFCF is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as cash flow from operations, excluding the impact of proceeds received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 from a one-time Itanium litigation judgment, less net capital expenditures (investments in PP&E less proceeds from the sale of PP&E), and adjusted for the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. FCF does not represent the total increase or decrease in cash for the period. Our management and investors can use FCF for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in our businesses, repurchasing stock and other purposes as well as evaluating our historical and prospective liquidity.\nCompensation for Limitations With Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non- GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures and cash flows, they may be calculated differently by other companies (limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes) and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets.\nWe compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for this fiscal year and prior periods, and we encourage investors to review those reconciliations carefully.\n59"

    "text": "In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below.\nActual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2023 were the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.\nWe use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, consisting primarily of forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $48 million and $49 million at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInterest rate risk\nWe also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued, our debt investment portfolio and net portfolio assets of our Financial Services segment. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing.\nWe often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve U.S. dollar based floating or fixed interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, in circumstances where we believe additional fixed-rate debt would be beneficial, we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap, or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, debt investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, debt investments, net portfolio assets, and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt, debt investments and net portfolio assets, net of interest rate swaps, of $41 million and $32 million at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor more information about our debt, use of derivative instruments, forward contracts and investments, Refer to Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, Note 13, Financial Instruments”, and Note 14, “Borrowings”, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements section included in this report.\n60"

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nHouston, Texas\nDecember 22, 2023\n64\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Hewlett Packard Enterprise are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's management assessed the effectiveness of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on the assessment by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management, we determined that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2023. The effectiveness of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report on the preceding pages.\n65\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n66\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n67\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n68\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n69\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1:\nOverview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBackground\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” “HPE,” or the “Company”) is a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. Hewlett Packard Enterprise enables customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's customers range from small- and medium-sized businesses to large global enterprises and governmental entities.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the consolidated businesses of the Company have been eliminated.\nThe Company consolidates a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity's operation. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE by considering the purpose and design of the entity and the risks the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. The Company also evaluates its economic interests in the VIE.\nThe Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not hold a controlling interest under the equity method of accounting, and the Company records its proportionate share of income or losses in Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nNon-controlling interests are presented as a separate component within Total stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are recorded within Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately, as they were not material for any periods presented.\nSegment Realignment\nEffective as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, in order to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure, the Company implemented an organizational change with the transfer of certain storage networking products, previously reported within the Storage reportable segment, to the Compute reportable segment. The Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue and operating profit for each of the segments as described above. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, net earnings, net earnings per share (“EPS”) or total assets.\nRussia/Ukraine Conflict\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., European Union and other countries in response have negatively impacted the Company's operations in both countries and increased economic and political uncertainty across the world. In response to the sanctions imposed, in February 2022, the Company suspended all new sales and shipments to Russia and Belarus and implemented compliance measures to address the continuously changing regulatory landscape. Based on a further assessment of business risks and needs, in June 2022, the Company determined that it was no longer tenable to maintain its operations in Russia and Belarus and has been proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of its remaining business in these countries.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company recorded total pre-tax charges of $\n161\nmillion primarily related to expected credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets, $\n99\nmillion of which was included in Financing cost, $\n12\nmillion in Cost of services and $\n50\nmillion in Disaster charges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\n71\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, net periodic benefit costs, restructuring accruals, provision for taxes, valuation allowance for deferred taxes, provision for expected credit losses, inventory reserves, and impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The Company believes that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. Should any of these estimates change, it could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies are recorded in U.S. dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The Company includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and gains and losses from cash flow hedges in Net revenue as the hedged revenue is recognized. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and the Company records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when both parties have provided written approval and are committed to perform, each party's rights including payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is probable.\nThe Company enters into contracts with customers that typically include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services. The Company determines whether each product or service is distinct in order to identify the performance obligations in the contract and allocate the contract transaction price among the distinct performance obligations. Arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether the commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. The Company classifies its hardware, perpetual software licenses, service arrangements and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where the Company delivers hardware or software, it is typically the principal and records revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, in exchange for those products or services. Variable consideration offered in contracts with customers, partners and distributors may include rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nTransfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. The Company's hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On its product sales, the Company records consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. Revenue is recorded net of any associated sales taxes.\n72\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe Company allocates the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price (“SSP”) is the price at which an entity would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. For products and services sold as a bundle, the SSP is generally not directly observable and requires the Company to estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs.  For certain products and services, the Company establishes SSP based on the observable price when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically.\nJudgment is applied in determining the transaction price as the Company may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration may include various rebates, volume-based discounts, price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, partners and distributors. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, the Company estimates the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. The Company also considers the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nContract Balances\nAccounts receivable and contract assets\nA receivable is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services the Company has transferred to a customer that is unconditional. A contract asset is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services transferred to a customer that is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.\nThe Company's contract assets include unbilled receivables which are recorded when the Company recognizes revenue in advance of billings. Unbilled receivables generally relate to services contracts where a service has been performed and control has transferred, but invoicing to the customer is subject to future milestone billings or other contractual payment schedules. The Company classifies unbilled receivables as Accounts receivable.\nContract liabilities\nA contract liability is an obligation to transfer products or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration, or the amount is due, from the customer. The Company's contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is recorded when amounts invoiced to customers are in excess of revenue that can be recognized because performance obligations have not been satisfied and control of the promised products or services has not transferred to the customer. Deferred revenue largely represents amounts invoiced in advance for product (hardware/software) support contracts, consulting projects and product sales where revenue cannot be recognized yet.\nCosts to obtain a contract with a customer\nThe Company capitalizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, primarily sales commissions, if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, to expense the costs of obtaining a contract as incurred for contracts with terms of one year or less. The typical amortization periods used range from\ntwo\nto\nfive years\n. The Company periodically reviews the capitalized sales commission costs for possible impairment losses. The amortization of capitalized costs to obtain a contract are included in Selling, general and administrative expense. Refer to Note 7, “Balance Sheet Details” for additional information.\nShipping and Handling\nThe Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the measurement date fair value of the award and is recognized only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units with only a service condition is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For stock options and restricted stock units with both a service condition and a performance or market condition, the expense is recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based\n73\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\ncompensation expense is determined at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience.\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Plans\nThe Company has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory, retirement and post-retirement plans. The costs and obligations for these plans depend on various assumptions. Major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. These assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.”\nThe discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures.\nThe following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on the net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2023:\nThe Company generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life or, in the case of closed plans, life expectancy of participants. In limited cases, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor approach.\nAdvertising\nCosts to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising expense totaled approximately $\n173\nmillion, $\n179\nmillion, and $\n188\nmillion in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nRestructuring\nThe Company's transformation programs include charges to approved restructuring plans. Restructuring charges include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. These restructuring actions require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs. The Company records restructuring charges based on estimated employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of the Company's restructuring actions, refer to the discussions in Note 3, “Transformation Programs.”\n74\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nTaxes on Earnings\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were to determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which such a determination was made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, the Company would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for the Company to realize deferred tax assets, the Company must be able to generate sufficient taxable income, of the appropriate character, in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located, prior to their expiration under applicable tax laws.\nThe Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions as well as any related interest and penalties. The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax in the U.S. The Company elected to treat taxes on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts Receivable\nThe allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. The Company may record a specific reserve for individual accounts when the Company becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, the Company further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers and the length of time receivables are past due. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. The Company establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables.\nFinancing Receivable\nThe allowance for expected credit losses related to financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. The Company establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely the Company will recover its investment. For individually evaluated receivables, the Company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the collateral and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered probable, the Company records a specific reserve. The Company maintains a general reserve using a credit loss model on a regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in the overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic conditions, and forward-looking information, including reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific reserve from the general reserve analysis. The Company generally writes off a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or sooner if the Company determines that the receivable is not collectible.\nNon-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables\nThe Company considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by the contractually specified due date. The Company generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, which is the\n75\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nsuspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of the time at which full payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past due. Subsequently, the Company may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables as payments are received, which is on a cash basis, if the Company deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the recorded financing receivable, all cash receipts are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain circumstances, such as when the Company deems a delinquency to be of an administrative nature, financing receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable may not impact a customer's risk rating. After all of a customer's delinquent principal and interest balances are settled, the Company may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.\nThe Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, derivatives, and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in many different geographic regions, and the Company's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of its risk management processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. The Company utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss. For more details on the collateral program, see Note 13, “Financial Instruments.”\nCredit risk with respect to accounts receivable from trade customers and financing receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022 no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's receivable from trade customers and financing receivables.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash is included within Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is primarily related to cash received under the Company's collateral securities agreements for its derivative instruments and cash restricted under the fixed-term securitization program for the issuance of asset-backed debt securities.\nInventory\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the value of its inventory and writes down the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required, for estimated excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in future demand forecasts, market conditions, technological changes, product life-cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration, and quality issues. The write down for excess or obsolescence is charged to the provision of inventory, which is a component of Cost of Products and Cost of Services in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nThe Company states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are\nfive\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and improvements and\nthree\nto\n15\nyears for machinery and equipment. The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. The Company depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services contract generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related\n76\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\naccumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and installation and testing of the software. The Company amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from\nthree\nto\nfive years\n.\nLeases\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company enters into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and aviation. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement contains a lease when the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset over the lease term. Upon lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-use (“ROU”) asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The lease liability is measured at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments not yet paid over the lease term and the Company's incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which the Company would borrow, on a secured basis, in the country where the lease was executed. The ROU asset is based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fixed payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets and liabilities, while non-lease components, such as maintenance or utility charges are expensed as incurred. The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease components that are accounted for separately and not included in its leased assets and corresponding liabilities for the majority of the Company's lease agreements. The Company allocates consideration to the lease and non-lease components using their relative standalone values. The lease term may include options to extend or to terminate the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The Company has elected not to record leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor finance leases, the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. Interest expense on the lease liability is recorded separately using the interest method. For operating leases, lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLessor Accounting\nThe Company's lease offerings are non-cancelable and the payment schedule primarily consists of fixed payments. Variable payments that are based on an index are included in lease receivables. The Company allocates consideration amongst lease components and non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis, when lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations. At the end of the lease term, the Company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms.\nThe Company retains a residual position in equipment through lease and finance agreements which is equivalent to an estimated market value. The residual amount is established prior to lease inception, based upon estimated equipment values at end of lease using product road map trends, historical analysis, future projections and remarketing experience. The Company's residual amounts are evaluated at least annually to assess the appropriateness of the carrying values. Any anticipated declines in specific future residual values that are considered to be other-than-temporary would be recorded in current earnings. The Company is able to optimize the recovery of residual values by selling equipment in place, extending lease arrangements on a fixed term basis, entering into a monthly usage rental term beyond the initial lease term, and selling lease returned equipment in the secondary market. The contractual lease agreement also identifies return conditions that ensures the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return minus any normal wear and tear. During the residual review process, product changes, product updates, as well as market conditions are reviewed and adjustments if other than temporary are made to residual values in accordance with the impact of any such changes. The remarketing sales organization closely manages the sale of equipment lease returns to optimize the recovery of outstanding residual by product.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company's consolidated results prospectively from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the\n77\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nacquired entity based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative test to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a qualitative assessment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. Under the qualitative assessment, the Company is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless it determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic and industry environment as well as Company-specific factors.  The Company used the qualitative assessment for the Athonet and OpsRamp reporting units.  For, all other reporting units, the Company elects to perform a quantitative test as part of its annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.\nIn the quantitative assessment, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived solely from the market approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows covering discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations. The Company prepares cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The Company bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit).\nIntangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives, long-lived assets and ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For lease assets such circumstances would include a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset, or subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated lease. The Company assesses the recoverability of assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is impaired. The Company measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach. The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from\none\nto\nten years\n. Intangible assets purchased as part of an acquisition are included in Intangible assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All other separately purchased intangible assets are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments and ownership interests are accounted for under equity method accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with its equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis\n78\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\ndifferences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investments based on the most recently available financial statements of the investees.\nThe carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company's interest in net earnings, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. The Company reviews for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nEquity Securities Investments\nEquity securities investments with readily determinable fair values (other than those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company may elect to apply the measurement alternative or the fair value option. Under the measurement alternative investments are measured at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for qualifying observable price changes on a prospective basis. The Company reviews for impairment at each reporting period, assessing factors such as deterioration of earnings, adverse change in market/industry conditions, the ability to operate as a going concern, and other factors which indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company elects the fair value option when it believes that it best reflects the underlying economics of the investment. These investments may be valued using third-party pricing services at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Interest and other, net  in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nDebt Securities Investments\nDebt securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. When the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the Company recognizes the impairment using an allowance for credit loss in Interest and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, while the impairment that is not credit related is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivatives\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and, at times, options, to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe Company receives fair value to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability, the Company generally uses industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of derivative positions. Such measurements involve projecting future cash flows and discounting the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, Company and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices. In the absence of such data, the Company will use internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued.\nFor a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 12, “Fair Value” and Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” respectively.\n79\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nContingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record gain contingencies until realized.\nSee Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies,” for a full description of the Company's contingencies.\nWarranties\nThe Company accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of recognizing revenue. The Company's standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. The estimated warranty obligation is based on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of the Company's baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from\none\nto\nfive years\nfor parts and labor, depending upon the product. For certain networking products, the Company offers a lifetime warranty. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately\n1.1\n% of annual net product revenue.\nRefer to Note 18, “Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties” for additional information.\nRecently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements\nAlthough there are new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that the Company will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to provide disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2:\nSegment Information\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's operations are organized into\nsix\nsegments for financial reporting purposes: Compute, High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (“HPC & AI”), Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services (“FS”), and Corporate Investments and Other. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), who is the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), uses to evaluate, view and run the Company's business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The\nsix\nsegments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results. A summary of the types of products and services within each segment is as follows:\nCompute\nincludes both general purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload optimized servers to deliver the best performance and value for demanding applications.

FS also supports financial solutions for on-premise flexible consumption models, such as the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nCorporate Investments and Other\nincludes the Advisory and Professional Services (“A & PS”) business, which primarily offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation services as well as complex solution engagement capabilities; the Communications and Media Solutions business (“CMS”), which primarily offers software and related services to the telecommunications industry and includes Athonet, which provides private mobile core networks to enterprises and communication services providers; the HPE Software business, which offers the HPE Ezmeral Software Container Platform and HPE Ezmeral Software Data Fabric; OpsRamp which provides a SaaS platform for managed service providers and enterprise IT teams to monitor and manage their cloud and on-premises (“hybrid”) infrastructure; and Hewlett Packard Labs, which is responsible for research and development.\nSegment Policy\nHewlett Packard Enterprise derives the results of its business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies that Hewlett Packard Enterprise uses to derive segment results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. The CODM measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. The CODM uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to each of the segments.\nSegment revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment revenues primarily consist of sales of hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating leases by FS to the Company's customers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's consolidated net revenue is derived and reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.\nFinancing cost in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on borrowing and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries, and debt issued by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for which a portion of the proceeds benefited FS.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level. These unallocated operating costs include certain corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets,\nimpairment of goodwill, t\nransformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\n81\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nEffective November 1, 2023, in\norder to align the Company’s segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure, the Company established a new reportable segment, Hybrid Cloud which includes its historical Storage segment, HPE GreenLake Flex Solutions (which provides flexible as-a-service IT infrastructure through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and was previously reported under Compute and HPC & AI segments), Private Cloud, and Software (previously reported under Corporate Investments and Other segment). Additionally, certain products and services reported in the financial results for the HPC & AI segment through the end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Compute and Hybrid Cloud segments, and the recently acquired Athonet business and certain components of the CMS business reported in the financial results for Corporate Investments and Other through the end of fiscal 2023 will be reported in the Intelligent Edge segment. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company will report its results under the realigned\nsix\nreportable segments.\nSegment Operating Results\nThe reconciliation of segment operating results to Consolidated Statement of Earnings results was as follows:\n82\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nSegment Assets\nHewlett Packard Enterprise allocates assets to its business segments based on the segments primarily benefiting from the assets.\nTotal assets by segment and the reconciliation of segment assets to total assets as per Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nMajor Customers\nThe Company has\none customer which represented\n11\n% of the Company's total net revenue in fiscal 2023, primarily within the Intelligent Edge and Compute segments. No single customer represented 10% or more of the Company's total net revenue in fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n83\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nGeographic Information\nNet revenue by country is based upon the sales location that predominately represents the customer location. For each of the fiscal years of 2023, 2022 and 2021, other than the U.S.,\nno country represented more than 10% of the Company's net revenue.\nNet revenue by geographic region was as follows:\nProperty, plant and equipment, net by country in which the Company's operates was as follows:\nNote 3:\nTransformation Programs\nTransformation programs are comprised of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and the HPE Next Plan. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company launched the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan which focuses on realigning the workforce to areas of growth, a new hybrid workforce model called Edge-to-Office, real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy. The transformation costs predominantly related to labor restructuring, non-labor restructuring, IT investments, design and execution charges and real estate initiatives. The primary elements of the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan have been substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company launched the HPE Next Plan to put in place a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where it participates. Through this program, the Company is simplifying the operating model, and streamlining its offerings, business processes and business systems to improve its strategy execution. The primary elements of the HPE Next Plan have been substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023.\nCost Optimization and Prioritization Plan\nThe components of the transformation costs relating to the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan were as follows:\n84\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nHPE Next Plan\nThe components of transformation costs relating to HPE Next Plan were as follows:\nRestructuring Plans\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan which primarily related to labor restructuring and real estate site exits under non-labor restructuring. The changes to the workforce varied by country, based on business needs, local legal requirements and consultations with employee works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate.\nOn October 16, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the HPE Next Plan, and on September 20, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a revision to that restructuring plan. Headcount exits under the HPE Next Plan were substantially complete as of October 31, 2020. Other restructuring actions primarily related to infrastructure were substantially complete as of October 31, 2022.\nRestructuring activities related to the Company's employees and infrastructure under the Cost Optimization and Prioritization Plan and HPE Next Plan are presented in the table below:\nThe current restructuring liability related to the transformation programs, reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, was $\n180\nmillion and $\n191\nmillion, respectively, in Accrued restructuring, and $\n22\nmillion and $\n28\nmillion, respectively, in Other accrued liabilities. The non-current restructuring liability related to the transformation programs, reported in Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $\n110\nmillion and $\n124\nmillion, respectively.\nNote 4:\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans worldwide, the most significant of which are the United Kingdom (“UK”) and Germany plans. The pension plan in the UK is closed to new entrants, however, members continue to earn benefit accruals. This plan provides benefits based on final pay and years of service and generally requires contributions from members. The German pension program that is open to new hires consists of cash balance plans that provide employer credits\n85\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nas a percentage of pay, certain employee pay deferrals and employer matching contributions. There also are previously closed German pension programs that include cash balance and final average pay plans. These previously closed pension programs comprise the majority of the pension obligations in Germany.\nPost-Retirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, the most significant of which is in the U.S. Generally, employees hired before August 2008 are eligible for employer credits under the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (“RMSA”) upon attaining age 45. Employer credits to the RMSA available after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee beneficiary association. Upon retirement, employees may use these employer credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company’s defined contribution expense was approximately $\n206\nmillion, $\n196\nmillion and $\n170\nmillion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan (“HPE 401(k) Plan”), when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The HPE 401(k) Plan’s quarterly employer matching contributions are\n100\n% of an employee’s contributions, up to a maximum of\n4\n% of eligible compensation.\nPension Benefit Expense\nThe Company's net pension and post-retirement benefit costs that were directly attributable to the eligible employees, retirees and other former employees of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the table below.\n(1)\nThese non-service components were included in Non-service net periodic benefit (cost) credit in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\n86\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the net benefit cost (credit) in the table above for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(1)\nThe average assumed interest credited for HPE's cash balance plans and postretirement plans, as applicable.\nTo estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans that use the yield curve approach, which represent substantially all of the Company's defined benefit plans, the Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\n87\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFunded Status\nThe funded status of the plans was as follows:\n(1)\nFor fiscal 2023, the German Contractual Trust Arrangements reimbursed HPE for benefit payments of approximately $\n82\nmillion.\n(2)\nIncludes the addition/deletion of plans resulting from acquisitions.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2023, the benefit obligation decreased from $\n9.5\nbillion to $\n9.4\nbillion primarily due to the effects of increasing discount rates and payments of benefits reducing the obligation offset by the interest on the benefit obligation along with the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Pension assets remained flat at $\n9.9\nbillion as the reduction due to less than expected asset returns and benefits paid from plan assets was partially offset by the weakening of the U.S. dollar.\n88\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations were as follows:\nThe net amounts recognized for defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the pre-tax net actuarial loss and prior service benefit recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the defined benefit plans:\nDefined benefit plans with projected benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets were as follows:\nDefined benefit plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets were as follows:\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nThe Company pays the U.S. defined benefit plan obligations when they come due since these plans are unfunded.\nThe table below sets forth the fair value of non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets by asset category within the fair value hierarchy as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.\n89\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(1)\nRepurchase agreements, primarily in the UK, represent the plans’ short-term borrowing to hedge against interest rate and inflation risks. Investments in approximately $\n2.3\nbillion and $\n3.0\nbillion of government bonds collateralize this short-term borrowing at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The plans have an obligation to return the cash after the term of the agreements. Due to the short-term nature of the agreements, the outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair value.\n(2)\nIncludes funds that invest primarily in asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and/or private debt investments. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and broker quotes and/or 3rd party pricing services. Significant unobservable inputs include yields which are determined by considering the market yield of comparable public debt instruments adjusted for estimated losses to reflect where the expected recovery rate would be less than\n100\n%, discount rates, and internal rate of return (IRR). The yields ranged from\n6\n% to\n22\n%, with the weighted average around\n10\n%. In the prior year, the yields ranged from\n4\n% to\n18\n%, with the weighted average around\n7\n%. The discount rates ranged from\n4\n% to\n5\n%, with the weighted average around\n4\n%. In the prior year, the discount rates ranged from\n1\n% to\n5\n%, with the weighted average around\n3\n%. The IRR ranged from\n5\n% to\n21\n%, with the main weighted average around\n10\n%. In the prior year, the IRR ranged from\n4\n% to\n11\n%, with the main weighted average around\n8\n%. Generally, an increase in yield and discounted rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\n(3)\nIncludes funds, primarily in the UK, that invest in both private and public equities, as well as emerging markets across all sectors. The funds also hold fixed income and derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and inflation risk. In addition, the funds include units in transferable securities, collective investment schemes, money market funds, asset-backed income, cash, and deposits. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and book value or net asset value. Significant unobservable inputs include discount rates. The discount rates ranged from\n3\n% to\n28\n%, with the weighted average around\n14\n%. In the prior year, the discount rates ranged from\n3\n% to\n30\n%, with the weighted average around\n12\n%. Generally, an increase in discount rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\n90\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(4)\nIncludes a pooled fund in the UK, that seeks a rate of return with direct or indirect linkage to UK inflation by investing in vehicles including bonds, long lease property, income strips, asset-backed securities, and index linked assets. Units are available for subscription on the first business day of each calendar month at net asset value. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(5)\nCommon Contractual Funds (“CCFs”) are investment arrangements in which institutional investors pool their assets. Units may be acquired in four different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and emerging markets. Each sub-fund is invested in accordance with the fund's investment objective and units are issued in relation to each sub-fund. While the sub-funds are not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value either once or twice a month, depending on the sub-fund. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(6)\nIncludes funds, primarily in Germany, that invest in a diversified portfolio of European real estate assets exposed to logistics real estate properties, food retailing properties, residential and commercial properties, and properties under development. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include the income capitalization approach and cost approach. Significant unobservable inputs include rental yield and IRR. The rental yield rates ranged from\n4\n% to\n6\n%, with the weighted average around\n4\n%. In the prior year, the rental yield rates ranged from\n3\n% to\n6\n%, with the weighted average around\n4\n%. The IRR ranged from\n5\n% to\n8\n%, with the main weighted average around\n7\n%. In the prior year, the IRR ranged from\n4\n% to\n7\n%, with the main weighted average around\n6\n%. Generally, an increase in rental yield rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\n(7)\nIncludes life insurance investment policies, unsettled transactions, and derivative instruments. As of October 31, 2023, the derivative instruments include synthetic equity swaps held by the UK plans with equity exposure of $\n272\nmillion.\nAs of October 31, 2023 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $\n68\nmillion were invested in publicly traded registered investment entities of which $\n55\nmillion are classified within Level 1 and $\n13\nmillion within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As of October 31, 2022 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $\n60\nmillion were invested in publicly traded registered investment entities of which $\n48\nmillion are classified within Level 1 and $\n12\nmillion within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nChanges in fair value measurements of Level 3 investments for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as follows:\n91\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value.\nInvestments in publicly traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. For corporate, government backed debt securities, and some other investments, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions. The valuation of certain real estate funds, insurance group annuity contracts and alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment and involves a level of uncertainty. The valuation is generally based on fair value as reported by the asset manager and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by management, including, but are not limited to, the timeliness of fair value as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last fair value reported by the asset manager. The use of different techniques or assumptions to estimate fair value could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nCash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued based on cost, which approximates fair value. Other than those assets that have quoted prices from an active market, investments are generally classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety. Investments measured using net asset value as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nPlan Asset Allocations\nThe weighted-average target and actual asset allocations across the benefit plans at the respective measurement dates for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as follows:\n(1)\nIncluded in Real estate and other investments are synthetic equity swaps with equity exposure of $\n272\nmillion, which is held in the UK plans as of October 31, 2023.\nFor the Company's post-retirement benefit plans, approximately\n81\n% of the plan assets are invested in cash and cash equivalents and approximately\n19\n% in multi-asset credit investments which consists primarily of investment grade credit, emerging market debt and high yield bonds.\nInvestment Policy\nThe Company's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans’ investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans’ investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and the Company may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.\nAsset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed. The Company reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees or investment committees for the specific plan.\n92\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nBasis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns, which considers each country’s specific inflation outlook. Because the Company’s investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns, net of fees.\nEmployer Contributions and Funding Policy\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company contributed approximately $\n179\nmillion to its non-U.S. pension plans and paid $\n6\nmillion to cover benefit claims under the Company’s post-retirement benefit plans.\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company expects to contribute approximately $\n182\nmillion to its\nnon-U.S. pension plans\nand an additional $\n3\nmillion to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. In addition, the Company expects to pay approximately $\n8\nmillion to cover benefit claims for its post-retirement benefit plans. The Company's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities.\nEstimated Future Benefits Payments\nAs of October 31, 2023, estimated future benefits payments for the Company's retirement plans were as follows:\nNote 5:\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn April 14, 2021 (the “Approval Date”), shareholders of the Company approved the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) that replaced the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards including restricted stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. These awards generally vest over\n3\nyears from the grant date. The maximum number of shares as\nof the Approval Date that may be delivered to the participants under the 2021 Plan shall not exceed\n7\nmillion shares, plus\n35.8\nmillion shares that were available for grant under the 2015 Plan and any awards granted under the 2015 Plan prior to the Approval Date that were cash-settled, forfeited, terminated, or lapsed after the Approval Date. On April 5, 2022, shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2021 Plan thereby increasing the overall number of shares available for issuance by\n15\nmillion shares. As of October 31, 2023, the Company had remaining authorization of\n35.9\nmillion shares under the 2021 Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense and the resulting tax benefits were as follows:\n93\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nStock-based compensation expense as presented in the table above is recorded within the following cost and expense lines in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nEffective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The total number of shares of Company's common stock authorized under the ESPP was\n80\nmillion. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to\n10\n% of their eligible compensation to purchase Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common stock. The ESPP provides for a discount not to exceed\n15\n% and an offering period up to\n24\nmonths. The Company currently offers\n6\n-month offering periods during which employees have the ability to purchase shares at\n95\n% of the closing market price on the purchase date.\nNo\nstock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases, as the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The fair value of the restricted stock units is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company expenses the fair value of restricted stock units ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity for the year ended October 31, 2023:\nThe total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested for Company employees in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $\n319\nmillion, $\n262\nmillion and $\n271\nmillion, respectively. As of October 31, 2023, there was $\n325\nmillion of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units, which the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of\n1.3\nyears.\nPerformance Restricted Units\nThe Company issues performance stock units (“PSU”) that vest on the satisfaction of service and performance conditions. The fair value of the PSUs is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company also issues performance-adjusted restricted stock units (“PARSU”) that vest only on the satisfaction of service, performance and market conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of PARSUs subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The expenses associated with these performance restricted units were not material for any of the periods presented.\n94\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nStock Options\nStock options granted under the Plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the Plan permits some options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the option grant date. The majority of the stock options issued by the Company contain only service vesting conditions. The Company has also issued performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions. The Company did not issue stock options in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Stock options assumed through acquisitions were not material for fiscal 2023. The expenses associated with stock options were not material for any of the periods presented.\nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based vesting conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model, as these awards contain market conditions.\nNote 6:\nTaxes on Earnings\nProvision for Taxes\nThe domestic and foreign components of Net earnings from operations before taxes were as follows:\nForeign earnings in fiscal 2021 were higher as compared to fiscal 2023 and 2022, primarily as a result of the income from the Itanium litigation judgment.\nThe Provision for taxes on Net earnings from operations were as follows:\n95\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate were as follows:\nThe jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on the Company's effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company recorded $\n131\nmillion of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $\n104\nmillion of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges and $\n19\nmillion of net excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $\n454\nmillion of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $\n150\nmillion of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances, $\n99\nmillion of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $\n43\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters, $\n42\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the release of U.S. passive foreign tax credit valuation allowances, $\n30\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc., $\n27\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the utilization of capital losses which had a full valuation allowance, $\n12\nmillion of income tax benefits as a result of the fiscal 2021 U.S. tax return filing primarily from the decrease in GILTI, and $\n11\nmillion of net income tax benefits related to settlements and ongoing discussions in foreign tax audit matters.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company recorded $\n294\nmillion of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $\n180\nmillion of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $\n157\nmillion of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances, $\n39\nmillion of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes, and $\n32\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc. These benefits were partially offset by $\n337\nmillion of net income tax charges associated with income from the Itanium litigation judgment, against which $\n244\nmillion of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $\n93\nmillion.\nAs a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates through 2039. The gross foreign income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were $\n857\nmillion ($\n0.65\ndiluted net EPS) in fiscal 2023, $\n832\nmillion ($\n0.63\ndiluted net EPS) in fiscal 2022, and $\n889\nmillion ($\n0.67\ndiluted net EPS) in fiscal 2021. Refer to Note 16, “Net Earnings Per Share” for details on shares used to compute diluted net EPS.\n96\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nUp to $\n354\nmillion, $\n386\nmillion and $\n688\nmillion of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, would affect its effective tax rate if realized in their respective periods. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company effectively settled with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2016, primarily contributing to the reduction in the Company's unrecognized tax benefits of $\n1.5\nbillion, which was predominantly related to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition which does not affect the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company recognized $\n25\nmillion and $\n55\nmillion of interest income and $\n17\nmillion of interest expense in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had accrued $\n56\nmillion and $\n81\nmillion, respectively, for interest and penalties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately\n85\nother countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.\nThe Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audits for years prior to 2017. The IRS is conducting audits of the Company's fiscal 2017 through 2022 U.S. federal income tax returns. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments (“NOPAs”) for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 relating to HPE’s intercompany transfer pricing. After the close of fiscal 2023, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) finalizing their position on the NOPAs for the same issues and same fiscal years. The IRS is seeking to increase taxable income across the three fiscal years by $\n904\nmillion. As of the balance sheet date, HPE has sufficient tax credit carryforwards to offset any incremental tax liability from the adjustments in the RAR. However, HPE disagrees with the IRS’ adjustments and believes the positions taken on its tax returns are more likely than not to prevail on technical merits, and the Company will defend these positions through the IRS administrative processes, as necessary. Accordingly, no changes have been made to the Company’s reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023 relating to the IRS’ adjustments. With respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2005. However, it is reasonably possible that certain foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next\n12\nmonths, including issues involving resolution of certain intercompany transactions and other matters. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to $\n16\nmillion within the next\n12\nmonths.\nThe Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company's tax provision. The Company adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the\n97\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\namounts previously included in the Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net earnings or cash flows.\nThe Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on $\n9.4\nbillion of undistributed earnings and basis differences from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2023 because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings and basis differences is not practicable. The Company will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and the Company determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows:\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\n98\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of October 31, 2023, the Company had $\n386\nmillion, $\n3.1\nbillion and $\n20.2\nbillion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. Amounts included in state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024; federal net operating losses can carry forward indefinitely. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of $\n147\nmillion and $\n3.9\nbillion for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign net operating losses carryforwards, respectively. As of October 31, 2023, the Company also had $\n13\nmillion, $\n5.6\nbillion, and $\n85\nmillion of federal, state, and foreign capital loss carryforwards, respectively. Amounts included in federal and state capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028; foreign capital losses can carry forward indefinitely. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of $\n7\nmillion and $\n25\nmillion for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign capital loss carryforwards, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2023\n, the Company had recorded deferred tax assets for various tax credit carryforwards as follows:\nTotal valuation allowances decreased by $\n1.5\nbillion in fiscal 2023, primarily from the expiration of U.S. federal capital loss carryforwards.\nTax Matters Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters\nIn connection with the completed separations and mergers of the former Enterprise Services business with DXC Technology Company (“DXC”) (the “Everett Transaction” or “Everett”) and the Software Segment with Micro Focus International plc (“Micro Focus”) (the “Seattle Transaction” or “Seattle”), the Company entered into a DXC Tax Matters Agreement with DXC and a Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement with Micro Focus, respectively. See Note 18, “Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties,” for a description of the DXC Tax Matters Agreement and Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement.\nNote 7:\nBalance Sheet Details\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAccounts Receivable, Net\n99\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable and changes therein were as follows:\nThe Company has third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. The Company recorded an obligation of $\n80\nmillion, $\n88\nmillion and $\n65\nmillion in Notes payable and short-term borrowings in its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the trade receivables sold and collected from the third-party for which the revenue recognition was deferred. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured using market data from similar transactions and reported as a current liability in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe activity related to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's revolving short-term financing arrangements was as follows:\n(1)\nBeginning and ending balances represent amounts for trade receivables sold but not yet collected.\nInventory\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\n(1)\nThis balance includes $\n606\nmillion and $\n534\nmillion of internal use software, net as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n100\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDepreciation expense was $\n2.3\nbillion, $\n2.2\nbillion, and $\n2.2\nbillion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLong-Term Financing Receivables and Other Assets\nOther Accrued Liabilities\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nContract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations\nAs of October 31, 2023 and 2022, current deferred revenue of $\n3.6\nbillion and $\n3.4\nbillion, respectively, were recorded in Deferred revenue, and non-current deferred revenue of $\n3.3\nbillion and $\n3.0\nbillion, respectively, were recorded in Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During fiscal 2023, approximately $\n3.4\nbillion\nof d\neferred revenue as of October 31, 2022 was recognized as revenue.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract work that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts where the customer is not committed. Remaining performance obligations estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including contract terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, adjustments for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency. As of October 31, 2023, the Company expects to recognize\n101\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\napproximately\n49\n% of the aggregate amount of remaining performance obligations, or deferred revenue, of $\n6.9\nbillion revenue over the next\ntwelve months\nwith the remainder to be recognized thereafter.\nCosts to obtain a Contract\nAs of October 31, 2023, the current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $\n86\nmillion and $\n138\nmillion, respectively. As of October 31, 2022, the current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $\n76\nmillion and $\n124\nmillion, respectively. The current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were included in Other current assets, and Long-term financing receivables and other assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company amortized $\n94\nmillion and $\n83\nmillion, respectively, of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract which are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nNote 8:\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessee\nComponents of lease cost included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were as follows:\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company recorded $\n85\nmillion of net gain from sale and leaseback transactions.\nThe ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n102\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate for the operating and finance leases were as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nThe following tables shows the future payments on the Company's operating and finance leases:\nAs of October 31, 2023, the Company entered into $\n516\nmillion of operating leases that have not yet commenced and are not yet recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These operating leases are scheduled to commence during fiscal 2024 and contain lease terms from\n5\nto\n10\nyears.\nNote 9:\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessor\nFinancing Receivables\nFinancing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases of the Company and third-party products. These receivables typically have terms ranging from\ntwo\nto\nfive years\nand are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating leases. The allowance for credit losses represents future expected credit losses over the life of the receivables based on past experience, current information and forward-looking economic considerations.\nThe components of financing receivables were as follows:\n103\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of October 31, 2023, scheduled maturities of the Company's minimum lease payments receivable were as follows:\nSale of Financing Receivables\nThe Company entered into arrangements to transfer the contractual payments due under certain financing receivables to third party financial institutions. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company sold $\n237\nmillion and $\n183\nmillion, respectively, of financing receivables.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nDue to the homogeneous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk ratings to each lease based on the creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction and periodically updates the risk ratings when there is a change in the underlying credit quality. Such variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.\n104\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2023, presented on an amortized cost basis by year of origination was as follows:\nThe credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2022, was as follows:\nAccounts rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB– or higher, while accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent of BB+ or lower. The Company classifies accounts as high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a significant near-term risk of impairment. The credit quality indicators do not reflect any mitigation actions taken to transfer credit risk to third parties.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses for financing receivables and changes therein were as follows:\n(1)\nFiscal 2022 included a provision of $\n99\nmillion related to expected credit losses due to the Company's exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses.\n105\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNon-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables\nThe following table summarizes the aging and non-accrual status of gross financing receivables:\n(1)\nIncludes billed operating lease receivables and billed sales-type and direct-financing lease receivables.\n(2)\nIncludes billed operating lease receivables and billed and unbilled sales-type and direct-financing lease receivables.\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease assets included in Property, plant and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2023, minimum future rentals on non-cancelable operating leases related to leased equipment were as follows:\nIf a lease is classified as an operating lease, the Company records lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At commencement of an operating lease, initial direct costs are deferred and are expensed over the lease term on the same basis as the lease revenue is recorded.\n106\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following table presents amounts included in the Consolidated\nStatements of\nEarnings related to lessor activity:\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company has issued asset-backed debt securities under a fixed-term securitization program to private investors. The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized by the U.S. fixed-term financing receivables and leased equipment in the offering, which is held by a Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”). The SPE meets the definition of a VIE and is consolidated, along with the associated debt, into the Consolidated Financial Statements as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The SPE is a bankruptcy-remote legal entity with separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPE is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables and leased equipment in the capital markets.\nThe Company's risk of loss related to securitized receivables and leased equipment is limited to the amount by which the Company's right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities.\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIE as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe assets in the table below include those that can be used to settle the obligations of the VIE. Additionally, general creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the VIE.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2023, financing receivables and leased equipment transferred via securitization through the SPE were $\n0.8\nbillion and $\n0.7\nbillion, respectively. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, financing receivables and leased equipment transferred via securitization through the SPE were $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion, respectively.\nNote 10:\nAcquisitions\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2023\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed\nfive\nacquisitions. The purchase price allocations for the acquisitions described below reflect various preliminary fair value estimates and analysis, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, of certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes, and residual goodwill, which are subject to change within the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments are recorded in the reporting period in which the estimates are finalized and adjustment amounts are determined.\nThe pro forma results of operations, revenue and net income subsequent to the acquisition dates have not been presented as they are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. Goodwill,\n107\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nwhich represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe following table presents the aggregate estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those items that are still pending allocations, for the acquisitions completed during fiscal 2023:\nOn May 2, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of OpsRamp, an IT operations management company that monitors, observes, automates, and manages IT infrastructure, cloud resources, workloads, and applications for hybrid and multi-cloud environments, including the leading hyperscalers. OpsRamp’s results of operations were included within the Corporate Investments and Other segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $\n307\nmillion primarily consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $\n217\nmillion of goodwill, and $\n84\nmillion of intangible assets. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of\n5\nyears.\nOn March 15, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Axis Security, a cloud security provider, enabling the Company to expand its edge-to-cloud security capabilities by offering a unified Secure Access Services Edge solution to meet the increasing demand for integrated networking and security solutions delivered aaS. Axis Security's results of operations were included within the Intelligent Edge segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $\n412\nmillion primarily consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $\n311\nmillion of goodwill, and $\n71\nmillion of intangible assets. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of\n5\nyears.\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2022\nThe Company did not have any acquisitions during fiscal 2022.\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company completed\nfour\nacquisitions, none of which were material, both individually and in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the aggregate final purchase price allocation for the Company's acquisitions during fiscal 2021:\nOn August 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection. Zerto's results of operations were included within the Storage segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $\n416\nmillion primarily consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock and vested in-the-money stock awards. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $\n214\nmillion of goodwill, and $\n212\nmillion of intangible assets after considering the measurement period adjustments. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of\nseven years\n.\n108\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 11:\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill and related changes in the carrying amount by reportable segment were as follows:\n(1)\nGoodwill is net of accumulated impairment losses of $\n1.9\nbillion. Of this amount, $\n1.7\nbillion relates to HPC & AI of which $\n815\nmillion was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Software reporting unit within Corporate Investments and Other, has an accumulated impairment loss of $\n90\nmillion which was also recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n(2)\nAs a result of the organizational realignments which were effective as of November 1, 2022, (described in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"), $\n160\nmillion of goodwill was reallocated from the Storage segment to the Compute segment as of the beginning of the period using a relative fair value approach.\nGoodwill Impairments\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other which contains\nfive\nreporting units: A & PS, Athonet, legacy CMS, OpsRamp, and Software.\nThe Company’s fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in any impairment. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately\n5\n% to\n218\n% of the respective carrying amounts.\nThe Compute reporting unit has goodwill of $\n7.7\nbillion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of\n5\n% as of the annual test date. The Compute business is facing challenges reflected in the results for October 31, 2023. The Compute business is cyclical in nature. Over the last several years, digital transformation drove increased investment to modernize infrastructure. However, in the current macroeconomic and inflationary environment, customers have slowed their investments resulting in lower server demand and competitive pricing. These dynamics are further compounded by higher supply chain costs. During this cycle, the Compute business continues to focus on capturing market share while maintaining operating margin.\nThe HPC & AI reporting unit has goodwill of $\n2.9\nbillion as of October 31, 2023, and excess of fair value over carrying value of\n12\n% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business continues to face challenges related to supply chain constraints of key components and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. We currently believe these challenges will be successfully addressed as the supply chain constraints continue to improve.\nThe Company’s fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill related to the HPC & AI and Software reporting units. There was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting units.\nThe decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit below its carrying value resulted from changes in expected future cash flows due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges as well as an increase in cost of capital. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $\n815\nmillion was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $\n90\nmillion was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nBased on the results of the Company's interim and annual impairment tests in fiscal 2021, the Company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed.\n109\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets from acquisitions comprise:\nFor fiscal 2023, the decrease in gross intangible assets was due primarily to $\n326\nmillion of intangible assets which became fully amortized and were eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization, partially offset by $\n209\nmillion of intangible assets related to acquisitions.\nAs of October 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2023, estimated future amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was as follows:\nNote 12:\nFair Value\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.\n110\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n(1)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities with carrying values that approximate fair value.\nValuation Techniques\nCash Equivalents and Investments:\nThe Company holds time deposits, money market funds, debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds. The Company values cash equivalents using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt and equity investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data. Equity and other securities include investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. In evaluating non-marketable securities for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.\nDerivative Instruments:\nThe Company uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, the Company and counterparties' credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest rates. See Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” for a further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nShort-Term and Long-Term Debt: T\nhe Company estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its own credit risk. The portion of the Company's\n111\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\ndebt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. As of October 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term de\nbt was\n$\n12.2\nbillion and\nthe carrying value was $\n12.4\nbillion. As of October 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $\n12.2\nbillion and the carrying value was $\n12.5\nbillion. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short-term and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nOther Financial Instruments:\nFor the balance of the Company's financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short nature. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements\nEquity Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Value:\nEquity Investments are recorded at cost and measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a net unrealized loss of $\n45\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion, respectively, which included impairments of $\n50\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion for the same respective periods. For fiscal 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $\n64\nmillion and\nno\nimpairment charges on these investments. These amounts are reflected in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These adjustments are based on observable price changes for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair value. For investments still held as of October 31, 2023, the cumulative upward adjustments for observable price changes was $\n33\nmillion and\ncumulative downward adjustments\nfor observable price changes and impairments was $\n72\nmillion. Refer to Note 13 “Financial Instruments,” for further information about equity investments.\nNon-Financial Assets:\nThe Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost. The Company records ROU assets based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fair value adjustments are made to these non-financial assets in the period an impairment charge is recognized.\nIn fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a ROU asset impairment charge of $\n18\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion, respectively, in Transformation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as the carrying value of certain ROU assets exceeded its fair value. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n905\nmillion associated with the HPC & AI reporting unit and the Software reporting unit within the Corporate Investments and Other segment. The fair value of the Company's reporting units was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. For more information on the goodwill impairment, see Note 11, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets.”\n112\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 13:\nFinancial Instruments\nCash Equivalents and Available-for-Sale Investments\nCash equivalents and available-for-sale investments were as follows:\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately $\n127\nmillion, $\n39\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of October 31, 2023 and 2022. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.\nContractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:\nEquity Investments\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately held companies are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These non-marketable equity investments are carried either at fair value or under the measurement alternative.\nThe carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative was $\n145\nmillion and $\n175\nmillion as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a net unrealized loss of $\n45\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion, respectively, which included impairments of $\n50\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion for the same respective periods. For fiscal 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of  $\n64\nmillion and\nno\nimpairment charges on these investments.\nThe carrying amount of those\nnon-marketable equity investments\naccounted for under the fair value option was $\n135\nmillion and $\n126\nmillion as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded net unrealized gains of $\n9\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion, respectively, on these investments. In fiscal 2022, the Company sold $\n165\nmillion of these investments.\n113\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. The Company's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Company does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment hedges”). Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income depending upon the type of hedge as further discussed below. The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs a result of its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors, and the Company maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating and other factors. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Master netting agreements also mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting the Company to net amounts due from the Company to a counterparty against amounts due to the Company from the same counterparty under certain conditions.\nTo further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, the Company has collateral security agreements, which allows the Company to hold collateral from, or require the Company to post collateral to counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of the Company and its counterparties. If the Company's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the counterparty has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Conversely, if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the Company has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Collateral is generally posted within\ntwo\nbusiness days. The fair value of the Company's derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $\n108\nmillion and $\n106\nmillion at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, most of which were fully collateralized within\ntwo\nbusiness days.\nUnder the Company's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting the Company that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect the Company's financial position or cash flows as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. The Company may enter into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest rate which was replaced with SOFR starting in July of fiscal 2023. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair value hedges.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally\n114\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nwithin\ntwelve months\n; however, forward contracts associated with sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which can extend up to\nfive years\n.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, and as long as they remain highly effective, the Company records the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the same financial statement line item when the hedged transaction is recognized.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the changes in the fair value of the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.\nFor derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nHedge Effectiveness\nFor interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged items with the change in fair value of the derivative. For forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.\n115\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nThe gross notional and fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:\nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments\nThe Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements. The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash collateral posted under collateral security agreements.\nAs of October 31, 2023 and 2022, information related to the potential effect of the Company's use of the master netting agreements and collateral security agreements was as follows:\n116\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(1)\nRepresents the cash collateral posted by counterparties as of the respective reporting date for the Company's asset position, net of derivative amounts that could be offset, as of, generally,\ntwo\nbusiness days prior to the respective reporting date.\n(2)\nRepresents the collateral posted by the Company in cash or through re-use of counterparty cash collateral as of the respective reporting date for the Company's liability position, net of derivative amounts that could be offset, as of, generally,\ntwo\nbusiness days prior to the respective reporting date. As of October 31, 2023, of the $\n103\nmillion of collateral posted,  $\n56\nmillion was in cash and $\n47\nmillion was through the re-use of counterparty collateral. As of October 31, 2022, the entire amount of the collateral posted of $\n113\nmillion was through re-use of counterparty collateral.\nThe amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges were as follows:\nThe pre-tax effect of derivative instruments in cash flow and net investment hedging relationships recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2023, the Company expects to reclassify an estimated net accumulated other comprehensive gain of approximately $\n71\nmillion, net of taxes, to earnings in the next twelve months along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions associated with cash flow hedges.\n117\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nEffect of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings\nThe following table represents pre-tax effect of derivative instruments on total amounts of income and expense line items presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in which the effects of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded:\nNote 14:\nBorrowings\nNotes Payable and Short-Term Borrowings\nNotes payable and short-term borrowings, including the current portion of long-term debt, were as follows:\n(1)\nAs of October 31, 2023, the Current portion of long-term debt, net of discount and issuance costs, included $\n1.4\nbillion associated with the current portion of the Company issued asset-backed debt securities.\n118\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nLong-Term Debt\n(1)\nOther, including finance lease obligations included $\n36\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries that are collateralized by receivables and underlying assets associated with the related finance and operating leases. For both the periods presented, the carrying amount of the assets approximated the carrying amount of the borrowings.\n119\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nInterest expense on borrowings recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was as follows:\nAs disclosed in Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” the Company used interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of its fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with its variable-rate debt. Interest rates on long-term debt in the table above have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps.\nCommercial Paper\nHewlett Packard Enterprise maintains\ntwo\ncommercial paper programs, “the Parent Programs,” and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. The Parent Program in the U.S. provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $\n4.75\nbillion. The Parent Program outside the U.S. provides for the issuance of commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $\n3.0\nbillion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those two programs at any one time cannot exceed the $\n4.75\nbillion as authorized by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Board of Directors. In addition, the Hewlett Packard Enterprise subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Program provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $\n1.0\nbillion. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under the Parent Programs. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, $\n679\nmillion and $\n542\nmillion, respectively, were outstanding under the subsidiary’s program.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Company maintains a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was entered into in December 2021, with an aggregate lending commitment of $\n4.75\nbillion for a period of\nfive years\n. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under either credit facility.\nUncommitted Credit facility\nOn September 21, 2023, the Company entered into a\nfive-year\nagreement with Societe Generale for an uncommitted short-term cash advance facility in the principal amount of up to $\n500\nmillion. As of October 31, 2023,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under this credit facility.\nFuture Maturities of Borrowings\nAs of October 31, 2023, aggregate future maturities of the Company's borrowings at face value (excluding a fair value adjustment related to hedged debt of $\n151\nmillion, a net discount of $\n4\nmillion and unamortized debt issuance costs of $\n30\nmillion), including finance lease obligations were as follows:\n120\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 15:\nStockholders' Equity\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes as of October 31, 2023 and changes during fiscal 2023 were as follows:\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes as of October 31, 2022 and changes during fiscal 2022 were as follows:\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes as of October 31, 2021 and changes during fiscal 2021 were as follows:\nDividends\nThe stockholders of HPE common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by HPE's Board of Directors. Dividends declared were $\n0.48\nper common share in both fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nOn November 28, 2023, the Company declared a regular cash dividend of $\n0.13\nper share on the Company's common stock, payable on January 11, 2024, to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 13, 2023.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn October 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with a $\n3.0\nbillion authorization, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $\n3.0\nbillion, $\n5.0\nbillion and $\n2.5\nbillion\n121\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\non May 24, 2016, October 16, 2017 and February 21, 2018, respectively. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions.\nIn fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased and settled a total of\n27.2\nmillion shares under its share repurchase program through open market repurchases, which included\n0.3\nmillion shares that were unsettled open market repurchases as of October 31, 2022.  Additionally, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of\n0.2\nmillion shares as of October 31, 2023. Shares repurchased during the fiscal 2023 were recorded as a $\n0.4\nbillion reduction to stockholders' equity. As of October 31, 2023, the Company had a remaining authorization of approximately $\n1.0\nbillion for future share repurchases.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased and settled a total of\n35.4\nmillion shares under its share repurchase program through open market repurchases, which included\n0.8\nmillion shares that were unsettled open market repurchases as of October 31, 2021.  Additionally, the Company had unsettled open market repurchases of\n0.3\nmillion shares as of October 31, 2022. Shares repurchased during the fiscal 2022 were recorded as a $\n0.5\nbillion reduction to stockholders' equity.\nNote 16:\nNet Earnings Per Share\nThe Company calculates basic net EPS using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net EPS includes the weighted-average dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and performance-based awards.\nThe reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of each of the basic and diluted net EPS calculations were as follows:\n(1)\nThe Company excludes shares potentially issuable under employee stock plans that could dilute basic net EPS in the future from the calculation of diluted net earnings per share, as their effect, if included, would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented.\nNote 17:\nLitigation and Contingencies\nHewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits, and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”) entered into in connection with Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s spin-off from HP Inc. (formerly known as “Hewlett-Packard Company”) (the “Separation”), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement included provisions that allocate liability and financial responsibility for pending litigation involving the parties, as well as provide for cross-indemnification of the parties against liabilities to one party arising out of liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the Separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and\n122\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nevents pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2023, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in its financial statements.\nLitigation, Proceedings and Investigations\nRoss and Rogus v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.\nOn November 8, 2018, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara alleging that HPE pays its California-based female employees “systemically lower compensation” than HPE pays male employees performing substantially similar work. The complaint alleges various California state law claims, including California’s Equal Pay Act, Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Unfair Competition Law, and seeks certification of a California-only class of female employees employed in certain “Covered Positions.” The parties subsequently reached an agreement to resolve this class action. The terms of the settlement are reflected in Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement and Certification of Settlement Class, which was filed with the Court on September 26, 2022. On November 3, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion and preliminarily approved the terms of the class settlement, which defines the settlement class as all “[w]omen actively employed in California by Defendant at any point from November 1, 2015, through the date of Preliminary Approval” who were employed in a covered job code. The settlement class excludes certain individuals, including those who previously executed an arbitration agreement with HPE or an agreement that resulted in a release or waiver of claims. On April 28, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Final Approval of the Class Action Settlement and Certification of the Settlement Class. The Court has scheduled a compliance hearing for February 8, 2024, to assess the distribution of the settlement fund to the class members and resolve any final issues.\nIndia Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings\n.\nOn April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the “DRI”) issued notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd (“HP India”), a subsidiary of HP Inc.,\nseven\nHP India employees and\none\nformer HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $\n370\nmillion, plus penalties.\nOn April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related notices affirming  duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals for approximately $\n386\nmillion. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the spare parts-related notice affirming duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals for approximately $\n17\nmillion.\nHP India filed appeals of the Commissioner’s orders before the Customs Tribunal. The Customs Department filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP India's request to return the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings before the Customs Tribunal were subsequently delayed, have been postponed on several occasions since 2014, and have not yet been rescheduled.\nECT Proceedings\n.\nIn January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos (“ECT”), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil (“HP Brazil”) that it had initiated administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies allegedly coordinated their bids and fixed results for\nthree\nECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT for\nfive years\n, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT’s decision revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case, which was denied. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from\nfive\nto\ntwo years\n. HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of the case. HP Brazil expects a resolution of the decision on the merits to take several years.\nForsyth, et al. vs. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nThis purported class and collective action was filed on August 18, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard\n123\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nEnterprise (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging Defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the California Business and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide collective action under the ADEA comprised of individuals aged 40 years and older who had their employment terminated by an HP entity pursuant to a work force reduction (“WFR”) plan. Plaintiffs also seek to certify a class under California law consisting of all persons\n40\nyears or older employed by Defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18, 2012. On April 14, 2021, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Class Certification was granted. The conditionally certified collective action consists of all individuals who had their employment terminated by Defendants pursuant to a WFR Plan on or after November 1, 2015, and who were 40 years or older at the time of such termination. The collective action excludes all individuals who signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement or an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. The parties have reached an agreement to resolve this matter.  Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Approval of the Class Action and Collective Action Settlement on September 21, 2023. On November 3, 2023, the Court issued an order granting preliminary approval to the Class Action and Collective Action Settlement. The Court has scheduled a Fairness Hearing to address the parties’ Motion for Final Approval for March 28, 2024.\nOracle America, Inc., et al. v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (Terix copyright matter)\n.\nOn March 22, 2016, Oracle filed a complaint against HPE in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging copyright infringement, interference with contract, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and unfair competition. Oracle’s claims arise out of HPE's prior use of a third-party maintenance provider named Terix Computer Company, Inc. (“Terix”). Oracle contends that in connection with HPE's use of Terix as a subcontractor for certain customers of HPE's multivendor support business, Oracle’s copyrights were infringed, and HPE is liable for vicarious and contributory infringement and related claims. Trial began on May 23, 2022. On June 15, 2022, the jury returned its verdict, awarding $\n30\nmillion in compensatory damages to Oracle and rejecting Oracle’s request for punitive damages. The parties have since reached an agreement to resolve this dispute. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the case has been dismissed and the matter is closed.\nQ3 Networking Litigation.\nOn September 21 and September 22, 2020, Q3 Networking LLC filed complaints against HPE, Aruba Networks, Commscope and Netgear in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”). Both complaints allege infringement of\nfour\npatents, and the ITC complaint defines the “accused products” as “routers, access points, controllers, network management servers, other networking products, and hardware and software components thereof.” The ITC action was instituted on October 23, 2020. The District of Delaware action has been stayed pending resolution of the ITC action. On December 7, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination finding no violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act. On May 3, 2022, the ITC issued its Notice of Final Determination, affirming the initial determination and terminating the investigation. On June 18, 2022, Q3 Networking filed a petition for review of the ITC ruling with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nShared Litigation with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus\nAs part of the Separation and Distribution Agreements between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and DXC, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Seattle SpinCo, the parties to each agreement agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreements also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. (in the case of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Inc.) or of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (in the case of the separation of DXC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the separation of Seattle SpinCo from Hewlett Packard Enterprise), in each case arising prior to the applicable separation.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company's operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; supply chain due diligence, and sustainability, environment, and emissions-related reporting; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of contaminated sites; product compliance and safety; the energy consumption of products, services, and operations; and the operational or financial responsibility for recycling, treatment, and disposal of those products. This includes legislation that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, subject to certain repairability requirements or financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as “product take-back legislation”). The Company could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, including those\n124\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nrelated to addressing climate change and other environmental related issues, or if its products become non-compliant with such environmental laws. The Company's potential exposure includes impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.\nIn particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), known as “Superfund,” or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations addressing the clean-up of contaminated sites, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also contractually obligated to make financial contributions to address actions related to certain environmental liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc.\nNote 18:\nGuarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote.\nThe Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company's non-performance under the contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. The Company believes the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The Company also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company's software products and support services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.\nGeneral Cross-indemnifications\nIn connection with the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus respectively, whereby the Company agreed to indemnify HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions. Similarly, HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus agreed to indemnify the Company, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions.\nTax Matters Agreement with DXC/Micro Focus and Other Income Tax Matters\nIn connection with the Everett Transaction and the Seattle Transaction, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with DXC and Micro Focus respectively (the “DXC Tax Matters Agreement” and the “Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement”). The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement govern the rights and obligations of the Company and DXC/Micro Focus for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables. The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement generally provide that the Company will be responsible for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be entitled to pre-divestiture tax receivables that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the Company's and DXC's, or Micro Focus', as applicable, U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain\n125\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\njurisdictions, the Company and DXC/Micro Focus have joint and several liability for past tax liabilities and accordingly, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.\nIn addition, if the distribution of Everett's or Seattle's common shares to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stockholders is determined to be taxable, the Company would generally bear the tax liability, unless the taxability of the distribution is the direct result of actions taken by DXC/Micro Focus, in which case DXC/Micro Focus would be responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.\nAs of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's receivable and payable balances related to indemnified litigation matters and other contingencies, and income tax-related indemnification covered by these agreements were as follows:\n(1)\nThe actual amount that the Company may receive or pay could vary depending upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.\nWarranties\nThe Company's aggregate product warranty liabilities and changes therein were as follows:\n(1)\nThe Company included the current portion in Other accrued liabilities, and amounts due after one year in Other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 19:\nCommitments\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nAs of October 31, 2023, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $\n1.6\nbillion. These unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction, as well as settlements that the Company has reached with third parties, requiring it to pay determined amounts over a specified period of time. These unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. The Company expects the commitments to total $\n580\nmillion, $\n293\nmillion, $\n317\nmillion, $\n310\nmillion, $\n46\nmillion, and $\n5\nmillion for fiscal years 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and thereafter, respectively.\n126\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 20:\nEquity Method Investments\nThe Company includes investments which are accounted for using the equity method, under Investments in equity interests on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's Investments in equity interests was  $\n2.2\nbillion and primarily related to a\n49\n% equity interest in H3C Technologies Co., Limited (“H3C”).\nPursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement among the Company’s relevant subsidiaries, Unisplendour International Technology Limited (“UNIS”), and H3C dated as of May 1, 2016, as amended from time to time, and most recently on October 28, 2022, the Company delivered a notice to UNIS on December 30, 2022, to exercise its right to put to UNIS, for cash consideration, all of the H3C shares held by the Company, which represent\n49\n% of the total issued share capital of H3C. On May 26, 2023, the Company’s relevant subsidiaries entered into a Put Share Purchase Agreement with UNIS, whereby UNIS has agreed to purchase all of the H3C shares held by the Company, through its subsidiaries, for total pre-tax cash consideration of $\n3.5\nbillion. The disposition remains subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and completion of certain conditions necessary for closing.\nFor the periods presented, the Company recorded its interest in the net earnings of H3C, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP on a one-month lag, along with an adjustment to eliminate unrealized profits on intra-entity sales, and the amortization of basis difference, within Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe difference between the sale date carrying value of the Company's investment in H3C and its proportionate share of the net assets fair value of H3C, created a basis difference of $\n2.5\nbillion, which was allocated as follows:\nThe Company amortizes the basis difference over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to this difference. The weighted-average life of the H3C intangible assets is\nfive years\nand is being amortized using the straight-line method. As of October 31, 2023, the difference between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investment is $\n1,677\nmillion. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company determined that\nno\nimpairment of its equity method investments existed.\nEarnings from equity interests\nThe Company recorded earnings from equity interests of $\n245\nmillion, $\n215\nmillion and $\n180\nmillion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the components of which are as follows:\n(1)\nFor fiscal 2023, earnings (loss) from equity interests, net of taxes include $\n244\nmillion, which reflected the Company’s portion of intangible asset impairment charges of $(\n8\n) million, from H3C and $(\n2\n) million  from other venture investments. For fiscal 2022, and 2021 earnings (loss) from equity interests, net of taxes included $\n275\nmillion and $\n260\nmillion from H3C and $(\n5\n) million and $\n32\nmillion from other venture investments, respectively.\n127\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company received a cash dividend of $\n200\nmillion and $\n197\nmillion, respectively, from H3C. This amount was accounted for as a return on investment and reflected as a reduction in the carrying balance of the Company's Investments in equity interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company also has commercial arrangements with H3C to buy and sell HPE branded servers, storage and networking products and services. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, HPE recorded approximately $\n383\nmillion, $\n848\nmillion and $\n794\nmillion of sales to H3C and $\n125\nmillion, $\n148\nmillion and $\n150\nmillion of purchases from H3C, respectively. Payables due to H3C as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n10\nmillion and $\n22\nmillion, respectively. Receivables due from H3C as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $\n12\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively.\nA summary of H3C’s statements of operations for the twelve-month periods ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and balance sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n128"

On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) updated General License 1B (“General License 1B”) which generally authorizes U.S. companies to engage in certain licensing, permitting, certification, notification, and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, distribution, or use of information technology products in the Russian Federation. Our local Russian subsidiary (“HPE Russia”) may be required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and to file documents. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by HPE with the FSB and all such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B. We plan to continue these activities as required to support our orderly and managed wind down of our Russia operations.\nOn April 15, 2021, the U.S. Government issued an executive order on Blocking Property with Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation (“Executive Order 14024”), implementing additional U.S. sanctions against the Russian government and against Russian actors that threaten U.S. interests, including certain technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Service. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (“Positive Technologies”) under Executive Order 14024 and Executive Order 13382. HPE Russia had dealings with Positive Technologies prior to its designation. Following the sanctions designation, HPE Russia immediately initiated procedures to terminate its relationship with Positive Technologies. HPE does not plan to engage in any further transactions with this entity, except wind down activities that are authorized by OFAC going forward. HPE Russia continues to have blocked property associated with Positive Technologies. No action will be taken unless and until a license is received from OFAC authorizing collection of the property. There are no identifiable gross revenues or net profits associated with HPE’s activities related to Positive Technologies for this reporting period.\n129\nFor a summary of our revenue recognition policies, see “Revenue Recognition” described in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II."
