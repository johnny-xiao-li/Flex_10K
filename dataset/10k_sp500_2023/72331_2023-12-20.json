    "text": "General Description of Business\nNordson is an innovative precision technology company that leverages a scalable growth framework to deliver top tier growth with leading margins and returns. We engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used for precision dispensing, applying and controlling of adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces and various medical products such as: catheters, cannulas, medical balloons and medical tubing. These products are supported with extensive application expertise and direct global sales and service. We serve a wide variety of consumer non-durable, consumer durable and technology end markets including packaging, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, precision agriculture, building and construction, and general product assembly and finishing.\nOur strategy for long-term growth is based on solving customers’ needs globally. We were incorporated in the State of Ohio in 1954 and are headquartered in Westlake, Ohio. Our products are marketed through a network of direct operations in more than 35 countries. Consistent with this global strategy, approximately 66 percent of our revenues were generated outside the United States in 2023.\nWe have 7,900 employees worldwide. Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nARAG Acquisition\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the ARAG Group and its subsidiaries (\"ARAG Group\" or \"ARAG\") pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2023, by and among the Company, its Italian subsidiary, Capvis Equity V LP (\"Capvis\"), DRIP Co-Investment (\"DRIP\"), and certain individuals (together with Capvis and DRIP, collectively, the \"Sellers\"). ARAG is a global market and innovation leader in the development, production and supply of precision control systems and smart fluid components for agricultural spraying. ARAG operates as a division of our Industrial Precision Solutions segment. In anticipation of the acquisition, the Company entered into a €760,000 senior unsecured term loan facility with a group of banks in August 2023 (the “364-Day Term Loan Facility”). The all-cash ARAG acquisition of approximately €957,000, net of the repayment of approximately €30,300 of debt of the acquired companies, was funded using borrowings under the 364-Day Term Loan Facility and the Company's revolving credit facility.\nCorporate Purpose and Goals\nWe strive to be a vital, self-renewing, worldwide organization that, within the framework of ethical behavior and enlightened citizenship, grows and produces wealth for our customers, employees, shareholders and communities.\nWe operate for the purpose of creating balanced, long-term benefits for all of our constituencies.\nWe focus on long-term growth and returns. Each quarter, we may not produce increased sales, net income, or earnings per share, or exceed the comparative prior year's quarter. When short-term swings occur, we do not intend to alter our foundational objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these temporary occurrences.\nIn 2021, we launched the Ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. Ascend is driven by three interconnected pillars: the NBS (\"Nordson Business System\") Next growth framework; Owner Mindset, our division-led organizational structure; and Winning Teams, our talent strategy. These three pillars are built upon the foundation of what makes Nordson special: our culture and our values.\nThe NBS Next growth framework, the heart of the Ascend strategy, uses data-based segmentation to identify our greatest opportunities for profitable growth and ensure we are investing our resources disproportionately in those areas. Using data in a consistent and disciplined way, leaders across the Company are defining their strategic business priorities.\nWe drive organic growth by continually introducing new products and technology, providing high levels of customer service and support, capturing rapidly expanding opportunities in emerging geographies, and leveraging existing technology into new\nNordson Corporation 4\napplications. Additional growth comes through the acquisition of companies that have differentiated precision technology-based product portfolios, serve attractive high-growth end-markets applications and have a customer-centric business model. The primary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and expand the scope of the solutions we can offer to our customers.\nWe strive to provide genuine customer satisfaction – it is the foundation upon which we continue to build our business.\nComplementing our business strategy is the objective to provide opportunities for employee self-fulfillment, growth, security, recognition and equitable compensation. This goal is met through the Human Resources department’s facilitation of employee training, leadership training and the creation of on-the-job growth opportunities. The result is a highly qualified and professional global team capable of meeting corporate objectives. For more information, see \"Human Capital Resources\" below.\nWe recognize the value of employee participation in the planning process. Strategic and operating plans are developed by all divisions, resulting in a sense of ownership and commitment on the part of employees in accomplishing our objectives.\nWe are an equal opportunity employer.\nAt Nordson, we have a long and proud history of investing in the communities where we live and work.\nWe are committed to contributing approximately five percent of domestic pretax earnings to education, human welfare services and other charitable activities, particularly in communities where we have significant operations. Through the Nordson Corporation Foundation (the “Foundation”), we give back by providing grants to nonprofits in communities where we have facilities employing approximately 100 people. In recent years, we have extended our reach internationally, with giving programs in 11 international locations. In 2022, we also expanded our Matching Gifts program internationally, which further expands our culture of giving around the world. Since 1989, we have donated more than $162 million to communities where we live and work. In addition, our employees volunteered more than 109,000 hours through our Time ‘N Talent and Dollars for Doers programs.\nPrincipal Products and Uses\nWe are a diversified precision technology company that engineers, manufactures and markets differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, medical components, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces. Our precision technology can be found in manufacturing facilities around the world producing a wide range of goods for consumer durable, consumer non-durable, medical and technology end markets. Equipment ranges from single-use components to manual, stand-alone units for low-volume operations to microprocessor-based automated systems for high-speed, high-volume production lines.\nWe market our products globally, primarily through a direct sales force, and also through qualified distributors and sales representatives. We have built a worldwide reputation for creativity and expertise in the design and engineering of high-technology application equipment that meets the specific needs of our customers. We create value for our customers by developing solutions that increase uptime, enable faster line speeds and reduce consumption of materials. We serve a broad customer base, both in terms of industries and geographic regions. In 2023, no single customer accounted for ten percent or more of sales.\nThe following is a summary of the product lines and markets served by our operating segments:\nIndustrial Precision Solutions\nThis segment delivers proprietary dispensing and material processing technology, as well as measurement, inspection and control solutions to diverse end markets.

This segment predominantly serves customers in the electronics end markets.\n•\nElectronics Systems\n–\nAutomated dispensing systems for high-speed, accurate application of a broad range of attachment, protection and coating fluids, and related gas plasma treatment systems for cleaning and conditioning surfaces prior to dispense. Key strategic markets include the breadth of the electronics industry manufacturing supply chain that produces semiconductor, printed circuit board assemblies and electronic components.\n•\nTest and Inspection\n–\nBond testing and automated optical, acoustic microscopy and x-ray inspection systems used in the semiconductor and printed circuit board industries. Key strategic markets include mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, wearable technology, liquid crystal displays, micro hard drives, microprocessors, printed circuit boards, flexible circuits, micro mechanical systems and semiconductor packaging.\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Other Resources\nOur production operations include machining, molding and assembly. We manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment. Many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models. We have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the United States in Ohio, Georgia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota,  Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wisconsin; as well as in the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nPrincipal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics, typically in sheets, bar stock, castings, forgings, tubing and pellets. We also purchase many electrical and electronic components, fabricated metal parts, high-pressure fluid hoses, packings, seals and other items integral to our products. Suppliers are competitively selected based on cost, quality and service. Most significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources. We purchase most raw materials and other\nNordson Corporation 6\ncomponents on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials, particularly imports from China, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods.\nWe monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service, financial stability and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers.\nSenior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment, machinery and systems, and manufacturing processes.\nNatural gas, electricity, and other fuels are our primary energy sources. However, standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed.\nOver the last year, we have seen a stabilization of the global supply chain and improved lead times. We enhanced our risk mitigation and sourcing efforts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Logistics flows have improved, and global forwarding rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to see moderate rate increases on parcel and domestic trucking activity.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and our comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created in the scope of employment, convey all rights to those inventions to us, and restrict the distribution of proprietary information. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\".\nWe protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights to sell our products both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 2,100 granted and pending patents and more than 1,000 trademarks are valuable assets that are important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing, and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual patent or trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single patent, trademark, or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole.\nSeasonal Variation in Business\nHistorically, the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the fiscal year due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs. Accordingly, fiscal first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers’ capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, historic backlog and other unusual events have impacted this historical trend to a degree.\nCompetitive Conditions\nWe operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well-established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding, sealing, finishing, coating, processing, testing, inspecting and fluid control techniques. Potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation, modification or curing of surfaces; dispensing, application, processing or control of fluids and materials; or testing and inspecting for quality.\nMany factors influence our competitive position, including pricing, product quality and service. We maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering high-quality, innovative products and technologies, as well as global service and technical support. Working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position. Our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage.\nCompliance with Governmental Regulations\nOur global operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and compliance obligations relating to the manufacturing, designing and servicing of highly complex products and solutions. Examples of such\nNordson Corporation 7\nregulations, include, but are not limited to, import and export controls, data privacy, environmental, product safety, corruption, bribery, employment and labor. To support our policy of compliance in every jurisdiction we do business, we have robust internal controls, quality management systems, and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also have safeguards established to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments, as well as an ethics helpline reporting system. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business.  For additional information about the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nWe transact with customers and suppliers in numerous geographies around the world and are required to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. import, export and sanctions laws (collectively “Trade Laws”). We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of Trade Laws, and we regularly monitor and adjust our programs and training to reflect changes in Trade Laws or changes in our business. Geopolitical events may result in changes to Trade Laws that may impact our ability to transact business involving certain countries, certain items or certain counterparties, or may impose additional costs or complexity relating to tariffs, taxes, duties or adjustments to our compliance programs, training, or personnel requirements.\nWe are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risks of fines and penalties.  Additionally,  privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"), and the interpretation and enforcement of these and similar laws and regulations, are continuously evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may develop and the costs and complexity of future compliance.\nWe are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, safety and health laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land and water and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Under certain of these laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination. We are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. The operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental, safety and health risks, and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate.\nWe believe that we operate in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses. We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs or legal claims related to environmental regulations, and we accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities. We believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings, liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliance-related costs and expenses may not arise in the future. For example, future adoption of new or amended environmental laws, regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect, but cannot be presently anticipated.\nWe believe that policies, practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material regulation or compliance obligations arising from our operations. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign regulation and laws during 2023 had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for any such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or liquidity, but we cannot guarantee that material liabilities may not arise from regulation and compliance obligations in the future.\nHuman Capital Resources\nEmployee Profile\nAs of October 31, 2023, we had approximately 7,900 full-time and part-time employees, including 115 at our Amherst, Ohio, facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on November 16, 2025.\nTotal Rewards\nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and\nNordson Corporation 8\nincentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population.\nIn the U.S., we match contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (the “Savings Plan”) for all eligible employees, in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach 6% of her or his base compensation. In addition, non-union new hires and re-hires as of July 1, 2021 are eligible for an additional enhanced 401(k) contribution of 3% eligible earnings. All contributions by employees into the Savings Plan are fully vested immediately. Company contributions, both the match and enhanced contribution, have a three-year graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 1/3% each year until fully vested after three years of employment. We also maintain a non-qualified, unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management employees whose benefits under the Savings Plan are limited by the benefit restrictions of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, non-union employees hired prior to July 1, 2021 are eligible to participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the “Salaried Pension Plan”). The Salaried Pension Plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with up to 30 years of service retirement income replacement that is approximately 55% of eligible compensation, subject to the Internal Revenue Code maximum monthly benefit. Participants fully vest in the Salaried Pension Plan after five years of service. All eligible union employees hired prior to November 1, 2004 participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the “Hourly Pension Plan”). The Hourly Pension Plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees’ retirement income. We also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan (“Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan”), which is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to U.S.-based eligible participants hired prior to July 1, 2021, as a replacement for retirement benefits limited by regulations under the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn 2022, we launched a global recognition program that allows managers and peers to recognize the special achievements of others through both written recognition shared on a company awards feed, as well as monetary recognition that allows a recipient to choose a physical gift, gift card or donate the value of their recognition to charity. We also continue our service award program, which demonstrates appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with five or more years of service. Service milestones are recognized at each five-year increment by presentation of a digital and/or printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog.\nTalent\nOur key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products and customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. Attracting and retaining the best talent relies on our ability to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, personal and professional growth opportunities, and a rewarding employee experience. We strive to uphold a culture of shared knowledge, appreciation and success. We believe that our average tenure across the globe reflects our positive workplace culture and the strong engagement of our employees. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions.\nTalent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Development plans are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along the established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities.\nOne of our core values—Respect for People—reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business. Our approach encompasses inclusion awareness and skill-building, intentionality with respect to diversity in our hiring and selection process and performance management and succession planning that recognizes the importance of diversity.  Nordson’s employee resource groups strengthen our commitment to fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace where everyone feels like they belong. Participation in these groups is open to all employees. We regularly reflect on our progress and explore opportunities to improve our inclusion and diversity programs, including at the executive leadership and Board levels.\nAvailable Information\nOur annual report (\"Form 10-K\"), quarterly reports (\"Form 10-Q\") and current reports (Form \"8-K\") and amendments to those reports filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge at https://investors.nordson.com as soon as reasonably practical after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

    "text": "In an enterprise as diverse as ours, a wide range of factors could affect future performance. We discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, value and results of operations. You should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk factor has not already materialized. Additional risks factors may exist that are not presently known by the Company or that are currently deemed immaterial may also be present.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nChanges in United States or international economic conditions, including declines in the industries we serve, could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations.\nIn 2023, approximately 34 percent of our revenue was generated in the United States, while approximately 66 percent was generated outside the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world and the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have to date negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nA general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition or liquidity. Our largest markets include consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive. A slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability.\nA portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets, such as the electronics, polymer processing and metal finishing industries, which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions. The demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers. Downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products. It is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future.\nAny significant downturn in the health of the general economy, or any recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event, including inflationary pressures, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance, resulting in impairment of assets. We cannot predict the strength or duration of any economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery.\nOur results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in U.S. trade policy, including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments.\nOur ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including the impact of the “United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement” with Mexico and Canada, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. Other effects of these changes, including impacts on the price of raw materials, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate, could also have significant impacts on our results. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, the\nconflicts\nin Europe and the Middle East\nmay have significant adverse effects on international trade policy.\nSignificant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the Chinese yuan. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the United States dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\nA significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2023 were generated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which is our reporting currency. We recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between the United States dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and may continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation movements, which historically have been material and could continue to be material. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility\nNordson Corporation 10\nof currency exchange rates. We take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure, such as entering into hedging transactions, where applicable, but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. For example, the impact of conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, changes in monetary policies and the effects of the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (\"Brexit\") have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Future adverse consequences arising from the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and Brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates. Any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into United States dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations diminish the United States dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and, if they occur or continue for significant periods, could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nPolitical conditions in and between the United States and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us.\nWe conduct our manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the United States. We expect that international operations and United States export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Both sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nrisks of political or economic instability;\n•\nunanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n•\nthreats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, including conflicts in Europe and the Middle East;\n•\nchanges in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws that impact how United States multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings;\n•\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;\n•\npotential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n•\nthe disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n•\nthe imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the U.S. presidential administration; and\n•\nexchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country.\nAny of these events could reduce the demand for our products, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nOur international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. The current U.S. presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements, and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements, or restrictions on trade generally, more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future.\nFailure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel, including factory production workers and other staff, to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace those who retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and workforce and to attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global\nNordson Corporation 11\ngrowth and operational initiatives, possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which would likely harm our revenues, operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability.\nThe Company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes.\nWe regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. We also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. The Company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.\nIncreased information technology threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybercrime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber-attacks to our systems and networks. To date, we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyber-attacks. To conduct our business, we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. Increased global information technology security threats, more sophisticated and targeted computer crime and cyberterrorism pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. A cyber-attack or other disruption may also result in financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyber-attack. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events.\nWe have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. It is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack, unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner.\nThe interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the European Union’s GDPR and the CCPA), are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nA disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, including as a result of inflation. The conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the availability and prices for raw materials, parts, and components. While we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material, part and component costs to our customers in the form of price increases, there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors.\nShortages in raw materials or our inability to pass along\nNordson Corporation 12\nprice increases could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, demand surges, damaging weather or other acts of nature (including weather or other acts of nature caused by climate change), pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, impact our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost or decreased sales, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary. The steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. The agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and existing trade secrets, patent and copyright law afford us limited protection. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. Further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business.\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined our products infringe. We may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property. We might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nRisks Related to the Execution of Our Strategy\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nInnovation is critical to our success. We believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions. We also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our\nNordson Corporation 13\ncompetitive position. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nOur recent historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. For example, in August 2023, we completed our acquisition of the ARAG Group. We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, including the recent acquisitions of the ARAG Group and CyberOptics Corporation (\"CyberOptics\"), once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow.\nThe success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:\n•\nour ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition, and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;\n•\ndiversion of management’s time and attention from other business concerns;\n•\ndifficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business;\n•\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies;\n•\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;\n•\nthe risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets; and\n•\nthe ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing.\nIn addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of incurring acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition potential tax liabilities, acquisition expenses, the amortization of acquisition-acquired assets, or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition.\nWe may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. We could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws.\nAny impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist, if our stock price and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material.\nNordson Corporation 14\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in United States and international tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our business, financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The U.S. federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. While we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the SEC. Our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws, and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe level of returns on pension plan assets, changes in the actuarial assumptions used and management of pension liabilities could adversely affect us.\nOur operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. Our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. Changes in assumptions, laws or regulations and how the Company manages pension liabilities could lead to variability in financial results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity.\nOur global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements, and compliance with evolving environmental regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nWe are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nChanges in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nIt is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations within and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,\nNordson Corporation 15\nfines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our ESG Report. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control.\nIn addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where environmental, social and governance focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur inability to comply with the restrictive covenants included in the agreements governing our debt or to access additional sources of capital could impede our growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing debt.\nThe limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities.\nThe agreements governing our existing debt contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n•\nborrow money or guarantee the debts of others;\n•\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n•\nmake restricted payments or distributions; and\n•\nsell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies.\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios, including a “Leverage Ratio” and an “Interest Coverage Ratio,” both as defined in the credit facilities.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the agreement governing our debt will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. We may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities, including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates.\nWe may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing debt. If we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing debt. Our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt. In addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. Finally, as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions, our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized.\nNordson Corporation 16\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect us.\nAny period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability. As of October 31, 2023, we had $\n1,749,305\nof total debt outstanding, of whic\nh $553,020 was p\nriced at interest rates that float with the market. A one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2023 would have resulted in approximately $5,530\nof additional interest expense. A higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. For additional detail related to this\nrisk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail or deny our claims. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nOur business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control.\nWhile we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities, severe weather conditions, including any that may be caused by global climate change, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, as well as major earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of inventory, disruption in the transport of products and utilities, and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. Any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations."

We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management.\nCertain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. On a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board of directors.\nRevenue recognition -\nA contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company's revenue recognition policy.\nBusiness combinations -\nThe acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. The fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, and other relevant information. Such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts, which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values. The valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and asset lives, among other items. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense.\nGoodwill -\nGoodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more often if indications of impairment exist.\nWe test goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2023. We use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values. To test for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the Income Approach and the Market Approach.\nThe discounted cash flow method (\"Income Approach\") uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. Terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the Gordon Growth Model Method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") methodology and growth rate. For each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. Discount rates are developed using a WACC methodology.\nThe WACC represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors. For 2023, the WACC rates used ranged from 8.3 percent to 11.0 percent depending upon the reporting unit's size, end market volatility and projection risk. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the valuation methodologies used.\nNordson Corporation 24\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment.\nThe fair value (\"FV\") was compared to the carrying value (\"CV\") for each reporting unit. Based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of August 1, 2023, our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2023. Potential events or circumstances, such as a sustained downturn in global economies, could have a negative effect on estimated fair values.\nPension plan in the United States\n- The measurement of the liabilities related to our domestic pension plan is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors, including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and turnover assumptions, and health care cost trend rates. The liabilities associated with the Company's international pension plans and OPEB are not as materially sensitive to changes in assumptions as the pension plan in the United States.\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 6.08 percent at October 31, 2023 and 5.70 percent at October 31, 2022. The discount rate used was determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled.\nIn determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions. The expected rate of return (long-term investment rate) on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 6.40 percent and 5.75 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 3.92 percent and 4.30 percent at  October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively.\nAnnual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year. Differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years.\nEconomic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. The effect of a one percent change in the discount rate, expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below. Bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts.\nIncome taxes\n– Income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances. We provide valuation allowances\nNordson Corporation 25\nagainst deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nManagement believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income, allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount (including the valuation allowance), an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made.\nFurther, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. Significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. Additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. As a result, our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. Any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known.\nARAG Group Acquisition\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the ARAG Group pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2023, by and among the Company and the Sellers. ARAG is a global market and innovation leader in the development, production and supply of precision control systems and smart fluid components for agricultural spraying. ARAG operates as a division of our Industrial Precision Solutions segment. In anticipation of the acquisition, the Company entered into a €760,000 senior unsecured term loan facility with a group of banks in August 2023 (the “364-Day Term Loan Facility”). The all-cash ARAG acquisition of approximately €957,000, net of the repayment of approximately €30,300 of debt of the acquired companies, was funded using borrowings under the 364-Day Term Loan Facility and the Company's revolving credit facility. The 364-Day Term Loan Facility was subsequentially paid off in September 2023 with the net proceeds of a senior notes offering (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details).\nBased on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $694,900 and identifiable intangible assets of $353,500 were recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $27,500 of tradenames (amortized over nine years), $31,000 of technology (amortized over five years), and $295,000 of customer relationships (amortized over twenty-two years).\nThe financial results of the ARAG Group acquisition are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a detailed discussion comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. For a discussion of other changes from the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.\nAs used throughout this annual report, geographic regions include the Americas (United States, Canada, Mexico and Central and South America), Asia Pacific and Europe.\n2023 compared to 2022\nWorldwide sales for 2023 were $2,628,632, an increase of 1.5 percent from 2022 sales of $2,590,278. The increase consisted of a 3.8 percent increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1.4 percent decline in organic sales and unfavorable currency translation effects that decreased sales by 0.9 percent.\nSales outside the United States accounted for 66.2 percent of total sales in 2023, as compared to 66.8 percent in 2022. On a geographic basis, sales in the Americas region were $1,149,760, an increase of 4.8 percent from 2022, with organic sales increasing 2.0 percent, a 2.4 percent increase from acquisitions, and favorable currency effects of 0.4 percent. Sales in the Asia Pacific region were $796,196, a decrease of 6.1 percent from 2022, with organic sales decreasing 8.2 percent and unfavorable currency effects of 3.1 percent, partially offset by a 5.2 percent increase from acquisitions. Sales in Europe were $682,676, an increase of 5.7 percent from 2022, with organic sales increasing 1.4 percent, a 4.2 percent increase from acquisitions, and favorable currency effects of 0.1 percent.\nCost of sales were $1,203,227 in 2023, up\n3.4 percent from $1,163,742 in 2022. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased to 54.2 percent in 2023 from 55.1 percent in 2022. The 0.9 percentage point decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by incremental inventory step-up amortization related to acquisitions in 2023 of $8,862 and unfavorable foreign currency effects.\nNordson Corporation 26\nSelling and administrative expenses were $752,644 in 2023, up from $724,176 in 2022. The 3.9 percent increase was driven by a 8.3 percent increase due to the first-year effect of an acquisition, including acquisition costs, partially offset by lower base business costs and favorable currency translation effects which decreased costs by 5.3 percent. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 28.6 percent in 2023 from 28.0 percent in 2022. The 0.6 percentage point increase was primarily due to cost structure simplification actions taken in 2023.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.6 percent in 2023 compared to 27.1 percent in 2022. The 1.5 percent decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by inventory step-up amortization and other costs related to the first-year effect of acquisitions.\nInterest expense in 2023 was $59,505, an increase of $37,092, or 165.5 percent, from\n2022\n. The increase was due to higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates compared to the prior year primarily driven by acquisitions. During 2022, the Company recognized non-cash pension settlement charges of $41,221 related to the purchase of an annuity contract to relieve the Company of certain U.S. pension benefit obligations. Other expense in 2023 was $597 compared to other income of $8,527 in\n2022\n. Included in other expense in 2023 w\nere $7,742 in net foreign currency losses, which were largely offset by pension gains. Included in the prior year’s other income were $6,270 in foreign currency gains.\nIncome tax expense in 2023 was $127,846, or 20.8 percent of pre-tax income, as compared to $136,176, or 21.0 percent of pre-tax income in\n2022\n. The income tax provision for 2023 included a tax benefit of $4,286 due to our share-based payment transactions. Our income tax provision for 2022 included a tax benefit of $3,273 due to our share-based payment transactions.\nNet income was $487,493, or $8.46 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to net income of $513,103, or $8.81 per diluted share, in 2022. This represented a 5.0 percent decrease in net income and a 4.1 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share. The decrease of $0.35 per diluted share was primarily driven by higher interest expense and acquisition-related expenses in 2023 compared to non-cash pension settlement charges in 2022.\nIndustrial Precision Solutions\nSales of the Industrial Precision Solutions segment were $1,391,046 in 2023, an increase of 4.0 percent, from 2022 sales of $1,337,242. The increase was the result of an organic sales increase of 3.1 percent and an increase of 1.9 percent from acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 1.0 percent. Organic sales growth was generally strong across most product lines and regions.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 33.1 percent in 2023 compared to 32.5 percent in 2022. The\n0.6 percentage point improvement\nin operating margin was primarily the result of improved selling and administrative expense leverage due to increased sales volumes.\nMedical and Fluid Solutions\nSales of the Medical and Fluid Solutions segment were $660,316 in 2023, a decrease of 4.3 percent from 2022 sales of $690,177. The decrease was the result of an organic sales decrease of 3.7 percent and unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 0.6 percent. The organic sales decrease was driven by lower demand for the medical fluid components and fluid solutions product lines, materially offset by continued strength in medical interventional solutions product lines.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 28.7 percent in 2023 compared to 31.5 percent in 2022. The 2.8 percent percentage point decline in operating margin was principally driven by meaningful sales mix changes within medical product lines and related factory inefficiencies due to reduced volumes.\nAdvanced Technology Solutions\nSales of the Advanced Technology Solutions segment were $577,270 in 2023, an increase of 2.6 percent from 2022 sales of $562,859. The increase consisted of a volume increase of 3.7 percent, inclusive of an organic sales decrease of 9.2 percent and a 12.9 percent increase from acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 1.1 percent. The organic sales decrease was driven by lower demand in electronics dispense product lines, partially offset by stronger demand in test and inspection product lines.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 17.6 percent in 2023 compared to 23.7 percent in 2022. The 6.1 percentage point decline in operating margin was primarily due to fees, severance, and non-cash inventory charges of $10,295 associated with the CyberOptics acquisition and factory inefficiencies due to reduced volumes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $47,778 in 2023 to $115,679 as of October 31, 2023 compared to $163,457 as of October 31, 2022. Approximately 81 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries as of October 31, 2023.\nNordson Corporation 27\nCash provided by operating activities was $641,282 in 2023, compared to $513,131 in 2022. The primary sources were net income adjusted for non-cash income and expenses (consisting of depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation, provision for losses on receivables, deferred income taxes, other non-cash expense, gain/loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, and non-cash pension settlement charges), which were $615,496 in 2023, compared to $676,200 in 2022. Changes in working capital items used cash of $3,571 compared to $107,314 used in 2022 principally driven by decreases in receivables and inventory while cash provided by other operating items was $29,357 in 2023 compared to cash used of $55,755 in 2022.\nCash used in investing activities was $1,436,879 in 2023, compared to $222,761 in 2022. In 2023, $1,422,780 in cash was used for acquisitions, utilizing borrowings and cash from operations, compared to $171,613 used in 2022. Capital expenditures were $34,583 in 2023 compared to $51,428 in 2022.\nCash provided by financing activities was $750,512 in 2023, compared to $416,006 cash used in 2022. Proceeds and repayments of long-term debt provided $976,043 of cash in 2023, compared to $33,908 used in 2022. In 2023, cash of $89,708 was used for the purchase of treasury shares, down from $262,869 used in 2022. Dividend payments were $150,356 in 2023, up from $125,914 in 2022 due to an increase in dividends on our common shares, on an annual basis, to $2.63 per share from $2.18 per share. Issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated $21,373 of cash in 2023, up from $12,124 in 2022.\nThe following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from October 31, 2022 to October 31, 2023. Receivables-net and inventories-net combined increased $124,950, goodwill increased $979,508\n, and i\nntangible assets-net increased $343,342 principally due to\nthe acquisitions of\nthe ARAG Group and\nCy\nberOptics. Long-term debt, including current maturities, increased $999,199, principally due to the acquisition of the ARAG Group.\nWe have a $1,150,000 unsecured multi-currency credit facility with a group of banks which provides for a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000, maturing in June 2026, and a multicurrency revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850,000, maturing in June 2028. In anticipation of the ARAG acquisition, the Company entered into the 364-Day Term Loan Facility in August 2023. On September 13, 2023, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $350,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 5.600% Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and $500,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 5.800% Notes due 2033 (together with the 2028 Notes, the “Notes\"). The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay its borrowings under the 364-Day Term Loan Facility. At October 31, 2023, we had $300,000 outstanding on the term loan facility and $248,000 outstanding on the revolving credit facility compared to no outstanding balance at October 31, 2022 under the old revolving credit facility.\nOur operating performance, balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2023 remained strong. Total debt increased $999,199 during 2023 primarily d\nue to the acquisition of\nthe ARAG Group. The Company is well-positioned to manage liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations, as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. Primary sources of capital to meet these needs, as well as other opportunistic investments, are a combination of cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Cash from operations, which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets, is expected to be more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The Company believes it has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its long-term needs for cash.\nContractual and Other Material Cash Obligations\nThe following table summarizes contractual and other material cash obligations as of October 31, 2023:\n(1)\nRefer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nNordson Corporation 28\n(3)\nPension and postretirement plan funding amounts will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n(4)\nPurchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe believe that the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources such as our credit facilities, including our revolving credit facility, are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. There are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company.\nNew Accounting Standards\nThere have been no new accounting standards issued which would require either disclosure or adoption during the current period by the Company.\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nThe impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate. As a general rule, a weakening of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income, while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect.\nIn 2023, as compared with 2022, the United States dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. If 2022 exchange rates had been in effect during 2023, sales would have been approximately $23,153 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately $15,210 higher. In 2022, as compared with 2021, the United States dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. If 2021 exchange rates had been in effect during 2022, sales would have been approximately $103,829 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately $68,788 higher. These effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates.\nTrends\nOur solid historical performance is attributed to our diverse geographic and end market participation and our long-term commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs.\nSafe Harbor Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis annual report, particularly “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

    "text": "We operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts, primarily associated with the euro, yen and pound sterling, typically have maturities of 90 days or less, and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for United States dollars at rates stated in the contracts. Gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains, respectively, on the underlying transactions. We use foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to help mitigate the risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\nRefer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions.\nA portion of our operations is financed with short-term and long-term borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates.\nThe tables that follow present principal repayments and weighted-average interest rates on outstanding borrowings of fixed-rate debt.\nWe also have variable-rate long-term debt.

Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to “we” or the “Company” mean Nordson Corporation.\nUnless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year.\nNote 1 —\nSignificant accounting policies\nConsolidation\n— The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nordson Corporation and its 100%-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates and joint ventures in which our ownership is\n50\npercent or less or in which we do not have control but have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates\n— The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.\nFiscal year\n— Our fiscal year is November 1 through October 31.\nRevenue recognition\n— A contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and primarily is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. Revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenues deferred as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nHowever, for certain contracts related to the sale of customer-specific products within our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment, revenue is recognized for these contracts over time as we satisfy performance obligations because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The continuous transfer of control to the customer occurs as we enhance assets that are customer controlled, and we are contractually entitled to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable margin.\nAs control transfers over time for these products or services, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligations. The selection method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We have elected to use the input method – costs incurred for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of products or services to the customer based on incurring costs on the contract. Under this method, revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Contract assets recognized are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and contract liabilities are recorded in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not material at October 31, 2023 or 2022. Revenue recognized over time represented approximately less than\nten\npercent of our overall consolidated revenues at October 31, 2023 or 2022.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services. Taxes, including sales and value add, that we collect concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. As a practical expedient, we may exclude the assessment of whether goods or services are performance obligations, if they are immaterial in the context of the contract, and combine these with other performance obligations. While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to treat all shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs, as a significant portion of these costs are incurred prior to transfer of control to the customer. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as they are incurred, as the amortization period resulting from capitalizing the costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe offer assurance-type warranties on our products as well as separately sold warranty contracts. Revenue related to warranty contracts that are sold separately is recognized over the life of the warranty term and is not material. Certain arrangements may include installation, installation supervision, training and spare parts, which tend to be completed in a short period of time, at an insignificant cost, and utilizing skills not unique to us; therefore, these items are typically regarded as inconsequential or not material.\nWe disclose disaggregated revenues by operating segment and geography in accordance with the revenue standard and on the same basis used internally by the chief operating decision maker for evaluating performance of operating segments and for allocating resources. Refer to Note 15 for details on our operating segments.\nNordson Corporation 36\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nShipping and handling costs\n— Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue. Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of sales.\nAdvertising costs\n— Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $\n7,635\n, $\n7,028\nand $\n5,986\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nResearch and development\n— Investments in research and development are important to our long-term growth, enabling us to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs through the development of new products and new applications for existing products. We place strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through internal engineering and research teams. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and were $\n71,400\n, $\n52,531\nand $\n59,422\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEarnings per share\n— Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each year, while diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding. Common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon exercise of stock options computed using the treasury stock method, as well as restricted stock and deferred stock-based compensation. Options whose exercise price is higher than the average market price are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options for\n140\ncommon shares were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation in 2023 and\n78\nand\n46\noptions were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Under the 2021 Stock Incentive and Award Plan, executive officers and selected other key employees receive common share awards based on corporate performance measures over\nthree-year\nperformance periods. Awards for which performance measures have not been met were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\nCash and cash equivalents\n— Highly liquid instruments with maturities of\n90\ndays or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\n— An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. The amount of the allowance is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience and known factors regarding specific customers. Accounts are written off against the allowance when it becomes evident that collection will not occur. Credit is extended to customers satisfying pre-defined credit criteria. We believe we have limited concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of our customer base.\nOur primary allowance for credit losses is the allowance for doubtful accounts, which is principally determined based on aging of receivables. Receivables are exposed to credit risk based on the customers' ability to pay which is influenced by, among other factors, their financial liquidity. We perform ongoing customer credit evaluation to maintain sufficient allowances for potential credit losses. Our segments perform credit evaluation and monitoring to estimate and manage credit risk through the review of customer information, credit ratings, approval and monitoring of customer credit limits, and assessment of market conditions. We may also require prepayments or bank guarantees from customers to mitigate credit risk. Our receivables are generally short-term in nature with a majority of receivables outstanding less than 90 days. Accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if deemed uncollectible.\nAccounts receivable are net of an allowance for credit losses of $\n10,015\nand $\n8,218\nat October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. The provision for losses on receivables was $\n283\nfor the twelve months ended October 31, 2023 compared to $\n1,259\nfor the same period a year ago. The remaining change in the allowance for credit losses is principally related to increases due to acquisitions and the write-off of uncollectible accounts.\nInventories\n— Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Effective in the third quarter of 2022, we changed our accounting method for certain U.S. inventories from a last-in, first-out basis (\"LIFO\") to a first-in, first-out basis (\"FIFO\"). Previously, the LIFO method was used to determine the cost of a portion of our inventories in the U.S. We believe this change in accounting method is preferable as it is consistent with how we manage our business, results in a uniform method to value our inventory across all regions of our business, improves comparability with our peers and is expected to better reflect the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets. We applied this accounting change as a cumulative effect adjustment to cost of sales in the third quarter of 2022 and did not restate prior period financial statements because the impact was not material.\nDerivatives\n— The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative instruments are used to manage risks associated with foreign exchange rates.\nWe operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currency transactions occur and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts usually have maturities of\nNordson Corporation 37\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\n90\ndays or less and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars at maturity, at rates stated in the contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in each accounting period in “Other – net” on the Consolidated Statements of Income together with the transaction gain or loss from the related balance sheet position. The settlement of these contracts is recorded in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries. These hedges are included on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether a hedge has been designated. For derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are used to hedge net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries, we designate the hedging instrument as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation with the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The settlement of these hedges is recorded in investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in current net earnings in \"Other-net\" on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nProperty, plant and equipment and depreciation\n— Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Plant and equipment are depreciated for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the case of property under finance leases, over the terms of the leases. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives.\nUseful lives are as follows:\nDepreciation expense is included in Cost of sales and Selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on whether they are incurred in the preliminary project stage, application development stage or the post-implementation stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software beginning with the project’s completion. All re-engineering costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on significant capital projects are capitalized.\nNo\ninterest was capitalized in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\n— Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to specific reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment testing is performed as of August 1. Testing is done more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of those assets.\nThe acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. The fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, and other relevant information. Such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts, which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values. The valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and asset lives, among other items. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense.\nOther amortizable intangible assets, which consist primarily of patent/technology costs, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names, are amortized over their useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nNordson Corporation 38\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nAt October 31, 2023, the weighted-average useful lives for each major category of amortizable intangible assets were:\nForeign currency translation\n— The financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of exchange. The resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of Shareholders’ equity. Generally, gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, including forward contracts, of these subsidiaries and the United States parent are included in net income. Gains and losses from intercompany foreign currency transactions of a long-term investment nature are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n—\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss at October 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of:\nWarranties\n— We offer warranties to our customers depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. A typical warranty program requires that we repair or replace defective products within a specified time period (generally\none year\n) measured from the date of delivery or first use. We record an estimate for future warranty-related costs based on actual historical return rates. Based on analysis of return rates and other factors, the adequacy of our warranty provisions is adjusted as necessary. The liability for warranty costs is included in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of the product warranty liability as of  October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nNote 2 —\nRecently issued accounting standards\nThere have been no new material accounting standards issued which would require either disclosure or adoption during the current period.\nNote 3 — Acquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method, with the acquired assets and liabilities recorded at estimated fair value on the dates of acquisition. The cost in excess of the net assets of the business acquired is included in goodwill. Operating results since the respective dates of acquisitions are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNordson Corporation 39\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\n2023 Acquisitions\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the ARAG Group and its subsidiaries (\"ARAG Group\" or \"ARAG\") pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 25, 2023, by and among the Company, its Italian subsidiary, Capvis Equity V LP, DRIP Co-Investment, and certain individuals. ARAG is a global market and innovation leader in the development, production and supply of precision control systems and smart fluid components for agricultural spraying. ARAG operates as a division of our Industrial Precision Solutions segment. In anticipation of the acquisition, the Company entered into a €\n760,000\nsenior unsecured term loan facility with a group of banks in August 2023 (the “364-Day Term Loan Facility”). The all-cash ARAG acquisition of approximately €\n957,000\n, net of the repayment of approximately €\n30,300\nof debt of the acquired companies, was funded using borrowings under the 364-Day Term Loan Facility and the Company's revolving credit facility. The 364-Day Term Loan Facility was subsequentially paid off in September 2023 with the net proceeds of a senior notes offering (see Note 9 for additional details). Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $\n694,900\nand identifiable intangible assets of $\n353,500\nwere recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $\n27,500\nof tradenames (amortized over\nnine years\n), $\n31,000\nof technology (amortized over\nfive years\n), and $\n295,000\nof customer relationships (amortized over\ntwenty-two years\n). Goodwill associated with the acquisition was not tax deductible. As of October 31, 2023, the purchase price allocation remains preliminary as we complete our assessment principally of income taxes. The financial results of the ARAG Group acquisition are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe assets and liabilities acquired were as follows:\nOn November 3, 2022, we acquired\n100\n% of CyberOptics Corporation (\"CyberOptics\"). CyberOptics is a leading global developer and manufacturer of high-precision 3D optical s\nensing technology solutions. The CyberOptics acquisition expanded our test and inspection platform, providing differentiated technology that expands our product offering in the semiconductor and electronics industries and is reported in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment. We acquired CyberOptics for an aggregate purchase price of $\n377,843\n, net of cash of approximately $\n40,890\n, funded using borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $\n285,330\nand identifiable intangible assets of $\n58,600\nwere recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $\n15,200\nof tradenames (amortized over\n15\nyears), $\n14,600\nof technology (amortized over\n7\nyears), and $\n28,800\nof customer relationships (amortized over\n12\nyears). Goodwill associated with the acquisition was not tax deductible\n. As of October 31, 2023, the purchase price allocation is final. The results of CyberOptics are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNordson Corporation 40\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe assets and liabilities acquired were as follows:\n2022 acquisition\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired\n100\npercent of NDC Technologies (\"NDC\"), a leading global provider of precision measurement solutions for in-line manufacturing process control. NDC's technology portfolio includes in-line measurement sensors, gauges and analyzers using near-infrared, laser, X-ray, optical and nucleonic technologies, as well as proprietary algorithms and software. We acquired NDC for an aggregate purchase price of $\n171,613\n, net of cash of approximately $\n7,533\nand other working capital adjustments of $\n2,763\n, utilizing cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $\n131,129\nand identifiable intangible assets of $\n31,130\nwere recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $\n10,800\nof tradenames (amortized over\n13\nyears), $\n10,000\nof technology (amortized over\n7\nyears), $\n9,500\nof customer relationships (amortized over\n4\nyears) and $\n830\nof non-compete agreements (amortized over\n3\nyears). Goodwill associated with this acquisition of $\n72,018\nis tax deductible. This acquisition is being reported in our Industrial Precision Solutions segment and the results of NDC are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNordson Corporation 41\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNordson Corporation 42\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 5 —\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350 and account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the entities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment testing is performed as of August 1. Testing is done more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of those assets. We assess the fair value of reporting units on a non-recurring basis using a quantitative analysis that uses a combination of the discounted cash flow method of the Income Approach and the guideline public company method of the Market Approach, and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets. The implied fair value of our reporting units is determined based on significant unobservable inputs, as discussed below; accordingly, these inputs fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The discounted cash flow method (\"Income Approach\") uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. Terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the Gordon Growth Model Method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") methodology and growth rate. For each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. Discount rates are developed using a WACC methodology. The WACC represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors.\nIn the application of the guideline public company method (\"Market Approach\"), fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity. The comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available. An indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group. Valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve-month performance for revenues and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") into total invested capital, which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash. These multiples are applied against the revenue and EBITDA of each reporting unit. While the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results, the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future. Accordingly, the reasonable, implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the consideration of both the Income and Market approaches.\nAn impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in the quantitative analysis described above. Based on our annual impairment tests in 2023, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and accordingly, we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nOur reporting units include components of the Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and the Advanced Technology Solutions segments.\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill during 2023 by operating segment:\nThe increase in goodwill for 2023 was due to the acquisition of CyberOptics and the ARAG Group. See Note 3 for additional details.\nNordson Corporation 43\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill during 2022 by operating segment:\nThe increase in goodwill for 2022 was due to the acquisition of NDC. See Note 3 for additional details.\nInformation regarding intangible assets subject to amortization:\nAmortization expense for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n59,719\n, $\n50,825\nand $\n50,551\n, respectively. See Note 3 for details regarding intangibles recorded due to the acquisition of CyberOptics and the ARAG Group.\nEstimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years:\nNote 6 —\nRetirement, pension and other postretirement plans\nRetirement plans\n— We have funded contributory retirement plans covering certain employees. Our contributions are primarily determined by the terms of the plans, subject to the limitation that they shall not exceed the amounts deductible for income tax purposes. We also sponsor unfunded contributory supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. Generally, benefits under these plans vest gradually over a period of approximately\nthree years\nfrom date of employment, and are based on the employee’s contribution. The expense applicable to retirement plans for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $\n29,511\n, $\n26,635\nand $\n22,983\n, respectively.\nPension plans\n— We have various pension plans covering a portion of our United States and international employees. Pension plan benefits are generally based on years of employment and, for salaried employees, the level of compensation. Actuarially\nNordson Corporation 44\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\ndetermined amounts are contributed to United States plans to provide sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment requirements. We also sponsor an unfunded supplemental pension plan for certain employees. International subsidiaries fund their pension plans according to local requirements.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we completed a partial plan settlement transaction in regards to\ntwo\nof our U.S. pension plans in which plan assets amounting to $\n171,181\nwere used to purchase a group annuity contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America (\"Prudential\"). The settlement resulted in a loss of $\n41,221\n, which is included in Pension settlement charge for U.S. Plans on the Consolidated Statements of Income. This transaction relieved the Company of its responsibility for the pension obligation related to certain retired employees and transferred the obligation and payment responsibility to Prudential for retirement benefits owed to approximately\n1,500\nretirees and other beneficiaries. The annuity contract covered retirees who commenced receiving benefits on or before November 1, 2021. The monthly retirement benefit payment amounts currently received by retirees and their beneficiaries did not change as a result of this transaction. Plan participants not included in the transaction remain in the plans and responsibility for payment of the retirement benefits remains with the Company.\nA reconciliation of the benefit obligations, plan assets, accrued benefit cost and the amount recognized in financial statements for pension plans is as follows:\nThe net actuarial gain included in the projected benefit obligation for the United States pension plans for 2023 was primarily due to higher discount rates partially offset by losses due to demographic experience. The net actuarial gain included in the projected benefit obligation for the United States pension plans for 2022 was primarily due to higher discount rates partially offset by an increase in the compensation increase assumption.\nNordson Corporation 45\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss (income):\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss (income):\nInformation regarding the funded status of the Company's plans is as follows:\nNet periodic pension costs include the following components:\nNet periodic pension\ncost for 2023 included a settlement gain of $\n335\ndue to lump sum retirement payments. Net periodic pension cost for 2022 and 2021 included settlement losses of $\n298\nand $\n4,143\n, respectively, due to lump sum retirement payments. Net periodic pension cost for 2022 included a curtailment gain of $\n2,112\ndue to the freeze of an international defined benefit plan.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost other than service cost are included in Pension settlement charge for U.S. Plans and Other – net in our\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n.\nNordson Corporation 46\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits were as follows:\nThe amortization of prior service cost is determined using a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate used considers a yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available bonds that receive the highest rating given from a recognized investments ratings agency. The changes in the discount rates in 2023, 2022 and 2021 are due to changes in yields for these types of investments as a result of the economic environment.\nIn determining the expected return on plan assets using the calculated value of plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return assumptions. The rate of compensation increase is based on management’s estimates using historical experience and expected increases in rates.\nThe international plans include a cash balance plan with promised interest crediting rates. The weighted average crediting rates were\n0.70\n%,\n0.60\n% and\n0.50\n% for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNet actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when exceeding the accounting corridor, which is set at 10 percent of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations.\nGains or losses within the corridor remain in other comprehensive income and are retested in subsequent measurements. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan. If substantially all of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used.\nThe allocation of pension plan assets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nOur investment objective for defined benefit plan assets is to meet the plans’ benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future required plan contributions.\nNordson Corporation 47\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nOur United States plans comprise\n89\npercent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. In general, the investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments, and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by dynamically matching the actuarial projections of the plans’ future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. For 2023, the target in “return-seeking assets” is\n30\npercent and\n70\npercent in longer duration fixed income assets. Plan assets are diversified across multiple investment managers and are invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment managers’ performance relative to the guidelines established with each investment manager.\nOur international plans comprise\n11\npercent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. Asset allocations are developed on a country-specific basis. Our investment strategy is to cover pension obligations with insurance contracts or to employ independent managers to invest the assets.\nThe fair values of our pension plan assets at October 31, 2023 by asset category are in the table below:\nNordson Corporation 48\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe fair values of our pension plan assets at October 31, 2022 by asset category are in the table below:\nThese investment funds did not own a significant number of Nordson Corporation common shares for any year presented.\nThe inputs and methodology used to measure fair value of plan assets are consistent with those described in Note 11. Following are the valuation methodologies used to measure these assets:\n•\nMoney market funds\n- Money market funds are public investment vehicles that are valued with a net asset value of one dollar. This value is a quoted price in an active market and is classified as Level 1.\n•\nEquity securities\n- Common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1.\n•\nFixed income securities\n- U.S. Treasury bills reflect the closing price on the active market in which the securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. Securities of U.S. agencies are valued using bid evaluations and are classified as Level 2. Corporate fixed income securities are valued using evaluated prices, such as dealer quotes, bids and offers and are therefore classified as Level 2.\n•\nInsurance contracts\n- Insurance contracts are investments with various insurance companies. The contract value represents the best estimate of fair value. These contracts do not hold any specific assets. These investments are classified as Level 3.\n•\nReal estate collective funds\n– These funds are valued using the net asset value of the underlying properties. Net asset value is calculated using a combination of key inputs, such as revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates.\n•\nPooled investment funds\n- These are public investment vehicles valued using the net asset value. The net asset value is based on the value of the assets owned by the plan, less liabilities. These investments are not quoted on an active exchange.\nNordson Corporation 49\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe following tables present an analysis of changes during the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 in Level 3 plan assets, by plan asset class, for U.S. and international pension plans using significant unobservable inputs to measure fair value:\nContributions to pension plans in 2024 are estimated to be approximately $\n3,962\n.\nRetiree pension benefit payments, which include expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows:\nOther postretirement plans\n- We sponsor an unfunded postretirement health care benefit plan covering certain of our United States employees. Employees hired after January 1, 2002, are not eligible to participate in this plan. For eligible retirees under the age of\n65\nwho enroll in the plan, the plan is contributory in nature, with retiree contributions in the form of premiums that are adjusted annually. For eligible retirees age\n65\nand older who enroll in the plan, the plan delivers a benefit in the form of a Health Reimbursement Account (\"HRA\"), which retirees use for eligible reimbursable expenses, including premiums paid for purchase of a Medicare supplement plan or other out-of-pocket medical expenses such as deductibles or co-pays.\nNordson Corporation 50\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of the benefit obligations, accrued benefit cost and the amount recognized in financial statements for other postretirement plans is as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (gain) loss:\nNordson Corporation 51\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNet postretirement benefit costs include the following components:\nThe components of net\npostretirement\nbenefit cost other than service cost are included in Other – net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the valuation of postretirement benefits were as follows:\nThe weighted average health care trend rates reflect expected increases in the Company’s portion of the obligation.\nNet actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when exceeding the accounting corridor, which is set at 10 percent of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations.\nGains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan. If substantially all of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used.\nContributions to postretirement plans in 2024 are estimated to be approximately $\n2,808\n.\nRetiree postretirement benefit payments are anticipated to be paid as follows:\nNordson Corporation 52\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 7 —\nIncome taxes\nIncome before income taxes and income tax expense (benefit) are comprised of the following:\nA reconciliation of the U.S. statutory federal rate to the worldwide consolidated effective tax rate follows:\nDeferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in their operations. These undistributed earnings represent the post-income tax earnings under U.S. GAAP not adjusted for previously taxed income which aggregated approximately $\n1,533,889\nand $\n1,485,360\nat October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Should these earnings be distributed, applicable foreign tax credits, distributions of previously taxed income and utilization of other attributes would substantially offset taxes due upon the distribution. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these basis differences because of the multiple methods by which these differences could reverse and the impact of withholding, U.S. state and local taxes and currency translation considerations.\nAt October 31, 2023 and 2022, total unrecognized tax benefits were $\n8,002\nand $\n2,872\n, respectively. The amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $\n4,497\nand $\n2,769\nat October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2023, unrecognized tax benefits related primarily to domestic positions and, as recognized, a substantial portion of the gross unrecognized tax benefits were offset against assets recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNordson Corporation 53\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nAt October 31, 2023 and 2022, we had accrued interest and penalty expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $\n401\nand $\n541\n, respectively. We include interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as other income (expense).\nWe are subject to United States Federal income tax as well as income taxes in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination in the U.S. by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for the years 2020 through 2023; years prior to 2020 year are closed to further examination by the IRS. Generally, major state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination for years after 2017. Within the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that certain statute of limitations periods would expire, which could result in a minimal decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits.\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nAt October 31, 2023, we had $\n19,299\nof tax credit carryforwards, $\n11,831\nof which expires in 2028-2033 and $\n7,468\nof which has an indefinite carryforward period. We also had $\n35,906\nof state operating loss carryforwards, $\n36,850\nof foreign operating loss carryforwards, and a $\n3,570\ncapital loss carryforward, of which $\n52,330\nwill expire in 2024 through 2038, and $\n23,997\nof which has an indefinite carryforward period. The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $\n13,602\nin 2023 and a decrease of $\n4,011\nin 2022. The valuation allowance of $\n23,732\nat October 31, 2023, related primarily to tax credits and loss carryforwards that may expire before being realized. We continue to assess the need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets based on determinations of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized.\nNordson Corporation 54\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 8 —\nBank lines of credit\nBank lines of credit are summarized as follows:\nNote 9 —\nLong-term debt\nA summary of long-term debt is as follows:\nRevolving credit agreement\n— In April 2019, we entered into a $\n850,000\nunsecured multi-currency credit facility with a group of banks, which amended, restated and extended our then existing syndicated revolving credit agreement. This facility had a five-year term expiring in April 2024 and included a $\n75,000\nsub-facility for swing-line loans. On April 17, 2023, we entered into an amendment to, among other things, replace LIBOR with SOFR, EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR for U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen borrowings, respectively. On June 6, 2023, this credit agreement was terminated and replaced by the New Credit Agreement (as defined below). At\nOctober 31, 2023\n, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.\nIn June 2023, we entered into a $\n1,150,000\nunsecured multi-currency credit facility with a group of banks, which provides for a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $\n300,000\n(the \"Term Loan Facility\"), maturing in June 2026, and a multicurrency revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $\n850,000\n(the \"Revolving Facility\"), maturing in June 2028 (the \"New Credit Agreement\"). The Company borrowed and has outstanding $\n300,000\non the Term Loan Facility and $\n248,000\non the Revolving Facility as of\nOctober 31, 2023\n. The Revolving Facility permits borrowing in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Sterling, Swiss Francs, Singapore Dollars, Yen, and each other currency approved by a Revolving Facility lender. The New Credit Agreement provides that the applicable margin for (i) RFR, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, and Eurodollar Loans will range from\n0.85\n% to\n1.20\n% and (ii) Base Rate Loans will range from\n0.00\n% to\n0.20\n%, in each case, based on the Company’s Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement and calculated on a consolidated net debt basis). Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement bear interest at (i) either a base rate or a SOFR rate, with respect to borrowings in U.S. dollars, (ii) a eurocurrency rate, with respect to borrowings in Euros and Yen, or (iii) Daily Simple RFR, with respect to borrowings in Sterling, Swiss Francs or Singapore Dollars, plus, in each case, an applicable margin (and, solely in the case of Singapore Dollars, a spread adjustment). The applicable margin is based on the Company’s Leverage Ratio. The weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2023 was\n6.27\n%.\nSenior notes, due 2023-2025\n— These unsecured fixed-rate notes entered into in 2012 with a group of insurance companies have a remaining weighted-average life of\n1.00\nyear. The weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2023 was\n3.10\npercent.\nSenior notes, due 2023-2027\n— These unsecured fixed-rate notes entered into in 2015 with a group of insurance companies have a remaining weighted-average life of\n1.98\nyears. The weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2023 was\n3.11\npercent.\nNordson Corporation 55\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nSenior notes, due 2023-2030\n—\nThese unsecured fixed-rate notes entered in 2018 with a group of insurance companies have a remaining weighted-average life of\n2.88\nyears. The weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2023 was\n3.97\npercent.\nEuro loan, due 2023\n— The euro term loan facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited\nwas due in March 2023 and was repaid.\n5.600% Notes due 2028 and 5.800% Notes due 2033\n— In September 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering (the \"Offering\") of $\n350,000\naggregate principal amount of\n5.600\n% Notes due 2028 and $\n500,000\naggregate principal amount of\n5.800\n% Notes due 2033.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants at October 31, 2023 and the amount we could borrow would not have been limited by any debt covenants.\nAnnual maturities\n— The annual ma\nturities of long-term debt for the five years subsequent to October 31, 2023, are as follows: $\n115,662\nin 2024; $\n85,643\nin 2025; $\n350,000\nin 2026; $\n10,000\nin 2027 and $\n638,000\nin 2028.\nNote 10 —\nLeases\nWe review new contracts to determine if the contracts include a lease. To the extent a lease agreement includes an extension option that is reasonably certain to be exercised, we have recognized those amounts as part of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We combine lease and non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, in the calculation of the lease assets and related liabilities. As most lease agreements do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate (\"IBR\") based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments and to help classify the lease as operating or financing. We calculate the IBR based on a bond yield curve which considers secured borrowing rates based on our credit rating and current economic environment, as well as other publicly available data.\nWe lease certain manufacturing facilities, warehouse space, machinery and equipment, and vehicles. We often have options to renew lease terms for buildings and other assets. We evaluate renewal and termination options at the lease commencement date to determine if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option on the basis of economic factors. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with variable lease payments recognized in the period those payments occur. Variable payments for leases primarily relate to future rates or amounts, miles, or other quantifiable usage factors which are not determinable at the time the lease agreement commences. Finance lease assets are recorded in Property, plant and equipment – net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with related amortization recorded in depreciation expense on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As of October 31, 2023, we had no material leases that had yet to commence.\nAdditional lease information is summarized below for the twelve months ended October 31:\n(1)\nLease costs are recorded in both Cost of sales and Selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSupplemental cash flow information is summarized below for the twelve months ended October 31, 2023:\nNordson Corporation 56\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for five years and thereafter to the operating and finance lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2023. The reconciliation excludes short-term leases that are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRental expense for operating leases during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n22,095\n, $\n20,479\nand $\n20,618\n, respectively.\nCapitalized net finance leases included in property, plant and equipment during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022 was $\n16,310\nand $\n15,176\n, respectively.\nNote 11 —\nFair value measurements\nThe inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are classified into the following categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nThe following tables present the classification of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n(a)\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from receivables, payables, intercompany receivables, intercompany payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies.\nNordson Corporation 57\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nForeign exchange contracts are valued using market exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges.\n(b)\nNet assets of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries. The notional amount of our net investment hedge contracts as of October 31, 2023 was $\n801,857\n.\n(c)\nExecutive officers and other highly compensated employees may defer up to\n100\npercent of their salary and annual cash incentive compensation and for executive officers, up to\n90\npercent of their long-term incentive compensation, into various non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Deferrals can be allocated to various market performance measurement funds. Changes in the value of compensation deferred under these plans are recognized each period based on the fair value of the underlying measurement funds.\nFair value disclosures related to goodwill are disclosed in Note 5.\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, other than cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, are shown in the table below.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nLong-term debt is valued by discounting future cash flows at currently available rates for borrowing arrangements with similar terms and conditions, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of long-term debt is shown net of unamortized debt issuance costs and bond discounts as described in Note 9.\nNote 12 —\nDerivative financial instruments\nWe operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currency transactions occur and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts usually have maturities of\n90\ndays or less and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars at maturity, at rates stated in the contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in each accounting period in “Other – net” on the Consolidated Statement of Income together with the transaction gain or loss from the related balance sheet position. The settlement of these contracts is recorded in operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIn 2023, we recognized net losses of $\n3,041\non foreign currency forward contracts and net loss of $\n4,701\nfrom the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. In 2022, we recognized net losses of $\n4,937\non foreign currency forward contracts and net gains of $\n11,207\nfrom the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. In 2021, we recognized net gains of $\n1,485\non foreign currency forward contracts and net losses of $\n7,411\nfrom the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities are included in Receivables-net and Accrued liabilities, respectively in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNordson Corporation 58\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes, by currency, the contracts outstanding at October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nWe are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash deposits and foreign currency forward contracts. We periodically monitor the credit ratings of these counterparties in order to minimize our exposure. Our customers represent a wide variety of industries and geographic regions. As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\nNet Investment Hedges\nNet assets of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We may utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company designated €\n180,000\nof borrowings as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. In June 2023, the hedge was terminated. Any increases or decreases related to the remeasurement or termination of the €\n180,000\nborrowing into U.S. dollars were recorded in the currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A loss of $\n2,467\n, net of tax, was recorded in 2023 on these net investment hedges.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company designated €\n760,000\nof borrowings as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. In September 2023, the hedge was terminated. Any increases or decreases related to the remeasurement or termination of the €\n760,000\nborrowing into U.S. dollars were recorded in the currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A gain of $\n7,846\n, net of tax, was recorded in 2023 on these net investment hedges.\nDuring 2023, the Company entered into various cross currency swaps between the U.S. Dollar and Euro, Japanese Yen, Taiwan Dollar and Chinese Yuan which were designated as a hedges of our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Any increases or decreases related to the remeasurement of the hedges are recorded in the currency translation component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying investments. A gain of $\n10,165\n, net of tax, was recorded in 2023.\nNordson Corporation 59\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nChanges in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in current net earnings. The settlement of net investment hedges is recorded in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nA net gain of $\n15,544\n, net of tax of $\n4,643\n, was recorded in 2023 related to all net investment hedges, which is included in foreign currency translation adjustments in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of our net investment contracts designated as net investment hedges in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2023:\nNote 13 —\nCapital shares\nPreferred\n— We have authorized\n10,000\nSeries A convertible preferred shares without par value.\nNo\npreferred shares were outstanding in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nCommon\n— We have\n160,000\nauthorized common shares without par value. At October 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\n98,023\ncommon shares issued. At October 31, 2023 and 2022, the number of outstanding common shares, net of treasury shares, was\n57,007\nand\n57,111\n, respectively.\nCommon shares repurchased as part of publicly announced programs during 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nThese amounts exclude share repurchases associated with employee equity award exercises and vesting.\nNote 14 —\nStock-based compensation\nDuring the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved the Nordson Corporation 2021 Stock Incentive and Award Plan (the “2021 Plan”) as the successor to the Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive and Award Plan (the \"2012 Plan\"). The 2021 plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, performance shares, cash awards and other stock or performance-based incentives. A maximum of\n900\ncommon shares were authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan plus the number of shares that were available to be granted under the 2012 Plan, as well as issuable under the CyberOptics equity plan. As of October 31, 2023, a total of\n2,009\ncommon shares were available to be granted under the 2021 Plan.\nStock options\n— Nonqualified or incentive stock options may be granted to our employees and directors. Generally, options granted to employees may be exercised beginning\none year\nfrom the date of grant at a rate not exceeding\n25\npercent per year and expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant. Vesting accelerates upon a qualified termination in connection with a change in control. In the event of termination of employment due to early retirement or normal retirement at age\n65\n, options granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination are forfeited, and vesting continues post retirement for all other unvested options granted. In the event of disability or death, all unvested stock options granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination fully vest. Termination for any other reason results in forfeiture of unvested options and vested options in certain circumstances. The amortized cost of options is accelerated if the retirement eligibility date occurs before the normal vesting date. Option exercises are satisfied through the issuance of treasury shares on a first-in, first-out basis. We recognized compensation expense related to stock options of $\n6,655\n, $\n7,265\nand $\n6,946\nfor 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNordson Corporation 60\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes activity related to stock options during 2023:\nSummarized information on currently outstanding options follows:\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was $\n5,108\nof total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options. That cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately\n1.6\nyears.\nThe fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\nThe weighted-average expected volatility used to value options granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was\n30.6\npercent,\n30.6\npercent and\n31.0\npercent, respectively.\nHistorical information was the primary basis for the selection of the expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the expected lives of the options. The risk-free interest rate was selected based upon yields of United States Treasury issues with terms equal to the expected life of the option being valued.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n77.99\n, $\n78.88\nand $\n56.02\n, respectively.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n23,706\n, $\n15,376\nand $\n32,791\n, respectively.\nCash received from the exercise of stock options for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $\n21,373\n, $\n12,124\nand $\n31,780\n, respectively.\nRestricted shares and restricted share units\n— We may grant restricted shares and/or restricted share units to our employees and directors. These shares or units may not be transferred for a designated period of time (generally\none\nto\nthree years\n) defined at the date of grant\n.\nWe may also grant continuation awards in the form of restricted share units with cliff vesting and a performance measure that must be achieved for the restricted share units to vest.\nFor employee recipients, in the event of termination of employment due to early retirement, with consent of the Company, restricted shares and units granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination are forfeited, and other restricted shares and units vest on a pro-rata basis, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of termination of employment due to normal retirement at age\n65\n, restricted shares and units granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination are forfeited, and, for other restricted shares and units, the restriction period applicable to restricted shares will lapse and the shares will vest and be transferable and all unvested units will become vested in full, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of a recipient's disability or death, all restricted shares and units granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination fully vest.\nNordson Corporation 61\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nTermination for any other reason prior to the lapse of any restrictions or vesting of units results in forfeiture of the shares or units.\nFor non-employee directors, all restrictions lapse in the event of disability or death of the non-employee director. Termination of service as a director for any other reason within one year of date of grant results in a pro-rata vesting of shares or units.\nAs shares or units are issued, stock-based compensation equivalent to the fair market value on the date of grant is expensed over the vesting period.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to restricted shares during 2023:\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was\nno\nunrecognized compensation cost related to restricted shares. The amount charged to expense related to restricted shares was $\n336\n, $\n1,096\nand $\n2,054\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts included common share dividends of $\n5\n, $\n19\nand $\n43\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to restricted share units in 2023:\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was $\n9,613\nof remaining expense to be recognized related to outstanding restricted share units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.0\nyears. The amounts charged to expense related to restricted share units in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n8,765\n, $\n8,403\nand $\n6,264\n, respectively. Restricted share unit expense increased beginning in 2021 compared to prior years as the granting of restricted share units has generally replaced the granting of stock options for key employees.\nPerformance share incentive awards\n— Executive officers and selected other key employees are eligible to receive common share-based incentive awards. Payouts, in the form of unrestricted common shares, vary based on the degree to which corporate financial performance exceeds predetermined threshold, target and maximum performance goals over\nthree-year\nperformance periods. No payout will occur unless threshold performance is achieved\n.\nThe amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered. The calculations are based upon the grant date fair value which is principally driven by the stock price on the date of grant or a Monte Carlo valuation for awards with market conditions. The per share values were $\n231.34\n, $\n211.25\nand $\n214.51\nfor 2023; $\n260.60\n, $\n273.50\nand $\n221.94\nfor 2022; and $\n202.05\nfor 2021. The amount charged to expense for executive officers and selected other key employees in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $\n6,543\n, $\n13,626\nand $\n7,178\n, respectively.  As of October 31, 2023, there was $\n5,939\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to performance share incentive awards.\nDeferred compensation\n— Our executive officers and other highly compensated employees may elect to defer up to\n100\npercent of their base pay and cash incentive compensation and, for executive officers, up to\n90\npercent of their share-based performance incentive award payout each year. Additional share units are credited for quarterly dividends paid on our common shares. Expense related to dividends paid under this plan was $\n107\n, $\n72\nand $\n96\nfor 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n.\nDeferred directors’ compensation\n— Non-employee directors may defer all or part of their cash and equity-based compensation until retirement. Cash compensation may be deferred as cash or as share equivalent units. Deferred cash amounts are recorded as liabilities, and share equivalent units are recorded as equity. Additional share equivalent units are earned when common share dividends are declared.\nNordson Corporation 62\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes activity related to director deferred compensation share equivalent units during 2023:\nThe amount charged to expense related to director deferred compensation was $\n309\n, $\n305\nand $\n262\nin 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nShares reserved for future issuance\n— At October 31, 2023, there were\n1,391\nof common shares reserved for future issuance through the exercise of outstanding options or rights\n.\nNote 15 —\nOperating segments and geographic area data\nWe conduct business in\nthree\nprimary operating segments: Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and Advanced Technology Solutions. The composition of segments and measure of segment profitability is consistent with that used by our chief operating decision maker. The primary measure used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing performance is operating profit, which equals sales less cost of sales and certain operating expenses. Items below the operating profit line of the Consolidated Statement of Income (interest and investment income, interest expense and other income/expense) are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and are not presented by operating segment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1.\nIndustrial Precision Solutions:\nThis segment is focused on delivering proprietary dispensing and processing technology, both standard and highly customized equipment, to diverse end markets. Product lines commonly reduce material consumption, increase line efficiency through precision dispense and measurement and control, and enhance product brand and appearance.

Corporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes, leases, headquarter facilities, the major portion of our enterprise management systems and intangible assets.\nWe have significant sales and long-lived assets in the following geographic areas:\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment - net and operating right of use lease assets.\nNordson Corporation 64\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of total assets for reportable segments to total consolidated assets is as follows:\nNote 16 —\nSupplemental information for the statement of cash flows\nNote 17 —\nContingencies\nWe are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental, product liability, patent, contract, employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business.\nIncluding the environmental matter discussed below, after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows.\nWe have voluntarily agreed with the City of New Richmond, Wisconsin and other Potentially Responsible Parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the City of New Richmond municipal landfill (the “Site”) and the construction of a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the Site. At October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, our accrual for the ongoing operation, maintenance and monitoring obligation at the Site was $\n231\nand $\n266\n, respectively. The liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations. The accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities, the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations, and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements. Consequently, our liability could be greater than our current estimate. However, we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nNordson Corporation 65\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Nordson Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nUsing criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (\"2013 framework\"), Nordson’s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023.\nWe completed the acquisitions of the ARAG Group and its subsidiaries (\"ARAG Group\" or \"ARAG\") and CyberOptics Corporation (\"CyberOptics\") on August 24, 2023 and November 3, 2022, respectively. As permitted by SEC guidance, the scope of our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023 did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the ARAG Group and CyberOptics. The results of the ARAG Group and CyberOptics are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date each business was acquired. The combined total assets of the ARAG Group and CyberOptics represented 30% of our total assets at October 31, 2023. The combined net revenues represented 4% of consolidated revenues for the year ended October 31, 2023 and the combined net income\nfor the year ended\nOctober 31, 2023\ndid not have a material impact on the Company’s operations\n.\nBased on our assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2023.\nThe independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023. Their report is included herein.\nNordson Corporation 66\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Nordson Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Nordson Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of ARAG Group and its subsidiaries (ARAG Group or ARAG) and CyberOptics Corporation (CyberOptics), which are included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and on a combined basis constitu\nted 30% of total assets as of October 31, 2023 and 4% of total revenues for the year then ended. The combined net income for the year\nthen ended did not have a material impact on the Company’s operations. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the ARAG Group and CyberOptics.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2023, and the related notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated December 20, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nCleveland, Ohio\nDecember 20, 2023\nNordson Corporation 67\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nordson Corporation (the Company) as of\nOctober 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nOctober 31, 2023\n, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at\nOctober 31, 2023\nand\n2022\n, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nOctober 31, 2023\n, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nOctober 31, 2023\n, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated\nDecember 20, 2023\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.
