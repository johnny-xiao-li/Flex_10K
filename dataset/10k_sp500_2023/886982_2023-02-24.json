    "text": "Introduction\nGoldman Sachs is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Our purpose is to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. Our goal, reflected in our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is to deliver the full range of our services and expertise to support our clients in a more accessible, comprehensive and efficient manner, across businesses and product areas.\nWhen we use the terms “Goldman Sachs,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term “our subsidiaries,” we mean the consolidated subsidiaries of Group Inc. References to “this Form 10-K” are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. All references to 2022, 2021 and 2020 refer to our years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nGroup Inc. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company (FHC) regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank.\nOur Business Segments\nWe manage and report our activities in three business segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Global Banking & Markets generates revenues from investment banking fees, including advisory, and equity and debt underwriting fees, Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) intermediation and financing activities and Equities intermediation and financing activities, as well as relationship lending and acquisition financing (and related hedges) and investing activities related to our Global Banking & Markets activities. Asset & Wealth Management generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending, equity investments and debt investments. Platform Solutions generates revenues from consumer platforms, and transaction banking and other platform businesses.\nThe chart below presents our three business segments and their revenue sources.\nPrior to the fourth quarter of 2022, we managed and reported our activities in the following four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, consistent with our previously announced organizational changes, we began managing and reporting our activities in\nthree\nnew segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Our new segments reflect the following primary changes:\n•\nGlobal Banking & Markets is a new segment that includes the results previously reported in Investment Banking and Global Markets, and additionally includes the results from equity and debt investments related to our Global Banking & Markets activities, previously reported in Asset Management.\n•\nAsset & Wealth Management is a new segment that includes the results previously reported in Asset Management and Wealth Management (previously included in Consumer & Wealth Management), and additionally includes the results from our direct-to-consumer banking business, which includes lending, deposit-taking and investing, previously reported in Consumer & Wealth Management, as well as the results from middle-market lending related to our asset management activities, previously reported in Investment Banking.\n•\nPlatform Solutions is a new segment that includes the results from our consumer platforms, such as partnerships offering credit cards and point-of-sale financing, previously reported in Consumer & Wealth Management, and the results from our transaction banking business, previously reported in Investment Banking.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGlobal Banking & Markets\nGlobal Banking & Markets serves public and private sector clients and we seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including corporations, governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with our advisory and underwriting activities serving as the main initial point of contact. We make markets and facilitate client transactions in fixed income, currency, commodity and equity products and offer market expertise on a global basis. In addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions on, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. Our clients include companies that raise capital and funding to grow and strengthen their businesses, and engage in mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense, restructurings and spin-offs, as well as companies that are professional market participants, who buy and sell financial products and manage risk, and investment entities whose ultimate clients include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash.\nAs a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times, we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory).\nWe execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-through securities). We also execute transactions for our clients in less liquid markets (such as mid-cap corporate bonds, emerging market currencies and certain non-agency mortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients’ risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs, as well as derivative transactions related to client advisory and underwriting activities.\nThrough our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms, including\nMarquee\n, and operates globally where markets are open for trading.\nMarquee\nprovides institutional investors with market intelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade execution across multiple asset classes.\nOur businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research business, which, as of December 2022, provided fundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies worldwide and on approximately 50 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities.\nOur activities are organized by asset class and include both “cash” and “derivative” instruments. “Cash” refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). “Derivative” refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa).\nGlobal Banking & Markets generates revenues from the following:\nInvestment banking fees.\nWe provide advisory and underwriting services to our clients.\nInvestment banking fees includes the following:\n•\nAdvisory.\nWe have been a leader for many years in providing advisory services, including strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs.

Transaction banking revenues include net interest income attributed to transaction banking deposits.\nBusiness Continuity and Information Security\nBusiness continuity and information security, including cybersecurity, are high priorities for us. Their importance has been highlighted by (i) the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the work-from-home arrangements implemented by companies worldwide in response, including us, (ii) numerous highly publicized events in recent years, including cyber attacks against financial institutions, governmental agencies, large consumer-based companies, software and information technology service providers and other organizations, some of which have resulted in the unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information and other sensitive or confidential information, the theft and destruction of corporate information and requests for ransom payments, and (iii) extreme weather events.\nOur Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or of our systems, and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a BHC, our Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program is also subject to review by the FRB. The key elements of the program are crisis management, business continuity, technology resilience, business recovery, assurance and verification, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and our own information from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nHuman Capital Management\nOur people are our greatest asset. We believe that a major strength and principal reason for our success is the quality, dedication, determination and collaboration of our people, which enables us to serve our clients, generate long-term value for our shareholders and contribute to the broader community. We invest heavily in developing and supporting our people throughout their careers, and we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, high standards of business ethics, diversity, teamwork and cooperation among our employees worldwide.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe strength of our culture, our ability to execute our strategy, and our relationships with clients all depend on a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment that encourages a wide range of perspectives. We believe that diversity at all levels of our organization, from entry-level analysts to senior management, as well as the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) is essential to our sustainability. As of December 2022, approximately 57% of our Board was diverse by race, gender or sexual orientation. Our management team works closely with our Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee to continue to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels. In addition, we have Inclusion and Diversity Committees across regions, which promote an environment that values different perspectives, challenges conventional thinking and maximizes the potential of all our people.\nWe believe that increased diversity, including diversity of experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status, in addition to being a social imperative, is vital to our commercial success through the creativity that it fosters. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive action plan with aspirational diversity hiring and representation goals which are set forth below and are focused on cultivating an inclusive environment for all our colleagues.\nDiverse leadership is crucial to our long-term success and to driving innovation, and we have implemented and expanded outreach and career advancement programs for rising diverse executive talent. For example, we are focused on providing diverse vice presidents the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership platforms, including through programs, such as our Vice President Sponsorship Initiative focused on high-performing women, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian and LGBTQ+ vice presidents across the globe. Many other career development initiatives are aimed at fostering diverse talent at the analyst and associate level, including the Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, the Hispanic/Latinx Analyst Initiative and the Women’s Career Strategies Initiative. Our global and regional Inclusion Networks and Interest Forums are open to all professionals at Goldman Sachs to promote and advance connectivity, understanding, inclusion and diversity.\nProgress Toward Aspirational Goals.\nReflecting our efforts to increase diversity, the composition of our most recent partnership class was 29% women professionals, 24% Asian professionals, 9% Black professionals, 3% Hispanic/Latinx professionals, 3% LGBTQ+ professionals and 3% professionals who are military/veterans. The composition of our most recent managing director class was 30% women professionals, 28% Asian professionals, 5% Black professionals, 5% Hispanic/Latinx professionals, 3% LGBTQ+ professionals and 3% professionals who are military/veterans.\nWe have also set forth the following aspirational goals:\n•\nWe aim for analyst and associate hiring (which accounts for over 70% of our annual hiring) to achieve representation of 50% women professionals, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the U.K. In 2022, our analyst and associate hires included 44% women professionals, 10% Black professionals and 13% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 17% Black professionals in the U.K.\n•\nWe aim for women professionals to represent 40% of our vice presidents globally by 2025 and 30% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K. by 2023, while also endeavoring for women employees to comprise 50% of all of our employees globally over time. As of December 2022, women professionals represented 33% of our vice president population globally and 31% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K., and women employees represented 41% of all of our employees globally.\n•\nWe aim for Black professionals to represent 7% of our vice president population in the Americas and in the U.K., and for Hispanic/Latinx professionals to represent 9% of our vice president population in the Americas, both by 2025. As of December 2022, Black professionals represented 4% of our vice president population in the Americas and 5% in the U.K., and Hispanic/Latinx professionals represented 6% of our vice president population in the Americas.\n•\nWe aim to double the number of campus hires in the U.S. recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by 2025 relative to 2020.\nThe metrics above are based on self-identification.\nTalent Development and Retention\nWe seek to help our people achieve their full potential by investing in them and supporting a culture of continuous development. Our goals are to maximize individual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation, reinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people contribute positively to their communities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nInstilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars facilitated by our Learning & Engagement team. To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify our culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders. We maintain a variety of programs aimed at employees’ professional growth and leadership development, including initiatives, such as our Vice President and Managing Director Leadership Acceleration Initiatives and Partner Development Initiative.\nEnhancing our people’s experience of internal mobility is a key focus, as we believe that this will inspire employees, help retain top talent and create diverse experiences to build future leaders.\nAnother important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees whom they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee’s performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. We have also implemented “The Three Conversations at GS” through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in mid-year on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals.\nWe believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and support community organizations through completing local service projects strengthens our people’s bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2022, our people volunteered approximately 86,000 hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with approximately 17,000 employees partnering with approximately 500 nonprofit organizations on approximately 1,200 community projects.\nWellness\nWe recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional, lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. We provide a number of policies for our employees that support taking time away from the office when needed, including 20 weeks of parental leave, family care leave and bereavement leave. In 2022, we also enhanced our vacation policies for our employees, allowing managing directors to take time off, when needed, without a fixed vacation day entitlement and adding a minimum of two additional vacation days for all other employees, as well as setting a minimum annual expected vacation usage of 15 days. For longer-tenured employees, we offer an unpaid sabbatical leave. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. We increased the availability of these resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings to enhance access to support, with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of our people, and enhancing their effectiveness and productivity.\nIn addition, to support the financial wellness of our employees, we offer a variety of resources that help them manage their personal financial health and decision-making, including financial education information sessions, live and on-demand webinars, articles and interactive digital tools.\nGlobal Reach and Strategic Locations\nAs a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic approach to attracting, developing and managing a global workforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December 2022, we had headcount of 48,500, offices in over 35 countries and 52% of our headcount was based in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 29% in Asia. Our employees come from over 180 countries and speak more than 150 languages as of December 2022.\nIn addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore, Warsaw and Hyderabad. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence.\nAs of December 2022, 41% of our employees were working in strategic locations. We believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSustainability\nWe have a long-standing commitment to sustainability. Our two priorities in this area are helping clients across industries decarbonize their businesses to support their transition to a low-carbon economy (Climate Transition) and to advance solutions that expand access, increase affordability, and drive outcomes to support sustainable economic growth (Inclusive Growth). Our strategy is to advance these two priorities through our work with our clients, and with strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own, as well as through our supply chain.\nWe have established a Sustainable Finance Group, which serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm, including commercial efforts alongside our businesses, to advance Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. We have also created the role of Global Head of Sustainability and Inclusive Growth, which, like our\nOne Goldman Sachs\ninitiative, is intended to facilitate the application of our full capabilities across both Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. Our sustainable finance-related efforts continue to evolve. For example, we recently launched the Sustainable Banking Group, a group focused on supporting our corporate clients in reducing their direct and indirect carbon emissions.\nOur activities relating to sustainability present both financial and nonfinancial risks, and we have processes for managing these risks, similar to the other risks we face. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability risks affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. We have also implemented an Environmental Policy Framework to guide our overall approach to sustainability issues. We apply this Framework when evaluating transactions for environmental and social risks and impacts. Our employees also receive training with respect to environmental and social risks, including for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for these risks. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Other Risk Management — Climate Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our climate risk management.\nAs a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the importance of Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth for our business. In February 2021, we issued our inaugural sustainability bond of $800 million, and in June 2022 we issued our second benchmark sustainability bond of $700 million. These issuances align with our sustainable finance framework for future issuances and fund a range of on-balance sheet sustainable finance activity. We believe we can advance sustainability by partnering with our clients across our businesses, including by developing new sustainability-linked financing solutions, offering strategic advice, or coinvesting alongside our clients in clean energy companies. We have announced a target to deploy $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity by the beginning of 2030. As of December 2022, we achieved approximately 55% of that goal, with the majority dedicated to Climate Transition.\nWith respect to Climate Transition, we have announced our commitment to align our financing activities with a net-zero-by-2050 pathway. In that context, we have set an initial set of targets for 2030 focused on three sectors — power, oil and gas, and auto manufacturing — where we see an opportunity to proactively engage our clients and investors, deploy capital required for transition, and invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy. Carbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our supply chain. In 2015, we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and business travel, ahead of our 2020 goal announced in 2009. We have expanded our operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.\nIn addition to Climate Transition, our approach to sustainability also centers on Inclusive Growth where we seek to drive solutions that expand access, increase affordability, and drive outcomes to advance sustainable economic growth. We have sponsored initiatives, such as\nOne Million Black Women, Launch With GS,\nthe\nUrban Investment Group, 10,000 Women\nand\n10,000 Small Businesses\n. An overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity and inclusion as an imperative for us, as well as for our clients and their boards. These efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we have established in areas where we have identified gaps or believe we are able to drive even greater impact through collaboration. We believe our ability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on the strengths and talents of our people, and we recognize that our people are able to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work environment. See “Business — Human Capital Management” for information about our human capital management goals, programs and policies.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCompetition\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors provide investment banking, market-making and asset management services, private banking and lending, commercial lending, point-of-sale financing, credit cards, transaction banking, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, and make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. Our competitors include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. Some of our competitors operate globally and others regionally, and we compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price.\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments.\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them.\nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, consumer, wealth management and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward low-commission trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution. We and other banks also compete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer. Increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing.\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that we cannot or may choose not to provide. Our competitors may also develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience.\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based banking organizations and give non-U.S.-based banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLikewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. The impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described further in “Regulation” below.\nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See “Regulation — Compensation Practices” and “Risk Factors — Competition — Our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about such regulation.\nRegulation\nAs a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes applicable to our operations have been, and continue to be, subject to significant changes.\nNew regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described below. The impacts of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals described below, are uncertain and will not be known until such changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations.\nGroup Inc. is a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and examination by the FRB, which is our primary regulator.\nUnder the system of “functional regulation” established under the GLB Act, the primary regulators of our U.S. non-bank subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. Such “functionally regulated” subsidiaries include broker-dealers and security-based swap dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, entities registered with or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities.\nOur principal subsidiaries operating in the U.S. include GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co., LLC (GS&Co.), J. Aron & Company LLC (J. Aron) and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.\nGS Bank USA is our principal U.S. bank subsidiary and is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). GS Bank USA also has a London branch, which is regulated by the FCA and PRA, and a Tokyo branch, which is regulated by the Japan Financial Services Agency. We conduct a number of our activities partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: corporate loans (including leveraged lending); securities-based and collateralized loans; consumer loans (including installment loans, such as point-of-sale loans, and credit card loans); small business loans (including installment, lines of credit and credit cards); residential mortgages; transaction banking; deposit-taking; interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; and agency lending.\nGS&Co. is our principal U.S. broker-dealer and is registered as a broker-dealer, a securities-based swap dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, have adopted rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&Co.\nOur principal subsidiaries operating in Europe include: Goldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI); Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE); and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur E.U. subsidiaries are subject to various E.U. regulations, as well as national laws, including those implementing European directives. GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). GSBE’s London branch is regulated by the FCA. GSBE engages in certain activities primarily in the E.U., including underwriting and market making in debt and equity securities and derivatives, investment, asset and wealth management services, deposit-taking, lending (including securities lending), and financial advisory services. GSBE is also a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. sovereigns. As a foreign bank subsidiary of GS Bank USA, GSBE is subject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under the FRB’s Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting and market making in equity securities based on GSBE’s and/or GS Bank USA’s capital.\nGSPIC is an investment firm regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) and the French Financial Markets Authority. GSPIC’s activities include certain activities that GSBE is prevented from undertaking. GSPIC's application to ACPR in October 2021 to become a credit institution remains pending.\nGSI is a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated investment firm, and GSIB is a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. As an investment firm, GSI is subject to prudential requirements applicable to banks, including capital and liquidity requirements. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K. and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and with the SEC as a securities-based swap dealer. GSIB engages in lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities and is a primary dealer for U.K. government bonds. GSI and GSIB maintain branches outside of the U.K. and are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where they are located.\nOur principal subsidiary operating in Asia is Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL). GSJCL is our regulated Japanese broker-dealer subsidiary and is regulated by Japan’s Financial Services Agency, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others.\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\nThe Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation. However, the Basel Committee’s standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards. The implications of Basel Committee standards and related regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop.\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements.\nWe and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on the Basel Committee’s framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ tailoring framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to “Category I” standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA are “Advanced approach” banking organizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.\nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements Directive, as amended (CRD), which are largely based on Basel III. The most recent amendments to the CRR and CRD (respectively, CRR II and CRD V) include changes to the liquidity, market risk, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks. These changes have been applicable in the E.U. since June 2021. From June 2022, the CRR requires large institutions with securities traded on a regulated market of a member state to make qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to environmental, social and governance risks on an annual basis. Under an E.U. proposal, these requirements would apply to our E.U.-regulated entities beginning in January 2025.\nGSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and liquidity frameworks, which are also largely based on Basel III and are predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity frameworks. The most recent amendments to the U.K. frameworks include changes to the liquidity, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks. The changes have been applicable in the U.K. since January 2022.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios.\nAs Advanced approach banking organizations, we and GS Bank USA calculate risk-based capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Both the Advanced Capital Rules and the Standardized Capital Rules include minimum risk-based capital requirements and additional capital conservation buffer requirements that must be satisfied solely with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer requirement in full would result in constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the organization’s “eligible retained income,” defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four quarters. For Group Inc., the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (SCB) (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and both a countercyclical buffer and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer.\nThe SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests and our planned common stock dividends and is likely to change over time based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. See “Stress Tests and Capital Planning” below. The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to Category I, II or III standards, including us and GS Bank USA. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in the future, including due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes. As a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have a rule that implements the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts (SA-CCR). Under the rule, “Advanced approach” banking organizations are required to use SA-CCR for calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below.\nThe capital requirements applicable to GSBE, GSI and GSIB include both minimum requirements and buffers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10‑K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10‑K for information about our capital ratios and those of GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and GSIB.\nThe Basel Committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective (D-SIBs). Depending on how these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they may apply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of G-SIBs. These guidelines are in addition to the framework for G-SIBs, but are more principles-based. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not designated any D-SIBs. The CRD and CRR provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements, according to their degree of systemic importance (O-SII buffers). BaFin has identified GSBE as an O-SII in Germany and set an O-SII buffer.\nIn the U.K., the PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an O-SII but has not applied an O-SII buffer.\nThe Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk as part of its Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). These revisions are expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations and large broker-dealers subject to bank capital requirements. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized and internal model-based approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators will have implemented the revised framework by January 1, 2023. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the revised framework. Under the CRR, E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE, commenced reporting their market risk calculations under the revised framework in the third quarter of 2021. In November 2022, the PRA issued a consultation paper to implement this framework.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (Basel III Revisions). These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committee’s standardized and internal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators will have implemented these standards and that the new floor will be phased in through January 1, 2028. The U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the Basel III Revisions for purposes of their risk-based capital ratios. The European Commission proposed rules to implement the Basel III Revisions in October 2021 and in November 2022, the Council of the E.U. adopted its general approach on implementing the Basel III revisions. The proposed E.U. rules contemplate amendments to the CRR and the CRD, referred to as CRR III and CRD VI, generally taking effect in January 2025. In November 2022, the PRA issued a consultation on the implementation of the Basel III Revisions, with a proposed January 2025 effective date. Under the PRA consultation, our U.K. subsidiaries are not expected to be subject to a floor on internally modeled capital requirements.\nThe Basel Committee has published an updated securitization framework and a revised G-SIB assessment methodology, but the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing them. The updated securitization framework has been implemented in the E.U. and U.K.\nIn December 2022, the Basel Committee published a final standard on the prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures. The Basel Committee contemplates that national regulators will have incorporated the standard into local capital requirements by January 1, 2025. U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and E.U. and U.K. authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the standards.\nLeverage Ratios.\nUnder the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. As a G-SIB, the SLR requirements applicable to us include both a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement, which operates in the same manner as the risk-based buffer requirements described above. In April 2018, the FRB and the OCC issued a proposed rule which would (i) replace the current 2% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, including us, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge and (ii) revise the 6% SLR requirement for Category I banks, such as GS Bank USA, to be “well capitalized” with a requirement equal to 3% plus 50% of their parent’s G-SIB surcharge. This proposal, together with the adopted rule requiring use of SA-CCR for purposes of calculating the SLR, would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2017.\nGSBE and certain of our U.K. entities are also subject to requirements relating to leverage ratios, which are generally based on the Basel Committee leverage ratio standards.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about our and GS Bank USA’s Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI’s leverage ratio.\nLiquidity Ratios.\nThe Basel Committee’s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\nThe LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committee’s framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We and GS Bank USA are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. See “Available Information” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management — Liquidity Regulatory Framework” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about our average daily LCR.\nGSBE is subject to the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council, and GSI and GSIB are subject to the rules approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities' LCR rules. These rules are generally consistent with the Basel Committee’s framework.\nThe NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and off-balance sheet activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. The Basel Committee’s NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.\nWe are subject to the U.S. NSFR rule and we will be required to publicly disclose our quarterly average daily NSFR semi-annually. We will begin doing so in August 2023. The CRR implements the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE. The NSFR requirement implemented in the U.K. is applicable to both GSI and GSIB.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe FRB’s enhanced prudential standards require BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. GSBE also has its own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA’s ILAAP.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Overview and Structure of Risk Management” and “— Liquidity Risk Management — Liquidity Regulatory Framework” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity.\nStress Tests and Capital Planning.\nThe FRB’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As required by the FRB, we perform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the results into an annual capital plan, which we submit to the FRB for review. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for further information about our annual capital plan. As described in “Available Information” below, summary results of the annual stress test are published on our website.\nAs part of the CCAR process, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions across a range of macroeconomic and company-specific assumptions, based on our and the FRB’s own stress tests.\nThe FRB’s rule applicable to BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including us, replaced the static 2.5% component of the capital conservation buffer required under the Standardized Capital Rules with the SCB. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of a capital plan. See “Available Information” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10‑K for information about our SCB requirement.\nThe SCB rule requires a BHC to receive the FRB’s approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan, which may occur if the BHC determines there has been or will be a “material change” in its risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since the plan was last submitted, or if the FRB directs the BHC to revise and resubmit its capital plan.\nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs, such as GS Bank USA, are required to submit annual company-run stress test results to the FRB. GSBE also has its own capital and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the PRA’s ICAAP guidelines.\nLimitations on the Payment of Dividends.\nU.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus), unless the entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval. As a result of dividend payments from GS Bank USA to Group Inc. in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any dividends without regulatory approval.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\nSource of Strength.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a U.S. subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB’s invoking its source-of-strength authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.\nTransactions Between Affiliates.\nTransactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, including GSBE, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and other credit extensions, including credit exposure arising from resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions, to the extent permitted, to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly, German regulatory requirements provide that certain transactions between GSBE and GS Bank USA or its other affiliates, including Group Inc., must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements. PRA rules provide similar requirements for transactions between GSI and GSIB and their respective affiliates.\nResolution and Recovery Plans.\nWe are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If these regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan or that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, they may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. The FRB and FDIC require U.S. G-SIBs to submit resolution plans every two years (alternating between submissions of full plans and targeted plans that include only select information). We submitted our 2021 resolution plan, which was a targeted submission, in June 2021, and the FRB and FDIC did not identify any deficiencies or shortcomings. Our next required submission is a full submission by July 1, 2023. See “Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory —The application of Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.’s security holders” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and “Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about our resolution plan.\nWe are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. Certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan requirements.\nGS Bank USA is required to provide a resolution plan to the FDIC that must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. GS Bank USA’s most recent resolution plan was submitted in June 2018. In June 2021, the FDIC provided guidance on insured depository institution (IDI) resolution plans and divided IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets, including GS Bank USA, into two groups for purposes of the timing of resolution plan submissions. GS Bank USA is in the second group with a later submission date.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by G-SIBs. The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed G-SIB by limiting the ability of the G-SIB to enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the G‑SIB or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. GS Bank USA has achieved compliance by adhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol) and International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described below.\nCertain of our other subsidiaries also adhere to these protocols. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. The U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol, was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies.\nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by the BRRD II, establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to pre-emptively address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers’ exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts governed by non-E.U. law recognize those temporary stay and bail-in powers unless doing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under the direct authority of the Single Resolution Board for resolution planning. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries of non-E.U. groups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE’s primary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it is also regulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank.\nThe U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, are required to meet the Bank of England’s expectations contained in the U.K. Resolution Assessment Framework, including with respect to loss absorbency, contractual stays, operational continuity and funding in resolution. They are also required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment. The PRA is also the regulatory authority in the U.K. that supervises recovery planning, and GSI and GSIB are each required to submit recovery plans to the PRA.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC).\nThe FRB's rule addresses U.S. implementation of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB’s) TLAC principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for G-SIBs. The rule, among other things, establishes minimum TLAC requirements, establishes minimum requirements for “eligible long-term debt” (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria) and caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt.\nThe rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S. G-SIB from (i) guaranteeing subsidiaries’ liabilities that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt to third parties; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties.\nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent company’s eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured non-contingent third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt.\nThe CRR, the BRRD and U.K. financial services regime are designed to, among other things, implement the FSB’s minimum TLAC requirement for G-SIBs. For example, the CRR requires E.U. subsidiaries of a non-E.U. G-SIB that exceed the threshold of 5% of the G-SIB’s RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSBE, to meet internal TLAC requirements. Under the U.K. financial services regime, GSG UK exceeds the applicable thresholds and therefore, it is subject to internal TLAC requirements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe CRD requires a non-E.U. group with more than €40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) by December 30, 2023 if it has, as in our case, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks. A non-E.U. group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. GSBE and GSPIC will be subject to the single E.U. IHC requirement unless an exemption is granted. The CRR requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements, a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has not implemented a similar requirement to establish an IHC; however, the PRA has introduced a requirement that certain U.K. financial holding companies or a designated U.K. group entity be responsible for the U.K. group’s regulatory compliance. We have designated GSI for that responsibility.\nThe BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject institutions to an MREL, which is generally consistent with the FSB’s TLAC standard. GSI is required to maintain a minimum level of internal MREL and provide the Bank of England the right to exercise bail-in triggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of non-viability and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the bail-in or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings. The Single Resolution Board’s internal MREL requirements applicable to GSBE are required to be phased in through January 2024.\nInsolvency of a BHC or IDI.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime, OLA, for BHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed non-bank subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution’s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects.\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA are generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA, described below.\nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors’ claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a “bridge” entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a “bridge” holding company under its “single point of entry” or “SPOE” strategy pursuant to OLA.\nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power:\n•\nTo transfer any of the IDI’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed “bridge” bank, without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors;\n•\nTo enforce the IDI’s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or\n•\nTo repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the IDI is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the IDI.\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at non-U.S. branches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA\n.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDeposit Insurance.\nDeposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on IDIs. GS Bank USA’s assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. The deposits of GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate in the German voluntary deposit protection program which provides insurance for certain eligible deposits not covered by the German statutory deposit program. Eligible deposits at GSIB and the London branch of GS Bank USA are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the applicable limits.\nIn October 2022, the FDIC adopted a rule applicable to all FDIC-insured banks that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023.\nPrompt Corrective Action.\nThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in “Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC” above.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC’s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC’s general unsecured creditors, as described in “Source of Strength” above.\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities.\nAs a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we may engage.\nVolcker Rule.\nThe Volcker Rule prohibits “proprietary trading,” but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements.\nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, “covered funds” (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund’s net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital.\nThe FRB has granted our request for additional time until July 2023 to conform our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy “illiquid funds” (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about our investments in such funds.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOther Restrictions.\nFHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in non-FHCs (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets.\nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.\nIf any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S.\nU.S. G-SIBs, like us, are also required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions.\nThe New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA’s activities.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for safe-and-sound leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions.\nAs a German credit institution, GSBE will become subject to Volcker Rule-type prohibitions under German banking law and regulations on December 31, 2023 because its financial assets exceeded certain thresholds. Prohibited activities include (i) proprietary trading, (ii) high-frequency trading at a German trading venue, and (iii) lending and guarantee businesses with German hedge funds, German funds of hedge funds or any non-German substantially leveraged alternative investment funds, unless an exclusion or an exemption applies. See “Volcker Rule” above for further information.\nU.K. banks that have over £25 billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities, commonly known as “ring-fencing.” GSIB is not currently subject to the ring-fencing requirement.\nBroker-Dealer and Securities Regulation\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, the use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of clients’ purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws.\nU.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&Co., see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nThe SEC issued a proposed rule in November 2021 which, if adopted, would require lenders of securities to provide the material terms of securities lending transactions to a registered national securities association, such as FINRA.\nThe SEC requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their customers. SEC rules require broker-dealers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. In addition, several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker-dealers.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn December 2022, the SEC issued four proposals to reform the U.S. equity market structure. The SEC proposed establishing a broker-dealer best execution standard, which would require broker-dealers to use reasonable diligence to ascertain the best market for a customer order so that the resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions. The best execution standard applies to all securities and supplements, but does not replace, the existing FINRA and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) best execution rules. The SEC also proposed, among other things, to require that individual investor orders routed through broker-dealers be exposed to order-by-order competition in qualified auctions; to update the minimum pricing increments, with variable price increments based on the trading characteristics of stocks; and to revise and expand reporting and disclosure requirements relating to execution quality.\nIn January 2023, the SEC proposed a rule that would prohibit participants involved in the creation of asset-backed securities, including any underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser or sponsor of an asset-backed security (or any affiliate or subsidiary), from engaging in any transaction that would involve or result in a material conflict of interest between the securitization participant and an investor in an asset-backed security, including reducing its exposure to the asset-backed securities, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe SEC, FINRA and regulators in various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations.\nGS&Co. and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement.\nIn Europe, we provide broker-dealer services, including through GSBE, GSPIC and GSI, that are subject to oversight by European and national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with E.U., U.K. and other national laws and regulations. These laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members.\nIn the E.U. and the U.K., the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) established trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform, enhanced pre- and post-trade transparency covering a wide range of financial instruments, placed volume caps on non-transparent liquidity trading for equities trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer equities crossing networks and created a regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client equity transactions outside a trading venue. Additional control requirements apply to algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits. MiFID II also requires enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, restrictions on the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements, and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services. Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, including GSBE and GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities.\nGSJCL, our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan’s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others.\nThe Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Securities Exchange, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service and the Central Bank of Brazil, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the U.S. regulators.\nOur exchange-based market-making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSwaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation\nThe commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities.\nThe terms “swaps” and “security-based swaps” include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations.\nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all in-scope swaps. A number of these requirements, particularly those regarding recordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a registered swap dealer. GS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and J. Aron, are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. The CFTC has rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB. The CFTC also has financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and capital rules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants that provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization. Certain of our registered swap dealers, including J. Aron, are subject to the CFTC’s capital requirements.\nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our non-bank swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC and FRB margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements.\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. Security-based swaps are defined as swaps on single securities, single loans or narrow-based baskets or indices of securities. The SEC has adopted a number of rules for security-based swap dealers, including (i) capital, margin and segregation requirements; (ii) record-keeping, financial reporting and notification requirements; (iii) business conduct standards; (iv) regulatory and public trade reporting; and (v) the application of risk mitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps. Certain of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., GS Bank USA and GSBE, are registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and subject to the SEC’s regulations regarding security-based swaps. The SEC has proposed additional regulations regarding security-based swaps that would, among other things, require public reporting of large positions in security-based swaps.\nGS Bank USA is also subject to the FRB’s swaps margin rules. These rules require the exchange of initial and variation margin in connection with transactions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared through a registered or exempt clearinghouse. GS Bank USA is required to post and collect margin in connection with transactions with swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants, or financial end users.\nThe CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of swaps and securities-based swaps, and business conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC and the SEC have entered into agreements with certain non-U.S. regulators regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border execution facilities and clearinghouses, and have approved substituted compliance with certain non-U.S. regulations related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to non-U.S. margin rules.\nSimilar types of regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. Under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), for example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities. In addition, under the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, transactions in certain types of derivatives are required to be executed on regulated platforms or exchanges.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe CFTC has adopted rules that limit the size of positions in physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common ownership or control. The CFTC position limits apply to futures on physical commodities and options on such futures, apply to both physically and cash settled positions and to swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options. The position limit rules initially impose limits in the spot month only (i.e., during the delivery period for the physical commodities, which is typically a period of several days). CFTC spot and non-spot month limits will continue to apply to futures on certain legacy agricultural commodities, and it is possible that non-spot month limits will at some point be adopted for futures, options on futures and swaps on other categories of physical commodities.\nJ. Aron is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities, Group Inc. is also an “exempt holding company” under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules.\nIn addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities activities, we are subject to energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as described in “Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory — Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGS&Co. is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and several of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are registered with the CFTC and act as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors. Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer.\nAsset Management and Wealth Management Regulation\nOur asset management and wealth management businesses are subject to extensive oversight by regulators around the world relating to, among other things, the fair treatment of clients, safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our management of client funds.\nThe federal securities laws impose fiduciary duties on investment advisers, including GS&Co., Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and our other U.S. registered investment adviser subsidiaries. Additionally, SEC rules require investment advisers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to advisers.\nCertain of our European subsidiaries, including GSBE in the E.U. and GSAMI in the U.K., are subject to MiFID II and/or related regulations (including the U.K. legislation making such regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of E.U. or U.K.-based investment managers and the ability of investment fund managers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. to access those markets. NNIP B.V. is subject to similar requirements as a management company licensed under the E.U. Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive and the E.U. Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive with additional authorizations for certain activities regulated under MiFID II. Our asset management business in the E.U. and the U.K. significantly depends on our ability to delegate parts of our activities to other affiliates.\nGSAMI is also subject to the prudential regime for U.K. investment firms, the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (IFPR), which governs the prudential requirements for U.K. investment firms prudentially regulated by the FCA.\nConsumer Regulation\nOur U.S. consumer-oriented activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. Our consumer-oriented activities are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws, rules and regulations, which, among other things, impose obligations relating to marketing, origination, servicing and collections activities in our consumer businesses. Many of these laws, rules and regulations also apply to our small business lending activities, which are also subject to supervision and regulation by federal and state regulators. In addition, our U.K. consumer deposit-taking activities are subject to U.K. consumer protection laws and regulations.\nCompensation Practices\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe FSB has released standards for implementation by local regulators that are designed to encourage sound compensation practices at banks and other financial companies. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have also provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule requiring securities exchanges to adopt rules mandating, in the case of a restatement, the recovery or “clawback” of excess incentive-based compensation paid to current or former executive officers and requiring listed issuers to disclose any recovery analysis where recovery is triggered by a restatement.\nThe NYDFS’ guidance emphasizes that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators at banking institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, must be subject to effective risk management, oversight and control.\nIn the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD are designed to meet the FSB’s compensation standards. These provisions limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of all employees at GSBE and of certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U., including those employees identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amended certain aspects of these rules, including, by increasing minimum variable compensation deferral periods. Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB.\nThe E.U. and the U.K. have each also introduced investment firm regimes, including rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations\nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or mandates the promulgation of various regulations applicable to financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities.\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends the BSA, is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury has issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations worldwide relating to anti-money laundering and financial transparency, including the E.U. Anti-Money Laundering Directives. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws and regulations worldwide regarding corrupt and illegal payments, or providing anything of value, for the benefit of government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to the identification of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, monitoring direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, providing information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and sharing information with other financial institutions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the privacy of information regarding clients, employees and others. These include, but are not limited to, the GLB Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CCPA), the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (PIPL), and the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. Among other things, the CCPA imposes compliance obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In addition, several other states and non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing, privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA. Furthermore, the GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted certain of our businesses’ collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for non-compliance. The PIPL limits the legal bases for processing personal information, contains heightened notice and consent requirements for the handling of certain types of personal information and imposes special cross-border data transfer rules under certain circumstances.\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations governing cybersecurity and related risks, and which require regulatory disclosures of certain security incidents. The NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cybersecurity policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer.\nIn January 2023, the E.U. Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) became effective, and will apply from January 2025. DORA requires E.U. financial entities, such as GSBE, to have a comprehensive governance and control framework for the management of information and communications technology (ICT) risk.\nIn addition, in March 2022, the SEC proposed new rules that would require disclosures about material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and updated disclosures about previously disclosed cybersecurity incidents on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below are the name, age, present title, principal occupation and certain biographical information for the executive officers who have been appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, Group Inc.’s Board.\nPhilip R.

These conditions can change suddenly and negatively.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, consumer and investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings.\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: low levels of or declines in economic growth, business activity or investor, business or consumer confidence; concerns over a potential recession; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; high levels of inflation or stagflation; concerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes; limitations on international trade and travel; laws and regulations that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their domestic markets; outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concerns about actual or potential increases in interest rates, inflation and other borrowing costs, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, and limitations on international trade, have, at times, negatively impacted the levels of client activity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has in the past negatively impacted client activity, which can adversely affect many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses.\nChanges, or proposed changes, to U.S. international trade and investment policies, particularly with important trading partners, have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets. Continued or escalating tensions may result in further actions taken by the U.S. or other countries that could disrupt international trade and investment and adversely affect financial markets. Those actions could include, among others, the implementation of sanctions, tariffs or foreign exchange measures, the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or other restrictions on cross-border trade, investment, or transfer of information or technology. Any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients’ businesses.\nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks.\nIn January 2023, the outstanding debt of the U.S. reached its statutory limit and the U.S. Treasury Department commenced taking extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling, the U.S. could default on its obligations, including Treasury securities that play an integral role in financial markets. A default by the U.S. could result in unprecedented market volatility and illiquidity, heightened operational risks relating to the clearance and settlement of transactions, margin and other disputes with clients and counterparties, an adverse impact to investors including money market funds that invest in U.S. Treasuries, downgrades in the U.S. credit rating, further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and a recession in the U.S. or other economies. Even if the U.S. does not default, continued uncertainty relating to the debt ceiling could result in downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, which could adversely affect market conditions, lead to margin disputes, further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and necessitate significant operational changes among market participants, including us. A downgrade of the federal government’s credit rating could also materially and adversely affect the market for repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and lending, and other financings typically collateralized by U.S. Treasury or agency obligations. Further, the fair value, liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by, or other obligations of, agencies of the U.S. government or related to the U.S. government or its agencies, as well as municipal bonds could be similarly adversely affected.\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values, particularly where we have net “long” positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post collateral.\nMany of our businesses have net “long” positions in debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset classes. These include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients’ activities, including our exchange-based market-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as through our currencies, commodities, equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, we invest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of our investing and market-making positions and a portion of our loans are marked-to-market on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings, unless we have effectively “hedged” our exposures to those declines.\nIn certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit products, including leveraged loans, and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the trading markets for certain assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. We may incur losses from time to time as trading markets deteriorate or cease to function, including with respect to loan commitments we have made or securities offerings we have underwritten. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets has in the past negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, our capital, liquidity or leverage ratios, our funding costs and our ability to deploy capital.\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing securities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity.\nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients’ portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients’ portfolios or fund assets, which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties. When the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example of such a situation is a “margin call” in connection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties.\nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in and may in the future, despite credit monitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an improper manner, including in violation of law, or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business.\nOur market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility.\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the results of these activities. Increased volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by Value-at-Risk (VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market-making activities or may cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions can adversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those circumstances, we have been and may in the future be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our RWAs, which increases our capital requirements.\nOur investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market conditions.\nOur investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in significant industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of advisory transactions, which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business. Similarly, in recent years, cross-border initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity. Legislative, regulatory or other changes that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities outside the issuers’ domestic markets, that result in or could result in the delisting or removal of securities from exchanges or indices, have in the past adversely affected and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting and client intermediation businesses. Furthermore, changes, or proposed changes, to international trade and investment policies of the U.S. and other countries could negatively affect market activity levels and our revenues.\nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both.\nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues, principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in products that generate less fee income.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees.\nPoor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses, due to either general market conditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell, affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on AUS or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products, such as structured notes or derivatives. To the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if, due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income products), our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected.\nInflation has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInflationary pressures have affected economies, financial markets and market participants worldwide. Inflationary pressures have increased certain of our operating expenses, and have adversely affected consumer sentiment and CEO confidence. Central bank responses to inflationary pressures have also resulted in higher market interest rates, which, in turn, have contributed to lower activity levels across financial markets, in particular for debt underwriting transactions and mortgage originations, and resulted in lower values for certain financial assets which have adversely affected our equity and debt investments. Higher interest rates increase our borrowing costs and have required us to increase interest paid on our deposits. If inflationary pressures persist, our expenses may increase further; we may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target; activity levels for certain of our businesses, in particular debt underwriting and mortgages, may remain at low levels or decline further; our interest expense could increase faster than our interest income, reducing our net interest income and net interest margin; certain of our investments could continue to incur losses or generally low levels of returns; AUS could decline, reducing management and other fees; economies worldwide could experience recessions; and we could continue to operate in a generally unfavorable economic and market environment.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to raise or retain deposits, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack of timely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as in March 2020, when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception among market participants that we, or other market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.\nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks. The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex, and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our positions.\nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations. For example, in 2021, an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted, resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions. In addition, clearinghouses, exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise set-off rights or the right to require additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our liquidity.\nNumerous regulations have been adopted that impose more stringent liquidity requirements on large financial institutions, including us. These regulations require us to hold large amounts of highly liquid assets and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy funding. In addition, our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or other funding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients’ merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our advisory and underwriting businesses.\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses.\nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding.\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements.\nAs of December 2022, our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $343 million in the event of a one-notch downgrade of our credit ratings and $1.12 billion in the event of a two-notch downgrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency’s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. For further information about our credit ratings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management — Credit Ratings” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to legal, regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to Group Inc.\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc.\nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank entities and their subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on related-party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB’s source of strength requirement, and even require Group Inc. to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, Group Inc.’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.\nThere has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to “ring fence” or require internal total loss-absorbing capacity (which may also be subject to “bail-in” powers, as described below) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities. The result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of stress, thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis.\nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\nThe requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments.\nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about regulatory restrictions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCredit\nOur businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes.\nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress, increased volatility and illiquidity.\nAs part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we finance our clients’ positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we have limits and regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. The number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of concentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities. Disruptions in the credit markets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated, and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate, the trading markets for loans we originate. These disruptions may make it difficult for us to sell or value such assets, which may result in losses for us from time to time.\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certain asset-backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearinghouses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearinghouses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDerivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk, unexpected risks and potential losses.\nWe are party to a large number of derivative transactions, including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk, as well as increased costs to us.\nDerivative transactions also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed, that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty, or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be “netted” against other obligations with such counterparty. In addition, counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized.\nAs a signatory to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA Protocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to the FRB’s and FDIC’s rules on QFCs and similar rules in other jurisdictions, we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and, as this regime has not yet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event. The ISDA Protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts.\nDerivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights.\nIn addition, as new complex derivative products are created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with these transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks, and could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, these provisions have increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms.\nOperational\nA failure in our operational systems or human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards.\nMany rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators, exchanges and investors. Compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging, and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely, accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules. As reporting requirements expand, compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging.\nAs our client base, including through our consumer businesses, and our geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has become more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions has increased, as have the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. These risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility. As with other similarly situated institutions, we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses, including our consumer-oriented activities. Allegations or publicity, whether or not accurate, that our underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly, or comply with the applicable law or regulation, can result in negative publicity, reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny, investigations and enforcement actions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur financial, accounting, data processing or other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. We must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our clients and counterparties or us. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our third-party service providers and vendors. Their importance has continued to increase, in particular in light of work-from-home arrangements. Computers and computer networks are subject to various risks, including, among others, cyber attacks, inherent technological defects, system failures and human error. For example, fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may occur in the future. The use of personal devices by our employees or by our vendors for work-related activities also presents risks related to potential violations of record retention and other requirements. Cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions have resulted, and may result in the future, in delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our platforms. There have been a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud computing providers. Addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems. Operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks.\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and, from time to time, they have in the past and may in the future make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. These have in the past and may in the future include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or simple errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors, malfeasance and other misconduct, including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes, even if promptly discovered and remediated, has in the past resulted and may in the future result in reputational damage and losses and liabilities for us.\nThe majority of the employees in our primary locations, including the New York metropolitan area, London, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Salt Lake City and Dallas, work in close proximity to one another. Our headquarters is located in the New York metropolitan area, and we have our largest employee concentration occupying two principal office buildings near the Hudson River waterfront. They are subject to potential catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, terrorist attacks, extreme weather, or other hostile events that could negatively affect our business. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, business disruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead to our employees’ inability to occupy the offices, communicate with or travel to other office locations or work remotely. As a result, our ability to service and interact with clients may be adversely impacted, due to our failure or inability to successfully implement business contingency plans.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nA failure or disruption in our infrastructure, or in the operational systems or infrastructure of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nWe face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients’ systems.\nThere has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearinghouses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure, delay, termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.\nThe interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Interconnectivity of financial institutions with other companies through, among other things, application programming interfaces or APIs presents similar risks. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nDespite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, transportation or other facilities used by us, our employees or third parties with which we conduct business, including cloud service providers. These disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, economic or political developments, pandemics and weather events.\nIn addition, although we seek to diversify our third-party vendors to increase our resiliency, we are exposed to risks if our vendors operate in the same area and are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us. We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors’ use of common service providers.\nAdditionally, although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrency and similar technologies is growing, the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses. We are exposed to risks, and may become exposed to additional risks, related to distributed ledger technology, including through our facilitation of clients’ activities involving financial products that use distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies or other digital assets, our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology, the use of distributed ledger technology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearinghouses and other financial intermediaries, and the receipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as collateral. The market volatility that financial products using distributed ledger technology have recently experienced may increase these risks.\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients’ information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software and information technology service providers, governmental agencies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized access or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of inadequate procedures or the failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies, and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual consumers. The migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee-owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home arrangements . In addition, due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective service providers), central agents, exchanges, clearinghouses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event or could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, including because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\nAlthough we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact. Risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into, and adversely affect our ability to respond to, cyber threats and issues with our systems.\nIf one or more of these types of events occur, it potentially could jeopardize our, our clients’, our counterparties’ or third parties' confidential and other information processed, stored in, or transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients, counterparties or third parties, which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action, significant losses or reputational damage. In addition, such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being properly detected or escalated, and, following detection or escalation, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. Moreover, potential new regulations may require us to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been resolved or fully investigated.\nWe have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nOur clients’ confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks, as can work-from-home arrangements. Certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nWe may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market-making, investing or lending positions, and underwriting activities, with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, in the course of our activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk.\nThe models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.\nIn addition, the use of models in connection with risk management and numerous other critical activities presents risks that the models may be ineffective, either because of poor design, ineffective testing, or improper or flawed inputs, as well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs.\nTo the extent that we have positions through our market-making or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing activities, including private equity, that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments.\nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, geographic areas or markets, which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities.\nAs we have expanded and intend to continue to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings of credit and investment products to consumers, we are presented with different risks and must expand and adapt our risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities. A failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us.\nFor further information about our risk management policies and procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLegal and Regulatory\nOur businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry and a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by law enforcement, regulatory and taxing authorities, as well as private litigation, in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. In many cases, our activities have been and may continue to be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions. Among other things, as a result of law enforcement authorities, regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations, we or our employees have been, and could be, fined, criminally charged or sanctioned; prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities; subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including higher capital requirements; or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect to our employees. These limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability.\nIn addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities, day-to-day compliance with existing laws and regulations has involved and will continue to involve significant amounts of time, including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance and other reporting and operational personnel, all of which may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions. The laws and regulations that apply to our businesses are often complex and, in many cases, we must make interpretive decisions regarding the application of those laws and regulations to our business activities. Changes in interpretations, whether in response to regulatory guidance, industry conventions, our own reassessments or otherwise, could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or ability to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, such as capital or liquidity requirements.\nIf there are new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients, including capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total loss-absorbing capacity and margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements, requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning, tax burdens and compensation restrictions, that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (whether based on size, method of funding, activities, geography or other criteria), compliance with these new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way. In addition, regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally, such as taxes on stock transfers, share repurchases and other financial transactions, could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly, and thus impact our businesses. Changes to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on us, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to financial services and financial firms or due to our corporate structure or where these services are provided.\nThese developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in those jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations or complying with applicable capital requirements, including reducing dividends or share repurchases, liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulatory developments, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, have significantly altered the regulatory framework within which we operate and have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our profitability. Among the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are: increased capital, liquidity and reporting requirements; limitations on activities in which we may engage; increased regulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets and transactions; limitations on incentive compensation; limitations on affiliate transactions; requirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning; increased deposit insurance assessments; and increased standards of care for broker-dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients. The implementation of higher capital requirements, more stringent requirements relating to liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, covered funds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position, particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions. We may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of Basel Committee standards, including the credit and operational risk capital standards published in December 2017 and the market risk capital standard published in January 2019.\nAs described in “Business — Regulation — Banking Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the SCB has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Capital Rules and resulted in higher Standardized capital ratio requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to, among other things, repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, which can result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could, among other things, prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity. Additionally, as a G‑SIB, we are subject to the G‑SIB surcharge. Our G‑SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year. Expansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short-term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our G‑SIB surcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase.\nFurther, the CRD requires certain non-E.U. groups with more than €40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. IHC by December 30, 2023. A non-E.U. group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. If we are unable to obtain approval to have two E.U. IHCs, we would be required to limit our European subsidiary activities to those that are permissible for GSBE.\nIn addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology.\nWe have entered into consumer-oriented deposit-taking, lending and credit card businesses, and we may expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings. Entering into these businesses subjects us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate. Not only are these regulations extensive, but they involve types of regulations and supervision, as well as regulatory compliance risks, that have not historically applied to us. The level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Complying with these regulations is time-consuming, costly and presents new and increased risks.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur expansion into consumer-oriented activities will result in a change to GS Bank USA's CRA requirements later in 2023, such that GS Bank USA will no longer be assessed as a “wholesale bank” for CRA compliance purposes and, instead, will be assessed pursuant to the framework applicable to large commercial banks or pursuant to an approved strategic plan. Any failure to comply with different or expanded CRA requirements as a result of this change in assessment methods could negatively impact GS Bank USA's CRA ratings, cause reputational harm and result in limits on our ability to make future acquisitions or engage in certain new activities.\nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client. Regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a “control person” for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment, but which they do not actively manage. In addition, regulators and courts continue to seek to establish “fiduciary” obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been assumed to exist. To the extent that such efforts are successful, the cost of, and liabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage, clearing, market-making, prime brokerage, investing and other similar activities could increase significantly. To the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual, institutional, sovereign or investment fund clients, any breach, or even an alleged breach, of such obligations could have materially negative legal, regulatory and reputational consequences.\nFor information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject, see “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nA failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\nDue to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.\nIn addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions between us and covered funds.\nWe have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Additionally, our One Goldman Sachs initiative aims to increase collaboration among our businesses, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. The realignment of our businesses, reflected in our new segments beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, presents similar risks.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other matters remains at high levels. Political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past resulted and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials. Press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us) often result in some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits.\nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. Governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other actions, including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having previously engaged in criminal, regulatory or other misconduct. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Further, we are subject to regulatory settlements, orders and feedback that require significant remediation activities, which require us to commit significant resources, including hiring, as well as testing the operation and effectiveness of new controls, policies and procedures.\nThe financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity. Our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations. Postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money, securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity.\nSubstantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations. We have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment-related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount. Additionally, governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings, and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities, as well as follow-on civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements.\nSignificant settlements by several large financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, with governmental entities have been publicly announced. The trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, in similar actions, especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties.\nClaims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have become more common. Financial institutions (including us) have been subject to civil cases and investigatory demands relating to alleged bid-rigging, group boycotts or other anti-competitive practices. Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages. These claims have resulted in significant settlements and fines in the past and may do so in the future.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties. Such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCertain law enforcement authorities have recently required admissions of wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal pleas, as part of the resolutions of matters brought against financial institutions or their employees. See for example, “1MDB-Related Matters” in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. Further, as a result of this type of settlement, we are no longer a “well-known seasoned issuer,” which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities.\nIn conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, legal, regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.\nIn conducting our businesses and supporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, communications and other content restrictions, and other restrictive governmental actions. For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia and Venezuela. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. We have been in some cases subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across markets, and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation generally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure, or alleged failure, to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions and other sanctions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.\nWhile business and other practices throughout the world differ, our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the FCPA, the BSA and the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our operations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation. See for example, “1MDB-Related Matters” in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct. This misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information, including proprietary software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases, as reflected by the settlements relating to 1MDB.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for Group Inc.’s security holders.\nAs described in “Business — Regulation — Banking Supervision and Regulation — Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC,” if the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, the rights of Group Inc.’s creditors would be determined under OLA, and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders.\nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under OLA to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on shareholders, debtholders and other creditors of the top-tier BHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the BHC’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. It is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc.’s security holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries.\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and that support from Group Inc. or other available resources to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc.’s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.’s security holders (including our shareholders, debtholders and other unsecured creditors) could face significant and possibly complete losses. In that case, Group Inc.’s security holders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.’s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the priority of creditor claims.\nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors, including senior creditors.\nIn addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including debtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which Group Inc.’s assets are transferred. If such a securities-for-claims exchange were implemented, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged. While the FDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the E.U., have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Such “bail-in” powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank of England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such “bail-in” powers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is “bailed in,” Group Inc.’s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries’ third-party creditors or written down. U.S. regulators are considering and non-U.S. authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the top-tier BHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the top-tier BHC in the event of failure.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe application of Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.’s security holders.\nIn our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.’s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses.\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc. transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its GCLA to Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.\nWe also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under the CLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc. with a committed line of credit that allows Group Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.’s and Funding IHC’s obligations under the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.’s liquidity. As a result, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented.\nIf Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy were successful, Group Inc.’s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. As part of the strategy, Group Inc. could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries’ derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which would result in holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.’s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries.\nIf Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc.’s financial condition would be adversely impacted and Group Inc.’s security holders, including debtholders, may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk.\nAs a result of our recovery and resolution planning processes, including incorporating feedback from our regulators, we may incur increased operational, funding or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient.\nOur commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs.\nAs part of our commodities business, we purchase and sell certain physical commodities, arrange for their storage and transport, and engage in market making of commodities. The commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil, refined oil products, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and precious), minerals (including unenriched uranium), emission credits, coal, freight and related products and indices.\nWe make investments in and finance entities that engage in the production, storage and transportation of numerous commodities, including many of the commodities referenced above.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThese activities subject us and/or the entities in which we invest to extensive and evolving federal, state and local energy, environmental, antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste management, transportation of hazardous substances, natural resources, site remediation and health and safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation that could increase the operating costs and adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments.\nThere may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related activities and investments. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring, renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses.\nCommodities involved in our intermediation activities and investments are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events, which are likely to be outside of our control, including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessels, storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of hazardous substances, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities, could expose us to costs or losses. Also, while we seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses.\nThe occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our operations or financial results and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm.\nWe may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons or due to the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy in response to climate change.\nCompetition\nOur results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base.\nOur client base is not the same as that of our major competitors. Our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets. For example, our market-making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past been and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility.\nCorrespondingly, favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market. For example, we have a smaller corporate client base in our market-making businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients. Similarly, we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions, which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive.\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. This has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. As we have expanded into new business areas and new geographic regions, we have faced competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand our businesses.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGovernments and regulators have adopted regulations, imposed taxes, adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or other similar rules, many of which do not apply to all our U.S. or non-U.S. competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively.\nPricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and other assignments, in response to competitive pressure we have experienced, we have extended and priced credit at levels that in some cases have not fully compensated us for the risks we undertook.\nThe financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry. Many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions, and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions. This has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices, including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated. While we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities, they may not be effective. Allegations of such activities, particularly by regulators, can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements, and potentially significant penalties, including treble damages.\nThe growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading and distributed ledger technologies, including cryptocurrencies, has increased competition.\nTechnology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-based market-making activities, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure.\nWe have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return, particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades.\nIn addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies, including distributed ledgers, such as digital assets and blockchain, have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services, and we expect to continue to make such investments, which could be material. The adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs. Further, technologies, such as those based on distributed ledgers, that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services. Regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving digital assets and distributed ledger technologies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors. We may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating, or even able to develop or integrate, new products and technologies, such as those built on distributed ledgers, into our existing products and services, adapting to changes in consumer preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients, cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us.\nOur businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits, and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees. As a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of year-end discretionary compensation, a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity-related awards, declines in our profitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability, as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCompetition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry, including the technology industry, for qualified employees has often been intense. We have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of our expanding consumer-oriented businesses and our technology initiatives. This is also the case in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region.\nLaws or regulations in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees’ income or the amount or composition of compensation, or that require us to disclose our or our competitors’ compensation practices, may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions.\nAs described further in “Business — Regulation —Compensation Practices” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a large global financial and banking institution, we are subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA, the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. These limitations have shaped our compensation practices, which has, in some cases, adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees, in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations, and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects.\nOur operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part, on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations. Our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain, and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate.\nMarket Developments and General Business Environment\nOur businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, such as COVID-19, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme weather events, solar events or other natural disasters, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These events could have such effects through economic or financial market disruptions or challenging economic or market conditions more generally, the deterioration of our creditworthiness or that of our counterparties, changes in consumer sentiment and consumer borrowing, spending and savings patterns, liquidity stress, or operational difficulties (such as travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices) that impair our ability to manage our businesses.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on, among other things, future developments, including any resurgence of COVID-19 cases, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments over the long term and against new variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nClimate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties, and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation.\nClimate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients, adversely affect the value of our investments, including our real estate investments, and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Climate change and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties, which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public policy, laws and regulations, or market and public perceptions and preferences in connection with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. These changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. For example, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our or our clients’ involvement in, or decision not to participate in, certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. If we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective, insufficient or otherwise inappropriate, our business, reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer.\nNew regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of government officials, regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products. Federal and state, and non-U.S. banking regulators and supervisory authorities, shareholders and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address risks related to climate change, both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending, investment and advisory activities. The FRB has announced that we are among the six U.S. financial institutions participating in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise in 2023, and we also are subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. The risks associated with, and the perspective of regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding, climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change-related risks and uncertainties, and we expect that climate change-related risks will increase over time.\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions and other developments.\nThe war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively affected the global economy. Governments around the world have responded to Russia’s invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on certain industry sectors, including price caps on Russian oil, and parties in Russia. Compliance with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has increased our costs and otherwise adversely affected our business and may continue to do so. Russia has responded with its own restrictions against investors and countries outside Russia and has proposed additional measures aimed at non-Russia owned businesses. Businesses in the U.S. and globally have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine or other hostilities could result in, among other things, further increased risk of cyber attacks, an increased frequency and volume of failures to settle securities transactions, supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets.\nThe extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, and the consequences for our business could be significant. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Credit Risk Management — Selected Exposures — Country Exposures” for further information about our credit exposure to Russia and Ukraine.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCertain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular USD LIBOR.\nOn January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings as representative rates will cease after June 2023. The FCA proposed that certain of those USD LIBOR settings continue to be published on a synthetic basis through September 2024. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP LIBOR settings in legacy GBP LIBOR-based derivative contracts through March 2024.\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA has confirmed that the FCA’s formal announcement to cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-USD LIBOR settings following December 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for USD LIBOR settings following June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (LIBOR Act), that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. In December 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when USD LIBOR ceases to be published on June 30, 2023. As the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs.\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. Once a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. Although the LIBOR Act includes safe harbors if the FRB-identified SOFR-based replacement rate is selected, these safe harbors are untested. As a result, and despite the enactment of the LIBOR Act, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings, the selection of a successor rate could result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financial instruments. Discretionary actions taken in connection with the implementation of fallback provisions could also result in client disputes and litigation particularly for derivatives and other synthetic instruments.\nChanges in, the discontinuation of, or changes in market acceptance of any IBOR, particularly USD LIBOR, as a reference rate may adversely affect certain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products.\nCertain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in other reference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked.\nMany of the products that we own or that we offer, such as structured notes, warrants, swaps or security-based swaps, pay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by reference to an index, currency, basket, ETF or other financial metric (the underlier). In the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed, by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that a country withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, an index or ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or ETF, or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or ETF), the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on linking a financial instrument to the underlier, we may experience adverse effects.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.\nContinued or escalating tensions between the U.S. and China have resulted in and may result in additional changes to U.S. international trade and investment policies, which could disrupt international trade and investment, adversely affect financial markets, including market activity levels, and adversely impact our revenues. Continued or escalating tensions may also lead to the U.S., China or other countries taking other actions, which could include the implementation of sanctions, tariffs or foreign exchange measures, the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury securities or restrictions on cross-border trade, investment or transfer of information or technology. Any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients’ businesses, as well as our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially.\nA conflict, or concerns about a potential conflict, involving China and Taiwan, the U.S. or other countries could negatively impact financial markets and our or our clients’ businesses. Trade restrictions by the U.S. or other countries in response to a conflict or potential conflict involving China, including financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain organizations or individuals, or actions taken by China in response to trade restrictions, could negatively impact our or our clients’ ability to conduct business in certain countries or with certain counterparties and could negatively impact regional and global financial markets and economic conditions. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, possibly materially.\nWe face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities, operate in new locations, transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and new markets.\nA number of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses, including through acquisitions and partnership arrangements, could continue to bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new markets, and present us with integration challenges. For example, we continue to transact business and invest in new regions, including a wide range of emerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally.\nFurthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we make markets, invest and lend, we own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports, toll roads and shipping ports, as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components, both within and outside the U.S.\nWe have increased our consumer-oriented deposit-taking and lending activities. For example, we now issue credit cards to consumers and through our acquisition of GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky), we expanded our offering of point-of-sale financing. To the extent we engage in those and other consumer-oriented activities, we have faced, and would continue to face, additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to, among other things, higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information. Acquisitions and new products can also expose us to new or different types of risks. For example, providing point-of-sale financing through GreenSky also subjects us to risks relating to retaining and attracting merchants and servicing loans for other banks, as well as potential liability for remediation costs if merchants fail to fulfill their obligations to consumers. We are also subject to additional legal requirements, including with respect to suitability and consumer protection (for example, Regulation Best Interest, fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations). Further, identity fraud may increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions, such as us, to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe have increased and intend to further increase our transaction banking activities. As a result, we expect to face additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, including with respect to know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of property belonging to countries, entities and individuals subject to sanctions by U.S. or other governmental authorities.\nNew business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks associated with dealing with governmental entities, reputational concerns arising from dealing with different types of clients, business partners, counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, market, sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in which certain assets are being operated or held or in which we interact with these clients, business partners, counterparties and investors. Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also exist in connection with activities and transactions involving new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or conflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions.\nWe have developed and pursued new business and strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, and expect to continue to do so. If and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, and face other adverse consequences, such as negative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing those initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, such as generating additional revenues, achieving expense savings, reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently. Engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks, including that we may be unable to successfully develop new, competitive, efficient and effective systems and processes, and hire and retain the necessary personnel. Due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending, our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offerings for the business.\nIn recent years, we have invested, and may continue to invest, more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues. In order to develop and be able to offer consumer financial products that compete effectively, we have made and may continue to make significant investments in technology and human capital resources in connection with our consumer-oriented activities. Such investments and acquisitions may not be successful or have returns similar to our other businesses.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect, or at all.\nWe have engaged in selective acquisitions and may continue to do so in the future and these acquisitions may, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. Any future acquisitions could involve the issuance of common stock and/or the payment of cash as consideration. The success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities. We may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, counterparties, regulators and others in connection with acquisitions. Integration of acquired businesses is time-consuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses, produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties, cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial, management and other resources. It is also possible that an acquisition, once announced, may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing conditions, such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals.\nThere is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected benefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect, or at all. If we are not able to integrate our acquisitions successfully, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThere is no assurance that the reorganization of our business segments will yield all of the expected benefits in the time frames that we expect, or at all.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $30.06 for 2022, compared with $59.45 for 2021. Return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 10.2% for 2022, compared with 23.0% for 2021. Book value per common share was $303.55 as of December 2022, 6.7% higher compared with December 2021.\nNet revenues were $47.37 billion for 2022, 20% lower than a strong 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management and lower net revenues in Global Banking & Markets, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Platform Solutions. Net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments. Net revenues in Global Banking & Markets primarily reflected significantly lower Investment banking fees compared with a strong prior year, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC). Net revenues in Platform Solutions were significantly higher, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms.\nProvision for credit losses was $2.72 billion for 2022, compared with $357 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. Provisions for 2021 reflected growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses were $31.16 billion for 2022, 2% lower than 2021, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). This decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of NN Investment Partners (NNIP) and GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky) and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 65.8% for 2022, compared with 53.8% for 2021.\nDuring 2022, we returned a total of $6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.50 billion and common stock dividends of $3.20 billion. As of December 2022, our CET1 capital ratio was 15.1% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.4% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nBusiness Environment\nIn 2022, the global economy was impacted by persistent broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war, and inflationary and labor market pressures. Governments around the world responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by imposing economic sanctions, and global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year. These factors contributed to increased market volatility during the year, as well as a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021.\nThe economic outlook remains uncertain, reflecting concerns about the continuation or escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine and other geopolitical risks, inflation, and supply chain complications. See “Results of Operations — Segment Assets and Operating Results — Segment Operating Results” for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFair Value\nFair Value Hierarchy.\nTrading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.\nThe fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.\nInstruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.8% as of December 2022 and 1.6% as of December 2021 of our total assets. See Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:\n•\nDetermining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;\n•\nDetermining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and\n•\nDetermining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.\nRegardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.\nControls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments.\nMarket makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nPrice Verification.\nAll financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include:\n•\nTrade Comparison.\nAnalysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.\n•\nExternal Price Comparison.\nValuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, S&P Global Services, Bloomberg, ICE Data Services, Pricing Direct, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.\n•\nCalibration to Market Comparables.\nMarket-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.\n•\nRelative Value Analyses.\nMarket-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.\n•\nCollateral Analyses.\nMargin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations.\n•\nExecution of Trades.\nWhere appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels.\n•\nBacktesting.\nValuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales.\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.\nReview of Net Revenues.\nIndependent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.\nReview of Valuation Models.\nOur independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See “Risk Management — Model Risk Management” for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk.\nOur estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us.\nTo estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of December 2022 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in 2023 and a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $1.0 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of December 2022. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.\nUse of Estimates\nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. The estimated fair value of our Consumer platforms reporting unit, which represents approximately 7.5% of our goodwill, was not substantially in excess of its carrying value. This reporting unit has been adversely impacted by the recent operating environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concerns. We will continue to closely monitor it to determine whether an impairment is required in the future. As of December 2022, the goodwill related to the Consumer platforms reporting unit was $482 million. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our reporting units or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nWe also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. As of December 2022, our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.22 billion. We use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. As of December 2022, we had $8.93 billion of deferred tax assets with a related valuation allowance of $1.57 billion. Our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about Recent Accounting Developments.\nResults of Operations\nThe composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.\nFinancial Overview\nThe table below presents an overview of our financial results and selected financial ratios.\nIn the table above:\n•\nNet earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends.\n•\nROE is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly common shareholders’ equity. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.\n•\nReturn on average tangible common shareholders' equity (ROTE) is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly tangible common shareholders’ equity. We believe that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders’ equity and ROTE are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents our average equity and the reconciliation of average common shareholders’ equity to average tangible common shareholders’ equity.\n•\nNet earnings to average assets is calculated by dividing net earnings by average total assets.\n•\nReturn on shareholders’ equity is calculated by dividing net earnings by average monthly shareholders’ equity.\n•\nAverage equity to average assets is calculated by dividing average total shareholders’ equity by average total assets.\n•\nDividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by diluted EPS.\nNet Revenues\nThe table below presents our net revenues by line item.\nIn the table above:\n•\nInvestment banking consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from financial advisory and underwriting assignments. These activities are included in Global Banking & Markets.\n•\nInvestment management consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from providing asset management and wealth advisory services across all major asset classes to a diverse set of clients. These activities are included in Asset & Wealth Management.\n•\nCommissions and fees consists of revenues from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Substantially all of these activities are included in Global Banking & Markets.\n•\nMarket making consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from client execution activities related to making markets in interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies, commodities and equity products. These activities are included in Global Banking & Markets.\n•\nOther principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from our equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in Asset & Wealth Management), and debt investing and lending activities (included across our three segments).\nOperating Environment.\nDuring 2022, the operating environment was characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in global equity and bond prices and wider corporate credit spreads compared with the end of 2021. These factors contributed to solid market-making activity levels and a decline in industry-wide investment banking activity, particularly for underwriting. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021.\nIf concerns about the economic outlook grow, including those about the continuation or escalation of geopolitical concerns, inflation and supply chain complications, and the persistence of COVID-19-related effects, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or a decline in market-making activity levels, or a continued decline in investment banking activity levels, and net revenues and provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See “Segment Assets and Operating Results — Segment Operating Results” for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\n2022 versus 2021\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $47.37 billion for 2022, 20% lower than a strong 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower\nother principal transactions revenues and\ninvestment banking revenues, partially offset by significantly higher market making revenues.\nNon-Interest Revenues.\nInvestment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.36 billion for 2022, 48% lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower revenues in advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.01 billion for 2022, 10% higher than 2021, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and a reduction in fee waivers on money market funds.\nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $4.03 billion for 2022, 12% higher than 2021, primarily due to higher commissions and fees in Equities, reflecting generally higher volumes.\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $18.63 billion for 2022, 21% higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by lower revenues in equity products.\nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $654 million for 2022, compared with $11.62 billion for 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities and net mark-downs in debt investments compared with net mark-ups in 2021.\nNet Interest Income.\nNet interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $7.68 billion for 2022, 19% higher than 2021, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and loans, reflecting the impact of higher average balances and higher average interest rates. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, and borrowings, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and deposits, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates and higher average balances. See “Statistical Disclosures – Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity” for further information about our sources of net interest income.\n2021 versus 2020\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $59.34 billion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, investment banking revenues and net interest income, and higher investment management revenues.\nNon-Interest Revenues.\nInvestment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $14.14 billion for 2021, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher revenues in advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity.\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.17 billion for 2021, 17% higher than 2020, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. In addition, incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting.\nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.59 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020.\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.36 billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020, as significantly lower revenues in interest rate products and credit products were largely offset by significantly higher revenues in equity products (primarily in derivatives) and commodities, and improved results in mortgages.\nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.62 billion for 2021, compared with $4.76 billion for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities and in debt instruments, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in 2020.\nNet Interest Income.\nNet interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $6.47 billion for 2021, 36% higher than 2020, reflecting a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and long-term borrowings, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements and trading assets, both reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for loans. See “Supplemental Financial Information — Statistical Disclosures — Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity” for further information about our sources of net interest income.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nProvision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses.\nThe table below presents our provision for credit losses.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n2022 versus 2021.\nProvision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.72 billion for 2022, compared with $357 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and net charge-offs. Provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth in the credit card and wholesale portfolios, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broader economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2021 versus 2020.\nProvision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $357 million for 2021, compared with $3.10 billion for 2020. Provisions for 2021 reflected portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including approximately $185 million of provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment.\nThe table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.\n2022 versus 2021.\nOperating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $31.16 billion for 2022, 2% lower than 2021. Our efficiency ratio was 65.8% for 2022, compared with our medium-term target efficiency ratio of approximately 60%. Our efficiency ratio was 53.8% for 2021.\nThe decrease in operating expenses compared with 2021 was primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). This decrease was partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and GreenSky and increases in transaction based expenses and technology expenses. While certain expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, occupancy and market development) were impacted by inflationary pressures, the overall impact of higher inflation was not material to our operating expenses for 2022.\nNet provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $576 million for 2022 compared with $534 million for 2021.\nHeadcount increased 10% during 2022, primarily reflecting investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions of NNIP and GreenSky.\n2021 versus 2020.\nOperating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $31.94 billion for 2021, 10% higher than 2020. Our efficiency ratio was 53.8% for 2021, compared with 65.0% for 2020. In 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points.\nThe increase in operating expenses compared with 2020 primarily reflected significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments).\nNet provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $534 million for 2021 compared with $3.42 billion for 2020.\nCharitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives were approximately $250 million for 2021.\nHeadcount increased 8% during 2021, reflecting investments in growth initiatives and an increase in technology professionals.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nProvision for Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for 2022 was 16.5%, down from the full year income tax rate of 20.0% for 2021, primarily due to an increase in the impact of permanent tax benefits, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of earnings in 2022 compared with 2021.\nThe U.K. Finance Act 2021 increased the corporate income tax rate by six percent and the Finance Act 2022 decreased the U.K. bank surcharge tax rate by five percent effective from April 1, 2023. As a result, beginning April 1, 2023, the U.K. tax rate for our U.K. regulated broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries and branches, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB), will increase by one percent and the U.K. tax rate for all other U.K. subsidiaries and branches will increase by six percent. During 2022, following Royal Assent of Finance Act 2022, certain U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured and a net reduction in deferred tax assets of approximately $50 million was recognized.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes income tax incentives to encourage investments in clean energy and a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). The CAMT applies to corporations with average annual profits over $1 billion and is calculated on their financial statement income, with certain adjustments, for years beginning after December 31, 2022. The legislation had no impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate and based on our current understanding of the CAMT, is not expected to have a material impact on our 2023 annual effective tax rate.\nSegment Assets and Operating Results\nSegment Assets.\nThe table below presents assets by segment.\nThe allocation process for segment assets is based on the activities of these segments. The allocation of assets includes allocation of GCLA (which consists of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash), which is generally included within cash and cash equivalents, collateralized agreements and trading assets on our balance sheet. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets. See “Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management” for further information about our GCLA.\nSegment Operating Results.\nThe table below presents our segment operating results.\nNet revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments.\nThe allocation of common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s pre-tax earnings.\nCompensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry sectors, financial measures and individual company stocks. Our exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and ETFs, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide. In addition, we generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions.\n•\nEquities financing.\nIncludes prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients’ short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral and provide securities-based loans to individuals. In addition, we execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nMarket-Making Activities\nAs a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.\nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.\nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions.\nOther.\nWe lend to corporate clients, including through relationship lending and acquisition financing. The hedges related to this lending and financing activity are also reported as part of Other. Other also includes equity and debt investing activities related to our Global Banking & Markets activities.\nThe table below presents our Global Banking & Markets assets.\nThe table below presents details about our Global Banking & Markets loans.\nOur average Global Banking & Markets gross loans were $105.11 billion for 2022 and $74.34 billion for 2021.\nThe table below presents our Global Banking & Markets operating results.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents our FICC and Equities net revenues by line item in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nIn the table above:\n•\nSee “Net Revenues” for information about market making revenues, commissions and fees, other principal transactions revenues and net interest income. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for net interest income by segment.\n•\nThe primary driver of net revenues for FICC intermediation for all periods was client activity.\nThe table below presents our unaudited quarterly Global Banking & Markets operating results.\nThe table below presents our financial advisory and underwriting transaction volumes.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIn the table above:\n•\nVolumes are per Dealogic.\n•\nAnnounced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction.\n•\nEquity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings.\n•\nDebt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. It also includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues and excludes leveraged loans.\nOperating Environment.\nDuring 2022, Global Banking & Markets operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which negatively affected industry-wide investment banking activity levels, particularly for underwriting, but contributed to solid market-making activity levels.\nIn investment banking, compared with 2021, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes were low amid volatile equity markets and a decline in prices, and industry-wide debt underwriting volumes declined across leveraged finance and investment grade issuances amid rising interest rates. Additionally, industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions declined from elevated levels in the prior year.\nFor volatility, the average daily VIX was 30% higher compared with 2021. In equities, the S&P 500 Index decreased by 19% and the MSCI World Index decreased by 20%, compared with the end of 2021. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year.\nIn the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, and activity levels or volatility decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten, net revenues in Global Banking & Markets would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, if economic conditions deteriorate further or if the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted.\n2022 versus 2021.\nNet revenues in Global Banking & Markets were $32.49 billion for 2022, 12% lower than a strong 2021.\nInvestment banking fees were $7.36 billion, 48% lower than a strong 2021, due to significantly lower net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes, and lower net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year.\nAs of December 2022, our Investment banking fees backlog decreased significantly compared with the end of 2021, primarily due to significantly lower estimated net revenues from both potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (primarily from leveraged finance transactions).\nOur backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.\nNet revenues in FICC were $14.68 billion, 38% higher than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, driven by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and lower net revenues in credit products. In addition, net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, primarily driven by secured lending.\nThe increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity as we supported clients amid an evolving macroeconomic environment. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2021 results:\n•\nNet revenues in interest rate products, currencies and commodities primarily reflected higher client activity.\n•\nNet revenues in mortgages and credit products primarily reflected the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nNet revenues in Equities were $10.99 billion, 6% lower than 2021, due to lower net revenues in Equities intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products and lower net revenues in derivatives. Net revenues in Equities financing were higher, primarily reflecting increased client activity.\nNet revenues in Other were $(537) million for 2022, compared with $265 million for 2021, reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in equities and net mark-downs on acquisition financing activities.\nProvision for credit losses was $468 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of $171 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by growth in the portfolio.\nOperating expenses were $17.85 billion for 2022, 9% lower than 2021, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year). Pre-tax earnings were $14.17 billion for 2022, 18% lower than 2021.\n2021 versus 2020.\nNet revenues in Global Banking & Markets were $36.73 billion for 2021, 21% higher than 2020.\nInvestment banking fees were $14.14 billion, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in Equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in Debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity.\nAs of December 2021, our Investment banking fees backlog increased significantly compared with December 2020, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (particularly from leveraged finance transactions), and higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions.\nNet revenues in FICC were $10.61 billion, 7% lower than 2020, due to lower net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products and credit products and slightly lower net revenues in currencies, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in mortgages and higher net revenues in commodities. Net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from secured lending, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues from resale agreements.\nThe decrease in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected strong but significantly lower client activity compared with very strong activity levels in the prior year due to high volatility amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory compared with challenging conditions in the prior year. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2020 results:\n•\nNet revenues in interest rate products primarily reflected lower client activity.\n•\nNet revenues in credit products and currencies reflected lower client activity, partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.\n•\nNet revenues in mortgages reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.\n•\nNet revenues in commodities primarily reflected higher client activity.\nNet revenues in Equities were $11.72 billion, 19% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities financing, primarily reflecting increased activity (including higher average client balances), and higher net revenues in Equities intermediation, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in derivatives.\nNet revenues in Other were $265 million for 2021, compared with $32 million for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in equities.\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit of $171 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.22 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by portfolio growth.\nOperating expenses were $19.54 billion for 2021, 3% higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance) and higher transaction based expenses, largely offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Pre-tax earnings were $17.36 billion, 67% higher than 2020. ROE was 22.5% for 2021, compared with 13.6% for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 5.4 percentage points).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The majority of revenues in management and other fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets that we manage. For further information about assets under supervision, see “Assets Under Supervision” below. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, client channel and the types of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions.\n•\nIncentive fees.\nIn certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets.

Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year.\nIn the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or withdrawing their assets or deposits, and net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management would likely continue to be negatively impacted.\n2022 versus 2021.\nNet revenues in Asset & Wealth Management were $13.38 billion for 2022, 39% lower than 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments.\nBroad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns during the year led to a decline in global equity prices and wider credit spreads. As a result, net revenues in Equity investments reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities. The decrease in Debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-downs compared with net mark-ups in the prior year and lower net interest income. Incentive fees were significantly lower, primarily driven by harvesting in the prior year. Management and other fees were higher, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP and a reduction in fee waivers on money market funds. Private banking and lending net revenues were significantly higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit spreads, as well as higher loan and deposit balances.\nProvision for credit losses was $519 million for 2022, compared with a net benefit of $169 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit for 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses were $11.55 billion for 2022, essentially unchanged compared with 2021, reflecting the inclusion of operating expenses related to NNIP, largely offset by lower compensation and benefits expenses. Pre-tax earnings were $1.31 billion for 2022, compared with $10.73 billion for 2021.\n2021 versus 2020.\nNet revenues in Asset & Wealth Management were $21.97 billion for 2021, 60% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Debt investments, and higher Management and other fees.\nThe increase in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities, driven by company-specific events and improved corporate performance compared with 2020, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in the prior year. The increase in Debt investments net revenues reflected net mark-ups compared with net mark-downs in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income. The increase in management and other fees reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. Private banking and lending net revenues were higher, primarily reflecting higher deposit balances. Incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting.\nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit of $169 million for 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.40 billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOperating expenses were $11.41 billion for 2021, 20% higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). Pre-tax earnings were $10.73 billion for 2021, compared with $2.89 billion for 2020.\nAssets Under Supervision.\nAUS includes our institutional clients’ assets, assets sourced through third-party distributors and high-net-worth clients’ assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. AUS also includes client assets invested with third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. AUS does not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients.\nThe table below presents information about our firmwide period-end AUS by asset class, client channel, region and vehicle.\nIn the table above:\n•\nLiquidity products includes money market funds and private bank deposits.\n•\nEMEA represents Europe, Middle East and Africa.\nThe table below presents changes in our AUS.\nIn the table above, acquisitions for 2022 included inflows from the acquisitions of NNIP and NextCapital Group, Inc., and from the acquisition of the assets of Bombardier Global Pension Asset Management Inc. For each, substantially all of the inflows were in fixed income and equity assets.\nThe table below presents information about our average monthly firmwide AUS by asset class.\nIn addition to our AUS, we have discretion over alternative investments where we currently do not earn management fees (non-fee-earning alternative assets).\nWe earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were\n$3.33 billion\nas of December 2022, $3.39 billion as of December 2021 and $1.79 billion as of December 2020. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds’ financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets.\nOur target is to achieve annual firmwide management and other fees of more than $10 billion (including more than $2 billion from alternatives) in 2024.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n•\nNon-fee-earning alternative investments primarily includes our direct investing strategies, including private equity, growth equity, private credit and real estate strategies.\nWe have announced a strategic objective of growing our third-party alternatives business, and have established a target of achieving gross inflows of $225 billion for alternative investments from 2020 through the end of 2024.\nThe table below presents information about third-party commitments raised in our alternatives business from 2020 through 2022.\nIn the table above, commitments included in non-fee-earning alternative investments included approximately $44 billion, which will begin to earn fees (and become AUS) if and when the commitments are drawn and assets are invested.\nThe table below presents information about alternative investments in Asset & Wealth Management that we hold on our balance sheet.\nAs we continue to grow our third-party alternatives business, we remain focused on our strategic objective to reduce the capital intensity of our alternative investments in Asset & Wealth Management that we hold on our balance sheet. During 2022, we reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion to $59 billion.\nLoans and Debt Securities.\nThe table below presents the concentration of loans and debt securities within our alternative investments by accounting classification, region and industry.\nEquity Securities.\nThe table below presents the concentration of equity securities within our alternative investments by region and industry.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIn the table above:\n•\nEquity securities included $13 billion as of December 2022 and $14 billion as of December 2021 of private equity positions, and $2 billion as of December 2022 and $4 billion as of December 2021 of public equity positions that converted from private equity upon the initial public offerings of the underlying companies.\n•\nThe concentrations for real estate equity securities as of December 2022 were 9% for multifamily (5% as of December 2021), 5% for office (5% as of December 2021), 8% for mixed use (7% as of December 2021) and 8% for other real estate equity securities (6% as of December 2021).\nThe table below presents the concentration of equity securities within our alternative investments by vintage.\nCIE Investments and Other.\nCIE investments and other included assets held by CIEs of $12 billion as of December 2022 and $14 billion as of December 2021, which were funded with liabilities of approximately $6 billion as of December 2022 and $7 billion as of December 2021. Substantially all such liabilities were nonrecourse, thereby reducing our equity at risk.\nThe table below presents the concentration of CIE assets, net of financings, within our alternative investments by region and asset class.\nThe table below presents the concentration of CIE assets, net of financings, within our alternative investments by vintage.\nPlatform Solutions\nPlatform Solutions includes our consumer platforms, such as partnerships offering credit cards and point-of-sale financing, and transaction banking and other platform businesses.\nPlatform Solutions generates revenues from the following:\nConsumer platforms.\nOur Consumer platforms business issues credit cards and provides point-of-sale financing to consumers to finance the purchases of goods or services. Consumer platforms revenues primarily includes net interest income earned on credit card lending and point-of-sale financing activities.\nTransaction banking and other.\nWe provide transaction banking and other services, including cash management services, such as deposit-taking and payment solutions for corporate and institutional clients. Transaction banking revenues include net interest income attributed to transaction banking deposits.\nThe table below presents our Platform Solutions assets.\nThe table below presents details about our Platform Solutions loans.\nThe average Platform Solutions gross loans were $12.43 billion for 2022 and $5.51 billion for 2021.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents our Platform Solutions operating results.\nThe table below presents our unaudited quarterly Platform Solutions operating results.\nOperating Environment.\nDuring 2022, Platform Solutions operated in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concerns. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with 2021. Additionally, global central banks sought to address inflation by increasing policy interest rates several times over the course of the year.\nIn the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a decrease in consumer spending or a deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and provision for credit losses in Platform Solutions would likely be negatively impacted.\n2022 versus 2021.\nNet revenues in Platform Solutions were $1.50 billion for 2022, 135% higher than 2021, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both Consumer platforms and Transaction banking and other.\nThe increase in Consumer platforms net revenues primarily reflected significantly higher credit card balances. The increase in Transaction banking and other net revenues reflected higher deposit balances.\nProvision for credit losses was $1.73 billion for 2022, compared with $697 million for 2021. Provisions for 2022 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio and net charge offs, while 2021 primarily reflected growth in the credit card portfolio, which was partially offset by reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses were $1.76 billion for 2022, 78% higher than 2021, reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer platforms, primarily from the inclusion of operating expenses related to GreenSky. Pre-tax loss was $1.99 billion for 2022, compared with $1.05 billion for 2021.\n2021 versus 2020.\nNet revenues in Platform Solutions were $640 million for 2021, 92% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Consumer platforms and higher net revenues in Transaction banking and other.\nNet revenues in Consumer platforms reflected higher credit card balances. Net revenues in Transaction banking and other reflected higher deposit balances.\nProvision for credit losses was $697 million for 2021, 43% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting growth in the credit card portfolio, including approximately $185 million of the provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio, partially offset by reserve reductions in the year reflecting continued improvement in the broad economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating expenses were $990 million for 2021, 57% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer platforms. Pre-tax loss was $1.05 billion for 2021, compared with $783 million for 2020.\nGeographic Data\nSee Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our total net revenues, pre-tax earnings and net earnings by geographic region.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nBalance Sheet and Funding Sources\nBalance Sheet Management\nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for information about our capital management process.\nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.\nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.\nBalance Sheet Planning.\nWe prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:\n•\nTo develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;\n•\nTo allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and\n•\nTo inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.\nTreasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.\nOur consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. See “Risk Management — Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for an overview of our risk management structure.\nBalance Sheet Limits.\nThe Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions.\nMonitoring of Key Metrics.\nWe monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.\nScenario Analyses.\nWe conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nBalance Sheet Analysis and Metrics\nAs of December 2022, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.44 trillion, a decrease of $22.19 billion from December 2021, reflecting decreases in trading assets of $74.67 billion (primarily due to decreases in equity securities, corporate debt instruments, reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), customer and other receivables of $25.23 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), cash and cash equivalents of $19.21 billion (primarily reflecting our activity), partially offset by increases in investments of $41.91 billion (primarily due to an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity), collateralized agreements of $29.68 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), and loans of $20.72 billion (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans).\nAs of December 2022, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.32 trillion, a decrease of $29.45 billion from December 2021, reflecting decreases in collateralized financings of $75.91 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities), partially offset by increases in deposits of $22.44 billion (primarily due to increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by other deposits), customer and other payables of $10.11 billion (primarily reflecting client activity), and trading liabilities of $9.90 billion (primarily due to an increase in equity securities, partially offset by a decrease in government obligations, both reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities).\nOur total repurchase agreements, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $110.35 billion as of December 2022 and $165.88 billion as of December 2021, which were 15% lower as of December 2022 and 3% higher as of December 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 27% lower as of December 2022 and 14% higher as of December 2021 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. As of December 2022, the decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from lower levels of our and our clients’ activities at the end of the period.\nThe level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.\nThe table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders’ equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets. This ratio is different from the leverage ratios included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\n•\nThe debt-to-equity ratio equals unsecured long-term borrowings divided by total shareholders’ equity.\nThe table below presents information about our shareholders’ equity and book value per common share, including the reconciliation of common shareholders’ equity to tangible common shareholders’ equity.\nIn the table above:\n•\nTangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n•\nBook value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements and not subject to performance or market conditions (collectively, basic shares) of 350.8 million as of December 2022 and 348.9 million as of December 2021. We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by basic shares) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFunding Sources\nOur primary sources of funding are deposits, collateralized financings, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and shareholders’ equity. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations.\nThe table below presents information about our funding sources.\nOur funding is primarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs.\nDeposits.\nOur deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all of our deposits are raised through GS Bank USA, GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE). See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits, including a maturity profile of our time deposits.\nSecured Funding.\nWe fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our collateralized financings, including its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA.\nWe seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage- and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities.\nWe also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We had no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank as of December 2022 and $100 million as of December 2021. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings.\nA significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S. hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.\nUnsecured Long-Term Borrowings.\nUnsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.\nThe table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile.\nThe weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of December 2022 was approximately six years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. We issued approximately $28 billion of benchmark debt during 2022, and we intend to issue significantly less benchmark debt in 2023 compared to our benchmark debt issuance in 2022, though actual issuances may differ due to business needs and market opportunities.\nShareholders’ Equity.\nShareholders’ equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders’ equity.\nCapital Management and Regulatory Capital\nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions.\nCapital Management\nWe determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets.\nWe manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels.\nWe principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock.\nWe may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock and subordinated debt.\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process.\nAs part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.\nOur capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOur stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in “Business — Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nAs required by the FRB’s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB’s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the stress capital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).\nBased on our 2022 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.4% to 6.3% for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. As a result, beginning on October 1, 2022, our Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement was 13.3%. Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, our G-SIB surcharge increased from 2.5% to 3.0%, resulting in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of 13.8%. See “Share Repurchase Program” for further information about common stock repurchases and dividends and “Consolidated Regulatory Capital” for further information about the G-SIB surcharge. We published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2022. See “Business — Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nGS Bank USA is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. GS Bank USA published a summary of its annual DFAST results in June 2022. See “Business — Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nGSI, GSIB and GSBE also have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators.\nContingency Capital Plan.\nAs part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess the capital usage of each of our businesses based on our attributed equity framework. This framework considers many factors, including our internal assessment of risks as well as the regulatory capital requirements related to our business activities. These regulatory capital requirements take into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is our CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Standardized Capital Rules. This requirement includes the SCB which is determined by the FRB based on its own annual stress test.\nShare Repurchase Program.\nWe use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) approved an increase in our common stock dividend from $2.00 to $2.50 per share. During 2022, we returned a total of $6.70 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.50 billion and common stock dividends of $3.20 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we returned a total of $2.38 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.50 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and return any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the first quarter of 2023 through February 23, 2023, our common stock repurchases were approximately $2.25 billion.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nSee “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a one percent non-deductible excise tax (buyback tax) on the fair market value of certain corporate share repurchases after December 31, 2022. The fair market value of share repurchases subject to the tax is reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued during the calendar year, including stock issued to employees. Based on our current understanding, we do not expect the buyback tax to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2023.\nResolution Capital Models.\nIn connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nRating Agency Guidelines\nThe credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc.\nThe level and composition of our capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See “Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management — Credit Ratings” for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital\nWe are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an “Advanced approaches” banking organization and have been designated as a G-SIB.\nThe capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under the Standardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capital buffer (under both Capital Rules) and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our G-SIB surcharge was 2.5% for 2022 and is 3.0% for 2023 and 2024. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points.\nSee Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\nWe are also subject to the FRB’s TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents TLAC and external long-term debt requirements.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe TLAC to RWAs requirement included (i) the 18% minimum, (ii) the 2.5% buffer, (iii) the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent and (iv) the 1.0% G-SIB surcharge (Method 1). Beginning in January 2023, our TLAC to RWAs requirement increased to 22.0%.\n•\nThe TLAC to leverage exposure requirement includes (i) the 7.5% minimum and (ii) the 2.0% leverage exposure buffer.\n•\nThe external long-term debt to RWAs requirement includes (i) the 6% minimum and (ii) the 2.5% G-SIB surcharge (Method 2). Beginning in January 2023, our external long-term debt to RWAs requirement increased to 9.0%.\n•\nThe external long-term debt to total leverage exposure is the 4.5% minimum.\nThe table below presents information about our TLAC and external long-term debt ratios.\nIn the table above:\n•\nTLAC includes common and preferred stock, and eligible long-term debt issued by Group Inc. Eligible long-term debt represents unsecured debt, which has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements.\n•\nExternal long-term debt consists of eligible long-term debt subject to a haircut if it is due to be paid between one and two years.\n•\nRWAs represent Advanced RWAs as of December 2022 and Standardized RWAs as of December 2021. In accordance with the TLAC rules, the higher of Advanced or Standardized RWAs are used in the calculation of TLAC and external long-term debt ratios and applicable requirements.\n•\nLeverage exposure consists of average adjusted total assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures.\nIn the second half of 2022, based on regulatory feedback, we revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the calculation of Standardized RWAs. As of December 2021, this change would have reduced our TLAC to RWAs ratio of 44.0% by 0.8 percentage points and our External long-term debt to RWAs ratio of 25.8% by 0.5 percentage points.\nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about TLAC.\nSubsidiary Capital Requirements\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.\nBank Subsidiaries.\nGS Bank USA is our primary U.S. banking subsidiary and GSIB and GSBE are our primary non-U.S. banking subsidiaries. These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries.\nU.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.\nGS&Co., our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary, is also a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart E of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGS&Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1, of $22.21 billion as of December 2022 and $22.18 billion as of December 2021, which exceeded the amount required by $17.46 billion as of December 2022 and $17.74 billion as of December 2021. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $5 billion and net capital in excess of $1 billion in accordance with Rule 15c3-1. GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $6 billion. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements.\nNon-U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.\nOur principal non-U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL.\nGSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). GSI is subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III).\nThe table below presents GSI’s risk-based capital requirements.\nIn the table above, the risk-based capital requirements incorporate capital guidance received from the PRA and could change in the future.\nThe table below presents information about GSI’s risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above, the risk-based capital ratios as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSI’s external auditors and approval by GSI's Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately 9 basis points to the CET1 capital ratio as of December 2022.\nGSI is also subject to the minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25% established by the PRA, which became effective in January 2023. GSI had a leverage ratio of 6.1% as of December 2022. The leverage ratio as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSI’s external auditors and approval by GSI's Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately 7 basis points to the leverage ratio as of December 2022.\nGSI is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GSI was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers.\nGSI is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. This requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from January 2019 and became fully effective beginning in January 2022. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GSI was in compliance with this requirement.\nGSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan’s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements.\nRegulatory and Other Matters\nRegulatory Matters\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations.\nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOther Matters\nReplacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR.\nOn January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings as representative rates will cease after June 2023. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP LIBOR settings in legacy GBP LIBOR-based derivative contracts through March 2024. The FCA has proposed to allow the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain USD LIBOR settings in legacy USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts through September 2024. The U.S. federal banking agencies’ guidance strongly encourages banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR.\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Asso\nciation (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA has confirmed that the FCA’s formal announcement to cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-USD LIBOR settings following December 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for USD LIBOR settings following June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. In December 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when USD LIBOR ceases to be published on June 30, 2023.\nWe facilitated an orderly transition from non-USD LIBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates and synthetic rates for us and our clients, and continue to make progress on our transition program as it relates to USD LIBOR.\nOur risk exposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in connection with our derivative contracts and, to a lesser extent, our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loan portfolio. As of December 2022, the notional amount of our USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts was approximately $6 trillion, of which approximately $5 trillion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. Substantially all of such derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol, or with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which have incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks and have announced that they plan to convert USD LIBOR contracts to alternative risk-free reference rates. Our unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with USD LIBOR exposure was approximately $29.0 billion as of December 2022, of which $26.4 billion will contractually mature after June 2023 or is perpetual and has no stated maturity date. Under the FRB’s final rule and the LIBOR Act, we will replace our USD LIBOR-based unsecured benchmark debt and preferred stock with term SOFR plus the statutorily prescribed tenor spread. This transition will take place following USD LIBOR cessation on June 30, 2023. In addition, our USD LIBOR-based loans were approximately $33.1 billion as of December 2022, of which approximately $30.5 billion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. A vast majority of such loans contain fallback provisions in the related loan agreements and we are actively engaging with our clients and syndicate partners to remediate the remaining loans agreements.\nWe have also issued de\nbt and deposits linked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. When appropriate, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our USD LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:\n•\nPurchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;\n•\nHolding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles;\n•\nEntering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and\n•\nProviding guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.\nWe enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.\nWe also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes.\nThe table below presents where information about our various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-K. In addition, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our consolidation policies.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nRisk Management\nRisks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. For further information about our risk management processes, see “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” and for information about our areas of risk, see “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management,” “Operational Risk Management,” “Model Risk Management” and “Other Risk Management,” as well as “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nOverview and Structure of Risk Management\nOverview\nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.\nGovernance.\nRisk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite.\nThe Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, model risk and climate risk, from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair and vice-chairs of our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.\nThe implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes is overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.\nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite.\nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax.\nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.\nProcesses.\nWe maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and control assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk metrics, reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making.\n•\nRisk Identification and Control Assessment.\nWe believe the identification of our risks and related control assessment is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and control assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. This approach also encompasses our control assessment, led by our second line of defense, to review and challenge the control environment to ensure it supports our strategic business plan.\nTo effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.\nAn important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for further information.\n•\nRisk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting.\nWe apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for approving our risk limits and thresholds policy, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits.\nThe Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance.\n•\nRisk Metrics, Reporting and Monitoring.\nEffective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk metrics, reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n•\nRisk Decision-Making.\nOur governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks.\nWe maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions.\nPeople.\nEven the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.\nWe reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.\nStructure\nUltimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We also have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees, councils or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact on our reputation of the transactions and activities that they oversee.\nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.\nThe chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nManagement Committee.\nThe Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.\nFirmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\nThe Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing all of our financial and nonfinancial risks. As part of such oversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing review, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk management framework, as well as our risk limits and thresholds policy, through delegated authority to the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. This committee also reviews new significant strategic business initiatives to determine whether they are consistent with our risk appetite and risk management capabilities. Additionally, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee performs enhanced reviews of significant risk events, the top residual and emerging risks, and the overall risk and control environment in each of our business units in order to propose uplifts, identify elements that are common to all business units and analyze the consolidated residual risks that we face. This committee, which reports to the Management Committee, is co-chaired by our president and chief operating officer and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and the vice-chair is our chief financial officer, who is appointed as vice-chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The following are the primary committees or councils that report to the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee (unless otherwise noted):\n•\nFirmwide Risk Council.\nThe Firmwide Risk Council is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of relevant financial risks and related risk limits at the firmwide, business and product levels. This council is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our chief risk officer.\n•\nFirmwide New Activity Committee.\nThe Firmwide New Activity Committee is responsible for reviewing new activities and for establishing a process to identify and review previously approved activities that are significant and that have changed in complexity and/or structure or present different reputational and suitability concerns over time to consider whether these activities remain appropriate. This committee is co-chaired by our controller and chief accounting officer and our chief operating and strategy officer for Engineering, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n•\nFirmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee.\nThe Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience. To assist the Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee in carrying out its mandate, other risk committees with dedicated oversight for technology-related risks, including cybersecurity matters, report into the Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee. This committee is co-chaired by our chief administrative officer for EMEA and our head of Operational Risk, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n•\nFirmwide Conduct Committee.\nThe Firmwide Conduct Committee is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of the frameworks and policies which govern our conduct risks. Conduct risk is the risk that our people fail to act in a manner consistent with our Business Principles and related core values, policies or codes, or applicable laws or regulations, thereby falling short in fulfilling their responsibilities to us, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community. This committee is chaired by our chief legal officer, who is appoin\nted as chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\n•\nFirmwide Risk Appetite Committee.\nThe Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee) is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of risk frameworks, policies and parameters related to our core risk management processes, as well as limits and thresholds, at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, this committee is responsible for overseeing our financial risks and reviews the results of stress tests and scenario analyses. To assist the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee in carrying out its mandate, a number of other risk committees with dedicated oversight for stress testing, model risks, Volcker Rule compliance, as well as our investments or other capital commitments that may give rise to financial risk, report into the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee. This committee is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is appointed as chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The Firmwide Capital Committee and Firmwide Commitments Committee report to the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee.\nFirmwide Capital Comm\nittee.\nThe Firmwide Capital Committee provides approval and oversight of debt-related transactions, including principal commitments of our capital. This committee aims to ensure that business, reputational and suitability standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. This committee is co-chaired by our head of Credit Risk and a co-head of our Global Financing Group, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFirmwide Commitments Committee.\nThe Firmwide Commitments Committee reviews our underwriting and distribution activities with respect to equity and equity-related product offerings, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global basis. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, this committee periodically conducts general strategic reviews of sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. This committee is co-chaired by our chief equity underwriting officer for the Americas, a co-chairman of our Global Financial Institutions Group and a co-head of our Global Investment Grade Capital Markets and Risk Management Group in Global Banking & Markets, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee.\n•\nFirmwide Reputational Risk Committee.\nThe Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee is responsible for assessing reputational risks arising from transactions that have been identified as having potential heightened reputational risk pursuant to the criteria established by the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee and as determined by committee leadership. This committee is also responsible for overseeing client-related business standards and addressing client-related reputational risk. This committee is chaired by our president and chief operating officer, who is appointed as chair by our chief executive officer, and the vice-chairs are our chief legal officer and the head of Conflicts Resolution, who are appointed as vice-chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. This committee periodically provides updates to, and receives guidance from, the Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board. The Firmwide Suitability Committee reports to the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee.\nFirmwide Suitability Committee.\nThe Firmwide Suitability Committee is responsible for setting standards and policies for product, transaction and client suitability and providing a forum for consistency across functions, regions and products on suitability assessments. This committee also reviews suitability matters escalated from other committees. This committee is co-chaired by our chief compliance officer, and the head of Net Zero Transition Solutions in Global Banking & Markets, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee.\nFirmwide Asset Liability Committee.\nThe Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews and approves the strategic direction for our financial resources, including capital, liquidity, funding and balance sheet. This committee has oversight responsibility for asset liability management, including interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer pricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. This committee makes recommendations as to any adjustments to asset liability management and financial resource allocation in light of current events, risks, exposures, and regulatory requirements and approves related policies. This committee is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOverview\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.\nTreasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite.\nLiquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for identifying, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLiquidity Risk Management Principles\nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan.\nGCLA.\nGCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.\nOur GCLA reflects the following principles:\n•\nThe first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company’s survival;\n•\nFocus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;\n•\nDuring a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and\n•\nAs a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs.\nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.’s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.\nAsset-Liability Management.\nOur liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\nOur approach to asset-liability management includes:\n•\nConservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources — Funding Sources” for further information;\n•\nActively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources — Balance Sheet Management” for further information about our balance sheet management process and “— Funding Sources — Secured Funding” for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and\n•\nRaising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders’ equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.\nSubsidiary Funding Policies\nThe majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.\nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary’s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing.\nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2022, Group Inc. had $39.33 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $47.74 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.62 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $52.55 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $4.25 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $108.14 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $52.93 billion) and $30.16 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of December 2022. In addition, as of December 2022, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.\nContingency Funding Plan.\nWe maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.\nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nModeled Liquidity Outflow.\nOur Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:\n•\nSeverely challenged market environments, which include low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and\n•\nA firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade.\nThe following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow:\n•\nLiquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;\n•\nA two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings;\n•\nChanging conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding;\n•\nNo support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and\n•\nA combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments, and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements.\nIntraday Liquidity Model.\nOur Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.\nLong-Term Stress Testing.\nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\nResolution Liquidity Models.\nIn connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLimits\nWe use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.\nLimits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\nGCLA and Unencumbered Metrics\nGCLA.\nBased on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both December 2022 and December 2021 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.\nThe table below presents information about our GCLA.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of (i) unencumbered U.S. government and agency obligations (including highly liquid U.S. agency mortgage-backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal Reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight U.S. dollar cash deposits.\n•\nThe non-U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of non-U.S. government obligations (only unencumbered German, French, Japanese and U.K. government obligations) and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies.\nWe maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements.\nOther Unencumbered Assets.\nIn addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $273.49 billion for the three months ended December 2022, $271.65 billion for the three months ended December 2021, $275.69 billion for the year ended December 2022 and $249.32 billion for the year ended December 2021. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.\nLiquidity Regulatory Framework\nAs a BHC, we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR.\nThe table below presents information about our average daily LCR.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nAs a BHC, we are subject to a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, which requires large U.S. banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. The rule also requires disclosure of our quarterly average daily NSFR on a semi-annual basis and a description of the banking organization’s stable funding sources. We will begin doing so in August 2023. Our NSFR as of December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement.\nThe following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:\n•\nGS Bank USA.\nGS Bank USA is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of December 2022, GS Bank USA’s LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The NSFR requirement described above also applies to GS Bank USA. As of December 2022, GS Bank USA’s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n•\nGSI and GSIB.\nGSI and GSIB are subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities. GSI’s and GSIB’s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSI and GSIB are subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the U.K. As of December 2022, both GSI’s and GSIB’s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n•\nGSBE.\nGSBE is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council. GSBE’s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended December 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSBE is subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the E.U. As of December 2022, GSBE’s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement.\n•\nOther Subsidiaries.\nWe monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee’s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments.\nThe implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.\nCredit Ratings\nWe rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.\nThe table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of Group Inc.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe ratings and outlook are by DBRS, Inc. (DBRS), Fitch, Inc. (Fitch), Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P).\n•\nThe ratings for trust preferred relate to the guaranteed preferred beneficial interests issued by Goldman Sachs Capital I.\n•\nThe DBRS, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P ratings for preferred stock include the APEX issued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\nWe believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies’ assessment of:\n•\nOur liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices;\n•\nOur level and variability of earnings;\n•\nOur capital base;\n•\nOur franchise, reputation and management;\n•\nOur corporate governance; and\n•\nThe external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution.\nCertain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings.\nCash Flows\nAs a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.\nYear Ended December 2022.\nOur cash and cash equivalents decreased by $19.21 billion to $241.83 billion at the end of 2022, primarily due to net cash used for investing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments (primarily U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity) and an increase in net lending activities (reflecting increases in other collateralized and consumer loans). The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings and deposits (reflecting increases in transaction banking and private bank and consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other deposits). The net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash inflows from trading assets and liabilities, customer and other receivables and payables, net (reflecting both a decrease in customer and other receivables and an increase in customer and other payables), net earnings and loans held for sale, net, partially offset by cash outflows from collateralized transactions (reflecting both a decrease in collateralized financings and an increase in collateralized agreements). The decrease in cash and cash equivalents as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates was due to the U.S. dollar strengthening during the year. Such amount was $11.56 billion for 2022 ($3.42 billion for the three months ended March 2022, $10.34 billion for the six months ended June 2022 and $18.17 billion for the nine months ended September 2022).\nYear Ended December 2021\n. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $105.19 billion to $261.04 billion at the end of 2021, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits (reflecting increases across channels) and net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments and an increase in net lending activities, partially offset by sales and paydowns of investments.\nFor an analysis of cash flows for the year ended December 2020, see Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nMarket Risk Management\nOverview\nMarket risk is the risk of an adverse impact to our earnings due to changes in market conditions. Our assets and liabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include positions held for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following:\n•\nInterest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;\n•\nEquity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices;\n•\nCurrency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and\n•\nCommodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.\nMarket Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses.\nManagers in revenue-producing units, Treasury and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units and Treasury are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.\nMarket Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following:\n•\nMonitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures;\n•\nDiversifying exposures;\n•\nControlling position sizes; and\n•\nEvaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives.\nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR), Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) and other stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.\nRisk Measures\nWe produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.\nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, EaR and other stress tests.\nOur risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.\nValue-at-Risk.\nVaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see “Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.” We typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include:\n•\nVaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme;\n•\nVaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and\n•\nPrevious moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves.\nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.\nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.\nOur VaR measure does not include:\n•\nPositions that are not accounted for at fair value, such as held-to-maturity securities and loans, deposits and unsecured borrowings that are accounted for at amortized cost;\n•\nAvailable-for-sale securities for which the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss);\n•\nPositions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and\n•\nThe impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.\nWe perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.\nEarnings-at-Risk.\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, we started managing our interest rate risk using the EaR metric. EaR measures the estimated impact of changes in interest rates to our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over a defined time horizon. EaR complements the VaR metric, which measures the impact of interest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities (i.e., mark-to-market changes). Our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n•\nDifferences in maturity or repricing dates of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments.\n•\nDifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments with the same maturity or repricing dates.\n•\nCertain interest rate sensitive fees.\nTreasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all businesses through our investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives. We measure EaR over a one-year time horizon following a 100-basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short- and long-term interest rates. This sensitivity is calculated relative to a baseline market scenario, which takes into consideration, among other things, the market’s expectation of forward rates, as well as our expectation of future business activity. This scenario includes contractual elements of assets, liabilities, preferred stock, and certain off-balance sheet instruments, such as rates of interest, principal repayment schedules, maturity and reset dates, and any interest rate ceilings or floors, as well as assumptions with respect to our balance sheet size and composition, deposit repricing and prepayment behavior. We manage EaR with a goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within our EaR risk appetite. Our EaR scenario is regularly evaluated and updated, if necessary, to reflect changes in our business plans, market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. While management uses the best information available to estimate EaR, actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, changes in the economic environment or assumptions used in the process.\nRisk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, and Treasury, have primary responsibility for assessing and monitoring EaR through firmwide oversight, including oversight of EaR stress testing and assumptions, and the establishment of our EaR risk appetite.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nStress Testing.\nStress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. In addition to EaR, we use other stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.\nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\nLimits\nWe use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR, EaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.\nLimits are monitored by Treasury and Risk. Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted.\nMetrics\nWe analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR.\nOur average daily VaR increased to $114 million in 2022 from $86 million in 2021, due to higher levels of volatility, partially offset by reduced exposures. The total increase was driven by increases in the interest rates, commodity prices and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect and a decrease in the equity prices category.\nThe table below presents our period-end VaR.\nOur period-end VaR increased to $103 million as of December 2022 from $91 million as of December 2021, due to higher levels of volatility, partially offset by reduced exposures. The total increase was primarily driven by increases in the interest rates and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect and a decrease in the commodity prices category.\nDuring 2022, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on six occasions (all of which occurred during March 2022) primarily due to higher levels of volatility generally resulting from broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. These limit breaches were resolved by temporary increases in the firmwide VaR risk limit and subsequent risk reductions. During this period, the firmwide VaR risk limit was also permanently increased due to higher levels of volatility. During 2021, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded and there were no permanent or temporary changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents our high and low VaR.\nThe chart below presents our daily VaR for 2022.\nThe table below presents, by number of business days, the frequency distribution of our daily net revenues for positions included in VaR.\nDaily net revenues for positions included in VaR are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our 95% one-day VaR (i.e., a VaR exception) on two occasions during 2022 and on one occasion during 2021.\nDuring periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.\nSensitivity Measures\nCertain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure. Other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below.\n10% Sensitivity Measures.\nThe table below presents our market risk by asset category for positions accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10% decline in the value of these positions.\n•\nEquity positions relate to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in hedge funds.\n•\nDebt positions include interests in funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, corporate bank loans and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans.\n•\nFunded equity and debt positions are included in our consolidated balance sheets in investments and loans. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about investments and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans.\n•\nThese measures do not reflect the diversification effect across asset categories or across other market risk measures.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCredit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities.\nVaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $1 million as of both December 2022 and December 2021. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $37 million as of December 2022 and $33 million as of December 2021. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken.\nEarnings-at-Risk.\nThe table below presents the impact of a parallel shift in rates on our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over the next 12 months relative to the baseline scenario.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe EaR metric utilized various assumptions, including, among other things, balance sheet size and composition, deposit repricing and prepayment behavior, all of which have inherent uncertainties. The EaR metric does not represent a forecast of our net revenues and preferred stock dividends.\n•\nThe change in our sensitivities as of December 2022 compared to December 2021 primarily reflects the impact of changes in our investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.\n•\nThe -100 basis points parallel shift in rates scenario was not meaningful as of December 2021 given the low interest rate environment.\nOther Market Risk Considerations\nWe make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nDirect investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about other assets.\nFinancial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures\nWe employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections above, to monitor market risk across the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of earnings. The related gains and losses on these positions are included in market making, other principal transactions, interest income and interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and debt valuation adjustment and unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale securities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe table below presents certain assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets and the market risk measures used to assess those assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to the above, we measure the interest rate risk for all positions within our consolidated balance sheets using the EaR metric.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCredit Risk Management\nOverview\nCredit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables.\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk.\nCredit Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following:\n•\nMonitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations;\n•\nEstablishing or approving underwriting standards;\n•\nAssessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations;\n•\nMeasuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default;\n•\nUsing credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and\n•\nMaximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims.\nWe also perform credit analyses, which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. We determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty’s industry and the economic environment. The internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral value, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.\nOur credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.\nRisk Measures\nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nStress Tests\nWe conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.\nLimits\nWe use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.\nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\nRisk Mitigants\nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.\nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty’s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty’s obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCredit Exposures\nAs of December 2022, our aggregate credit exposure decreased compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting decreases in receivables from clearing organizations and cash deposits with central banks, partially offset by an increase in loans and lending commitments. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) decreased compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting a decrease in non-investment-grade loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposures are described further below.\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\nOur credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nThe table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $16.94 billion as of December 2022 and $24.87 billion as of December 2021.\nOTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.\nWe generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.\nThe table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region.\nOur credit exposure (before any potential recoveries) to OTC derivative counterparties that defaulted during 2022 remained low, representing less than 2% of our total credit exposure from OTC derivatives.\nIn the table above:\n•\nOTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting).\n•\nCollateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents the distribution of our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives by tenor.\nIn the table above:\n•\nTenor is based on remaining contractual maturity.\n•\nNetting includes counterparty netting across tenor categories and collateral that we consider when determining credit risk (including collateral that is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP). Counterparty netting within the same tenor category is included within such tenor category.\nThe tables below present the distribution of our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives by tenor and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nLending Activities.\nWe manage our lending activities using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. Other lending positions, including secondary trading positions, are risk-managed as a component of market risk. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we changed the classification of our lending portfolio to better reflect the nature of the underlying collateral. Loans and lending commitments types in the table below include the addition of securities-based and other collateralized, as well as the removal of wealth management. This also resulted in reclassifications of certain loans and lending commitments in corporate and other to other collateralized. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.\nThe table below presents our loans and lending commitments.\nIn the table above, lending commitments excluded $4.85 billion as of December 2022 and $4.14 billion as of December 2021 relating to issued letters of credit which are classified as guarantees in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about guarantees.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about net charge-offs on wholesale and consumer loans, as well as past due and nonaccrual loans accounted for at amortized cost.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCorporate.\nCorporate loans and lending commitments include term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans are secured (typically by a senior lien on the assets of the borrower) or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from corporate loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by industry, region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nCommercial Real Estate.\nCommercial real estate includes originated loans and lending commitments that are directly or indirectly secured by hotels, retail stores, multifamily housing complexes and commercial and industrial properties. Commercial real estate also includes loans and lending commitments extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate. In addition, commercial real estate includes loans purchased by us.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from commercial real estate loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above, credit exposure includes loans and lending commitments of $10.28 billion as of December 2022 and $11.65 billion as of December 2021 which are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate.\nIn addition, we also have credit exposure to commercial real estate loans held for securitization of $119 million as of December 2022 and $922 million as of December 2021. Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nResidential Real Estate.\nResidential real estate loans and lending commitments are primarily extended to wealth management clients and to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate. In addition, residential real estate includes loans purchased by us.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from residential real estate loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above:\n•\nCredit exposure includes loans and lending commitments of $14.62 billion as of December 2022 and $16.89 billion as of December 2021 which are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate.\n•\nOther metrics category consists of loans where we use other key metrics to assess the borrower's credit quality, such as loan-to-value ratio, delinquency status, collateral value, expected cash flows and other risk factors.\nIn addition, we also have credit exposure to residential real estate loans held for securitization of $8.07 billion as of December 2022 and $11.57 billion as of December 2021. Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nSecurities-Based.\nSecurities-based includes loans and lending commitments that are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans and commitments are primarily extended to our wealth management clients and used for purposes other than purchasing, carrying or trading margin stocks. Securities-based loans require borrowers to post additional collateral based on changes in the underlying collateral's fair value.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from securities-based loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above, other metrics category consists of loans where we use other key metrics to assess the borrower's credit quality, such as collateral value, loan-to-value ratio and delinquency status.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOther Collateralized.\nOther collateralized includes loans and lending commitments that are backed by specific collateral (other than securities and real estate). Such loans and lending commitments are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by corporate loans, consumer loans and other assets. Other collateralized also includes loans and lending commitments to investment funds (managed by third parties) that are collateralized by capital commitments of the funds' investors or assets held by the fund, as well as other secured loans and lending commitments extended to our wealth management clients.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from other collateralized loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above, credit exposure included loans and lending commitments extended to clients who warehouse assets of $16.89 billion as of December 2022 and $13.73 billion as of December 2021.\nInstallment and Credit Cards.\nWe originate unsecured installment loans (including point-of-sale loans that we began to originate through the GreenSky platform in the third quarter of 2022) and credit card loans (pursuant to revolving lines of credit) to consumers in the Americas. The credit card lines are cancellable by us and therefore do not result in credit exposure.\nThe tables below present our credit exposure from originated installment and credit card funded loans, and the concentration by the five most concentrated U.S. states.\nIn addition, we had credit exposure of $1.88 billion as of December 2022 and $9 million as of December 2021 related to our commitments to provide unsecured installment loans to consumers.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the credit quality indicators of installment and credit card loans.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOther.\nOther includes unsecured loans extended to wealth management clients and unsecured consumer and credit card loans purchased by us.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from other loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above, other metrics primarily includes consumer and credit card loans purchased by us. Our risk assessment process for such loans includes reviewing certain key metrics, such as expected cash flows, delinquency status and other risk factors.\nIn addition, we also have credit exposure to other loans held for securitization of $1.76 billion as of December 2022 and $467 million as of December 2021. Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nCredit Hedges.\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with our lending activities, we obtain credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes.\nSecurities Financing Transactions.\nWe enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral for these transactions primarily includes U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from securities financing transactions and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nThe table above reflects both netting agreements and collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOther Credit Exposures.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.\nThe table below presents our other credit exposures and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nThe table above reflects collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\nSelected Exposures\nWe have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus given recent events and broad market concerns. Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short positions due to changes in market prices.\nCountry Exposures.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to negatively affect the global economy and has resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets and increased macroeconomic uncertainty. Governments around the world have responded to Russia’s invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on specific industry sectors, companies and individuals in Russia. Retaliatory restrictions against investors, non-Russian owned businesses and other sovereign states have been implemented by Russia. Businesses in the U.S. and globally continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due, in part, to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine presents heightened risks relating to cyber attacks, limited ability to settle securities transactions, third-party and agent bank dependencies, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, as well as the potential for increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets. Complying with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has resulted in increased operational risk. The extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, as well as the potential adverse consequences for our business, liquidity and results of operations, are difficult to predict.\nOur senior management, risk committees and the Board receive regular briefings from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including our chief risk officer, on Russian and Ukrainian exposures, as well as other relevant risk metrics. We have significantly reduced our exposure to Russia and Ukraine and have curtailed our operations in Russia to those necessary to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. The overall direct financial impact to our net revenues for 2022 from Russian and Ukrainian counterparties, borrowers, issuers and related instruments was not material. We have established a firmwide working group to identify and assess the operational risk associated with complying with economic sanctions and restrictions as a result of this invasion. In addition, to mitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks, we liaise with government agencies in order to update our monitoring processes with the latest information.\nOur total credit exposure to Russian or Ukrainian counterparties or borrowers and our total market exposure relating to Russian or Ukrainian issuers was not material as of December 2022.\nIn addition, economic and/or political uncertainties in Argentina, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela have led to concerns about their financial stability. Our credit exposure to counterparties or borrowers and our market exposure to issuers relating to each of these countries was not material as of December 2022.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nWe have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer’s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See “Stress Tests” for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries.\nOperational Risk Management\nOverview\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.\nPotential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:\n•\nExecution, delivery and process management;\n•\nBusiness disruption and system failures;\n•\nEmployment practices and workplace safety;\n•\nClients, products and business practices;\n•\nDamage to physical assets;\n•\nInternal fraud; and\n•\nExternal fraud.\nOperational Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite.\nOperational Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events.\nWe combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management.\nWe maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring operational resilience of our business.\nOur operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.\nWe have established policies that require all employees and consultants to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.\nWe use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and control assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nRisk Measurement\nWe measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including:\n•\nEvaluations of the complexity of our business activities;\n•\nThe degree of automation in our processes;\n•\nNew activity information;\n•\nThe legal and regulatory environment; and\n•\nChanges in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties.\nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nTypes of Operational Risks\nIncreased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cybersecurity risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows:\nInformation and Cybersecurity Risk.\nInformation and cybersecurity risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cybersecurity threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about information and cybersecurity risk.\nThird-Party Risk.\nThird-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cybersecurity, resilience and additional supply chain dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further information about third-party risk.\nBusiness Resilience Risk.\nBusiness resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. Our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide basis, and up-to-date, incorporating new information, including updated resilience capabilities as and when they become available. Our resilience assurance program encompasses testing of response and recovery strategies on a regular basis with the objective of minimizing and preventing significant operational disruptions. See “Business — Business Continuity and Information Security” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about business continuity.\nModel Risk Management\nOverview\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital.\nModel Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOur model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework.\nModel Review and Validation Process\nModel Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards.\nWe regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation.\nThe model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:\n•\nThe model’s conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use;\n•\nThe testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended;\n•\nThe suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model;\n•\nThe model’s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks;\n•\nThe model’s consistency with models for similar products; and\n•\nThe model’s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions.\nSee “Critical Accounting Policies — Fair Value — Review of Valuation Models,” “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management” and “Operational Risk Management” for further information about our use of models within these areas.\nOther Risk Management\nIn addition to the areas of risks discussed above, we also manage other risks, including capital, climate, compliance and conflicts. These areas of risks are discussed below.\nCapital Risk Management\nCapital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to identify and comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” for further information about our capital management process.\nWe have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our day-to-day capital management activities and to ensure compliance with capital rules and related policies. Our capital management activities are overseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the Risk Committee of the Board approves our capital management policy, which details the risk committees and members of senior management who are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluation of current and future regulatory capital requirements, the review of the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models. In addition, our risk committees and senior management are responsible for the review of our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, and capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, as well as monitoring capital targets and potential breaches of capital requirements.\nOur process for managing capital risk also includes independent review by Risk that, among other things, assesses regulatory capital policies and related interpretations, escalates certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, and performs calculation testing to corroborate alignment with applicable capital rules.\nClimate Risk Management\nWe categorize climate risk into physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nAs a global financial institution, climate-related risks manifest in different ways across our businesses and we have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate into our broader risk management processes. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. Senior management within Risk is responsible for the development of our climate risk program.\nWe have begun incorporating climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries. Climate risk factors are now evaluated as part of transaction due diligence for select loan commitments.\nSee “Business — Sustainability” in Part I, Item 1 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition.\nCompliance Risk Management\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nConflicts Management\nConflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term “conflict of interest” does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees.\nWe have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, and internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.\nAs a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Global Banking & Markets and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer.\nWe regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nFor further information about our risk management processes, see “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

    "text": "Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The firm’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the firm’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs of December 31, 2022, management conducted an assessment of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 was effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the firm’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nThe firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PCAOB ID\n238\n), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on pages 120 to 122, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes $26.0 billion of financial assets and $22.8 billion of financial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as one or more inputs to the financial instrument’s valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included (i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads or (iii) correlation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of these certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in valuing the financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing an independent estimate of fair value or (ii) testing management’s process to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, (ii) evaluating and utilizing management’s significant unobservable inputs or developing independent significant unobservable inputs, and (iii) comparing management’s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management’s process included evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to determine the fair value of these instruments.\nReport of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Wholesale Loan Portfoli\no\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio reflects management’s estimate of loan losses over the remaining expected life of the loans and also considers forecasts of future economic conditions. As of December 31, 2022, $2.6 billion of the allowance for loan losses and $150.4 billion of the loans accounted for at amortized cost related to the wholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. In addition, it includes qualitative components to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The wholesale models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans include forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the determinations of internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determinations, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio, including controls over the model, certain data, and significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, which involved evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The procedures also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the model and methodology and (ii) the reasonableness of the internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates used in estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 23, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1922.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

(Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the firm), is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in all major financial centers around the world.\nCommencing with the fourth quarter of 2022, consistent with the firm's previously announced organizational changes, the firm began managing and reporting its activities in the following\nthree\nbusiness segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. Prior periods are presented on a comparable basis.\nGlobal Banking & Markets\nThe firm provides a broad range of services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments.

Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nAll references to 2022, 2021 and 2020 refer to the firm’s years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Any reference to a future year refers to a year ending on December 31 of that year. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 3.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe firm’s significant accounting policies include when and how to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, measuring the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, and when to consolidate an entity. See Note 4 for policies on fair value measurements, Note 9 for policies on the allowance for credit losses, and below and Note 17 for policies on consolidation accounting.\nAll other significant accounting policies are either described below or included in the following footnotes:\nConsolidation\nThe firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE).\nVoting Interest Entities.\nVoting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated.\nVariable Interest Entities.\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs.\nEquity-Method Investments.\nWhen the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity’s common stock or in-substance common stock.\nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm’s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Funds.\nThe firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, but actual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value.\nTrading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients.\nThe firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed.\nRevenues from contracts with clients represent approximately\n50\n% of total non-interest revenues for 2022 (including approximately\n85\n% of investment banking revenues, approximately\n95\n% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), approximately\n45\n% of total non-interest revenues for 2021 (including approximately\n90\n% of both investment banking revenues and investment management revenues, and all commissions and fees), and approximately\n45\n% of total non-interest revenues for 2020 (including approximately\n90\n% of investment banking revenues, approximately\n95\n% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees). See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment.\nInvestment Banking\nAdvisory.\nFees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Non-refundable deposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded.\nExpenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in transaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues.\nUnderwriting.\nFees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment.\nExpenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in transaction based expenses for completed assignments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Management\nThe firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm’s investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in transaction based expenses.\nManagement Fees.\nManagement fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds and separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of month-end net asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund’s net asset value or the committed capital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses.\nIncentive Fees.\nIncentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund’s or separately managed account’s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund.\nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\nCommissions and Fees\nThe firm earns substantially all commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm’s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm’s investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the net asset value of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account.\nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2022, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2030. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $\n300\nmillion through 2030.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $\n7.87\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n10.14\nbillion as of December 2021. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $\n233.96\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n250.90\nbillion as of December 2021.\nThe firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $\n16.94\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n24.87\nbillion as of December 2021. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities.\nCustomer and Other Receivables\nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $\n67.88\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n103.82\nbillion as of December 2021, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $\n67.57\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n56.85\nbillion as of December 2021. Such receivables primarily consist of collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions, customer margin loans and receivables resulting from unsettled transactions.\nSubstantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these receivables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income.\nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm’s right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time. The firm’s receivables from contracts with clients were $\n3.01\nbillion as of both December 2022 and December 2021. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, contract assets were not material.\nCustomer and Other Payables\nCustomer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $\n238.12\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n241.93\nbillion as of December 2021, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $\n23.93\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n10.00\nbillion as of December 2021. Such payables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm’s prime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these payables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Interest on customer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest expense.\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities\nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm’s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S. operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASC 848).\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform — Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” This ASU, as amended in 2022, provides optional relief from applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In addition, in January 2021 the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform — Scope,” which clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating to contract modifications. The firm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected to apply the relief available to certain modified derivatives. The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures (ASC 326)\n.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326) — Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures.” This ASU eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and requires enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosure for loans that have been charged off. The ASU became effective in January 2023 under a prospective approach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Obligations to Safeguard Crypto-Assets an Entity Holds for Platform Users (SAB 121)\n.\nIn March 2022, the SEC staff issued SAB 121 (SAB 121) — “Accounting for obligations to safeguard crypto-assets an entity holds for platform users.” SAB 121 adds interpretive guidance requiring an entity to recognize a liability on its balance sheet to reflect the obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets held for its platform users, along with a corresponding asset. The firm adopted SAB 121 in June 2022 under a modified retrospective approach and adoption did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASC 820).\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.” This ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security should not be considered in measuring its fair value. In addition, the ASU requires specific disclosures related to equity securities that are subject to contractual sale restrictions. The ASU is effective in January 2024 under a prospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 4.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks).\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate).\nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument’s level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1.\nInputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3.\nOne or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable.\nThe fair values for substantially all of the firm’s financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm’s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\nThe table below presents financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value.\nIn the table above:\n•\nCounterparty netting among positions classified in the same level is included in that level.\n•\nCounterparty and cash collateral netting represents the impact on derivatives of netting across levels.\nThe table below presents a summary of level 3 financial assets.\nLevel 3 financial assets as of December 2022 increased compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in level 3 investments. See Note 5 for further information about level 3 financial assets (including information about unrealized gains and losses related to level 3 financial assets and transfers in and out of level 3).\nThe valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the firm’s financial instruments are described below. See Note 5 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 financial instruments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans\nLevel 1.\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S. government obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity.\nLevel 2.\nLevel 2 instruments include certain non-U.S. government obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\nValuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\nLevel 3.\nLevel 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 instrument are described below:\nLoans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include:\n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices, such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance of commercial mortgage bonds);\n•\nTransaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral;\n•\nA measure of expected future cash flows in a default scenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of the underlying collateral, which is mainly driven by current performance of the underlying collateral and capitalization rates. Recovery rates are expressed as a percentage of notional or face value of the instrument and reflect the benefit of credit enhancements on certain instruments; and\n•\nTiming of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in certain cases, may incorporate the impact of any loan forbearances and other unobservable inputs (e.g., prepayment speeds).\nLoans and Securities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include:\n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets;\n•\nTransaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral;\n•\nCumulative loss expectations, driven by default rates, home price projections, residential property liquidation timelines, related costs and subsequent recoveries; and\n•\nDuration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds and residential property liquidation timelines.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCorporate Debt Instruments\nCorporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt securities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs for corporate debt instruments are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same or similar issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include:\n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks the performance of corporate credit);\n•\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation;\n•\nDuration; and\n•\nMarket and transaction multiples for corporate debt instruments with convertibility or participation options.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities consists of private equities. Recent third-party completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger proposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are considered the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate:\n•\nIndustry multiples (primarily EBITDA and revenue multiples) and public comparables;\n•\nTransactions in similar instruments;\n•\nDiscounted cash flow techniques; and\n•\nThird-party appraisals.\nThe firm also considers changes in the outlook for the relevant industry and financial performance of the issuer as compared to projected performance. Significant inputs include:\n•\nMarket and transaction multiples;\n•\nDiscount rates and capitalization rates; and\n•\nFor equity securities with debt-like features, market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets, current performance and recovery assumptions, and duration.\nOther Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other instruments, such as non-U.S. government and agency obligations, state and municipal obligations, and other loans and debt obligations are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include:\n•\nMarket yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices;\n•\nCurrent performance and recovery assumptions and, where the firm uses credit default swaps to value the related instrument, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligation; and\n•\nDuration.\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Derivatives\nThe firm’s level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using derivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, correlation models and models that incorporate option pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generally be characterized by product type, as described below.\n•\nInterest Rate.\nIn general, the key inputs used to value interest rate derivatives are transparent, even for most long-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and options denominated in the currencies of leading industrialized nations are characterized by high trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year swap rate vs. 2-year swap rate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generally observable.\n•\nCredit.\nPrice transparency for credit default swaps, including both single names and baskets of credits, varies by market and underlying reference entity or obligation. Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most price transparency. For credit default swaps with other underliers, price transparency varies based on credit rating, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the availability of the underlying reference obligations for delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and emerging market debt instruments tend to have less price transparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In addition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more underlying reference obligations, generally have less price transparency.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nCurrency.\nPrices for currency derivatives based on the exchange rates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be only observable for contracts with shorter tenors.\n•\nCommodity.\nCommodity derivatives include transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and electricity), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices.\n•\nEquity.\nPrice transparency for equity derivatives varies by market and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or reference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency.\nLiquidity is essential to the observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs.\nLevel 1.\nLevel 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.\nLevel 2.\nLevel 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.\nThe selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels.\nValuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\nLevel 3\n. Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm’s level 3 derivatives are described below.\n•\nFor level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include correlations of certain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between Euro inflation and Euro interest rates) and specific interest rate and currency volatilities.\n•\nFor level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront credit points, which are unique to specific reference obligations and reference entities, and recovery rates.\n•\nFor level 3 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices and prices or spreads for certain products for which the product quality or physical location of the commodity is not aligned with benchmark indices.\n•\nFor level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options that are long-dated and/or have strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices. In addition, the valuation of certain structured trades requires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as the correlation of the price performance of two or more individual stocks or the correlation of the price performance for a basket of stocks to another asset class, such as commodities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 5 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives.\nValuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels.\nIn addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction.\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Other Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nIn addition to trading cash instruments, derivatives, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Such instruments include resale and repurchase agreements; certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and certain other assets and liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm’s credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm’s other financial instruments are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and interest rates.\nCustomer and Other Receivables.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads.\nDeposits.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm’s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 13 for further information about deposits.\nOther Secured Financings.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other secured financings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, funding spreads and the fair value of the collateral delivered by the firm (determined using the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings.\nUnsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the firm and commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm’s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 14 for further information about borrowings.\nOther Assets and Liabilities.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other assets and liabilities are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, market yields, volatility and correlation inputs. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm’s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 5.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nFinancial assets and liabilities at fair value includes trading cash instruments, derivatives, and certain investments, loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value.\nFair Value of Trading Cash Instruments by Level\nThe table below presents trading cash instruments by level within the fair value hierarchy.\nTrading cash instruments consists of instruments held in connection with the firm’s market-making or risk management activities. These instruments are carried at fair value and the related fair value gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nIn the table above:\n•\nTrading cash instrument assets are shown as positive amounts and trading cash instrument liabilities are shown as negative amounts.\n•\nCorporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt securities, convertible debentures, prepaid commodity transactions and transfers of assets accounted for as secured loans rather than purchases.\n•\nOther debt obligations includes other asset-backed securities and money market instruments.\n•\nEquity securities includes public equities and exchange-traded funds.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of trading cash instruments.\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs for Trading Cash Instrument Assets\nThe table below presents the amount of level 3 assets, and ranges and weighted averages of significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 trading cash instrument assets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above:\n•\nOther includes government and agency obligations, state and municipal obligations, other debt obligations, equity securities and commodities. In other, the significant unobservable inputs for multiples as of December 2021 did not have a range (and there was no weighted average) as each pertained to a single position. Therefore, such unobservable inputs are not included in the table above.\n•\nRanges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of trading cash instrument.\n•\nWeighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the trading cash instruments.\n•\nThe ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one trading cash instrument. For example, the highest recovery rate for corporate debt instruments is appropriate for valuing a specific corporate debt instrument, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other corporate debt instrument. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 trading cash instruments.\n•\nIncreases in yield, duration or cumulative loss rate used in the valuation of level 3 trading cash instruments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 trading cash instrument, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.\n•\nTrading cash instruments are valued using discounted cash flows.\nLevel 3 Rollforward for Trading Cash Instruments\nThe table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for level 3 trading cash instruments.\nIn the table above:\n•\nChanges in fair value are presented for all trading cash instruments that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period.\n•\nNet unrealized gains/(losses) relates to trading cash instruments that were still held at period-end.\n•\nTransfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. If a trading cash instrument was transferred to level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3.\n•\nFor level 3 trading cash instrument assets, increases are shown as positive amounts, while decreases are shown as negative amounts. For level 3 trading cash instrument liabilities, increases are shown as negative amounts, while decreases are shown as positive amounts.\n•\nLevel 3 trading cash instruments are frequently economically hedged with level 1 and level 2 trading cash instruments and/or level 1, level 2 or level 3 derivatives. Accordingly, gains or losses that are classified in level 3 can be partially offset by gains or losses attributable to level 1 or level 2 trading cash instruments and/or level 1, level 2 or level 3 derivatives.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFair Value of Derivatives by Level\nThe table below presents derivatives on a gross basis by level and product type, as well as the impact of netting.\nIn the table above:\n•\nGross fair values exclude the effects of both counterparty netting and collateral netting, and therefore are not representative of the firm’s exposure.\n•\nCounterparty netting is reflected in each level to the extent that receivable and payable balances are netted within the same level and is included in counterparty netting in levels. Where the counterparty netting is across levels, the netting is included in cross-level counterparty netting.\n•\nDerivative assets are shown as positive amounts and derivative liabilities are shown as negative amounts.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of derivatives.\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs for Derivatives\nThe table below presents the amount of level 3 derivative assets (liabilities), and ranges, averages and medians of significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 derivatives.\nIn the table above:\n•\nDerivative assets are shown as positive amounts and derivative liabilities are shown as negative amounts.\n•\nRanges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of derivative.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nAverages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional amount of the respective financial instruments. An average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. For example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range.\n•\nThe ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives.\n•\nInterest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models.\n•\nThe fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, option pricing models and discounted cash flow models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques.\n•\nCorrelation within currencies and equities includes cross-product type correlation.\n•\nNatural gas spread represents the spread per million British thermal units of natural gas.\n•\nOil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products.\n•\nElectricity price represents the price per megawatt hour of electricity.\nRange of Significant Unobservable Inputs for Derivatives\nThe following provides information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm’s level 3 derivative instruments:\n•\nCorrelation.\nRanges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type.\n•\nVolatility.\nRanges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks.\n•\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.\nThe ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs.\n•\nCommodity prices and spreads.\nThe ranges for commodity prices and spreads cover variability in products, maturities and delivery locations.\nSensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs for Derivatives\nThe following is a description of the directional sensitivity of the firm’s level 3 fair value measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end:\n•\nCorrelation.\nIn general, for contracts where the holder benefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or index prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an increase in correlation results in a higher fair value measurement.\n•\nVolatility.\nIn general, for purchased options, an increase in volatility results in a higher fair value measurement.\n•\nCredit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.\nIn general, the fair value of purchased credit protection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit points increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related to distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the underlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic conditions.\n•\nCommodity prices and spreads.\nIn general, for contracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an increase in the spread (price difference from a benchmark index due to differences in quality or delivery location) or price results in a higher fair value measurement.\nDue to the distinctive nature of each of the firm’s level 3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

If a derivative was transferred into level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3.\n•\nPositive amounts for transfers into level 3 and negative amounts for transfers out of level 3 represent net transfers of derivative assets. Negative amounts for transfers into level 3 and positive amounts for transfers out of level 3 represent net transfers of derivative liabilities.\n•\nA derivative with level 1 and/or level 2 inputs is classified in level 3 in its entirety if it has at least one significant level 3 input.\n•\nIf there is one significant level 3 input, the entire gain or loss from adjusting only observable inputs (i.e., level 1 and level 2 inputs) is classified in level 3.\n•\nGains or losses that have been classified in level 3 resulting from changes in level 1 or level 2 inputs are frequently offset by gains or losses attributable to level 1 or level 2 derivatives and/or level 1, level 2 and level 3 trading cash instruments.

Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 investments.\n•\nIncreases in yield, discount rate, capitalization rate or duration used in the valuation of level 3 investments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 investment, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.\n•\nCorporate debt securities, securities backed by real estate and other debt obligations are valued using discounted cash flows, and equity securities are valued using market comparables and discounted cash flows.\n•\nThe fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows may be used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques.\n•\nThe significant unobservable inputs for recovery rate (related to securities backed by real estate) and for duration (related to other debt obligations) as of December 2022 did not have a range (and there was no weighted average) as each pertained to a single position.

These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP, and the related fair value gains and losses are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nThe table below presents a summary of trading assets and liabilities.\nSee Note 5 for further information about trading cash instruments and Note 7 for further information about derivatives.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGains and Losses from Market Making\nThe table below presents market making revenues by major product type.\nIn the table above:\n•\nGains/(losses) include both realized and unrealized gains and losses. Gains/(losses) exclude related interest income and interest expense. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\n•\nGains/(losses) included in market making are primarily related to the firm’s trading assets and liabilities, including both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.\n•\nGains/(losses) are not representative of the manner in which the firm manages its business activities because many of the firm’s market-making and client facilitation strategies utilize financial instruments across various product types. Accordingly, gains or losses in one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other product types. For example, most of the firm’s longer-term derivatives across product types are sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant portion of the firm’s trading cash instruments and derivatives across product types has exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged with foreign currency contracts.\nNote 7.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivative Activities\nDerivatives are instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm’s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC).\nMarket Making.\nAs a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making positions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand.\nRisk Management.\nThe firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and financing activities. The firm’s holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-by-instrument basis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits and certain U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale, foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale securities and the net investment in certain non-U.S. operations, and the price risk of certain commodities.\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including:\n•\nFutures and Forwards.\nContracts that commit counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future.\n•\nSwaps.\nContracts that require counterparties to exchange cash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices.\n•\nOptions.\nContracts in which the option purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price.\nDerivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in\ntrading assets\nand derivative liabilities are included in\ntrading liabilities\n.\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses\non derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Banking & Markets), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in Investment banking fees and Other within Global Banking & Markets, as well as derivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For both 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the firm’s derivatives were included in Global Banking & Markets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe tables below present the gross fair value and the notional amounts of derivative contracts by major product type, the amounts of counterparty and cash collateral netting in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as cash and securities collateral posted and received under enforceable credit support agreements that do not meet the criteria for netting under U.S. GAAP.\nIn the tables above:\n•\nGross fair values exclude the effects of both counterparty netting and collateral, and therefore are not representative of the firm’s exposure.\n•\nWhere the firm has received or posted collateral under credit support agreements, but has not yet determined such agreements are enforceable, the related collateral has not been netted.\n•\nNotional amounts, which represent the sum of gross long and short derivative contracts, provide an indication of the volume of the firm’s derivative activity and do not represent anticipated losses.\n•\nTotal gross fair value of derivatives included derivative assets of\n$\n10.08\nbillion\nas of December 2022 and $\n17.48\nbillion as of December 2021, a\nnd\nderivative liabilities of $\n12.71\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n17.29\nbillion as of December 2021, which are not subject to an enforceable netting agreement or are subject to a netting agreement that the firm has not yet determined to be enforceable.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOTC Derivatives\nThe table below presents OTC derivative assets and liabilities by tenor and major product type.\nIn the table above:\n•\nTenor is based on remaining contractual maturity.\n•\nCounterparty netting within the same product type and tenor category is included within such product type and tenor category.\n•\nCounterparty netting across product types within the same tenor category is included in counterparty netting in tenors. Where the counterparty netting is across tenor categories, the netting is included in cross-tenor counterparty netting.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of derivatives, and Note 5 for information about derivatives within the fair value hierarchy.\nCredit Derivatives\nThe firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and financing activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm’s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity.\nThe firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives:\n•\nCredit Default Swaps.\nSingle-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract.\n•\nCredit Options.\nIn a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nCredit Indices, Baskets and Tranches.\nCredit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction’s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche.\n•\nTotal Return Swaps.\nA total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation.\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm’s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default.\nAs of December 2022, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n528.31\nbillion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n579.14\nbillion, for total net notional purchased protection of $\n50.83\nbillion. As of December 2021, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n510.24\nbillion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n569.34\nbillion, for total net notional purchased protection of $\n59.10\nbillion. The firm’s written and purchased credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps.\nThe table below presents information about credit derivatives.\nIn the table above:\n•\nFair values exclude the effects of both netting of receivable balances with payable balances under enforceable netting agreements, and netting of cash received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements, and therefore are not representative of the firm’s credit exposure.\n•\nTenor is based on remaining contractual maturity.\n•\nThe credit spread on the underlier, together with the tenor of the contract, are indicators of payment/performance risk. The firm is less likely to pay or otherwise be required to perform where the credit spread and the tenor are lower.\n•\nOffsetting purchased credit derivatives represent the notional amount of purchased credit derivatives that economically hedge written credit derivatives with identical underliers.\n•\nOther purchased credit derivatives represent the notional amount of all other purchased credit derivatives not included in offsetting.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nImpact of Credit and Funding Spreads on Derivatives\nThe firm realizes gains or losses on its derivative contracts. These gains or losses include credit valuation adjustments (CVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets and liabilities, which represent the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in credit exposure, counterparty credit spreads, liability funding spreads (which include the firm’s own credit), probability of default and assumed recovery. These gains or losses also include funding valuation adjustments (FVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets, which represent the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in expected funding exposures and funding spreads.\nThe table below presents information about CVA and FVA.\nBifurcated Embedded Derivatives\nThe table below presents the fair value and the notional amount of derivatives that have been bifurcated from their related borrowings.\nIn the table above, derivatives that have been bifurcated from their related borrowings are recorded at fair value and primarily consist of interest rate, equity and commodity products. These derivatives are included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, as well as other secured financings, with the related borrowings.\nDerivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features\nCertain of the firm’s derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm’s credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency’s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies.\nThe table below presents information about net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements (excluding collateral posted), the fair value of collateral posted and additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in the firm’s credit ratings.\nHedge Accounting\nThe firm applies hedge accounting for (i) interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term borrowings, certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit and certain U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale, (ii) foreign currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale, (iii) foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign exchange risk on the firm’s net investment in certain non-U.S. operations and (iv) commodity futures contracts used to manage the price risk of certain commodities.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe firm designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit and, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, of certain U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or Overnight Index Swap Rate), effectively converting a substantial portion of these fixed-rate financial instruments into floating-rate financial instruments.\nThe firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of these hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor qualifying interest rate fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in interest income/expense. The change in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value (hedging adjustment) and is also included in interest income/expense. When a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge, any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortized in interest income/expense over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges and the related hedged items.\nThe table below presents the carrying value of investments, deposits and unsecured borrowings that are designated in an interest rate hedging relationship and the related cumulative hedging adjustment (increase/(decrease)) from current and prior hedging relationships included in such carrying values.\nIn the table above:\n•\nCumulative hedging adjustment included $\n5.09\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n5.91\nbillion as of December 2021 of hedging adjustments from prior hedging relationships that were de-designated and substantially all were related to unsecured long-term borrowings.\n•\nThe amortized cost of investments was\n$\n11.49\nbillion as of December 2022.\nIn addition, cumulative hedging adjustments for items no longer designated in a hedging relationship were $\n111\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n68\nmillion as of December 2021 and were substantially all related to unsecured long-term borrowings.\nThe firm designates foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk of non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale. See Note 8 for information about the amortized cost and fair value of such securities. The effectiveness of such hedges is assessed based on changes in spot rates. The gains/(losses) on the hedges (relating to both spot and forward points) and the foreign exchange gains/(losses) on the related available-for-sale securities are included in market making. The net gains/(losses) on hedges and related available-for-sale securities were $(\n30\n) million (reflecting a gain of $\n266\nmillion related to hedges and a loss of $\n296\nmillion on the related hedged available-for-sale securities) for 2022. The gross and net gains/(losses) were not material for both 2021 and 2020.\nThe firm designates commodity futures contracts as fair value hedges of the price risk of certain precious metals included in commodities within trading assets. As of December 2022, there were no such hedges outstanding, and as of December 2021, the carrying value of such commodities was $\n1.05\nbillion and the amortized cost was $\n1.02\nbillion. Changes in spot rates of such commodities are reflected as an adjustment to their carrying value, and the related gains/(losses) on both the commodities and the designated futures contracts are included in market making. The contractual forward points on the designated futures contracts are amortized into earnings ratably over the life of the contract and other gains/(losses) as a result of changes in the forward points are included in other comprehensive income/(loss). The cumulative hedging adjustment was not material as of both December 2022 and December 2021, and the related gains/(losses) were not material for both 2022 and 2021.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe firm seeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its net investments in certain non-U.S. operations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts (i.e., based on changes in forward rates). For foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on changes in spot rates. For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in currency translation.\nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from net investment hedging.\nGains or losses on individual net investments in non-U.S. operations are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to other principal transactions in the consolidated statements of earnings when such net investments are sold or substantially liquidated. The gross and net gains and losses on hedges and the related net investments in non-U.S. operations reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were\nnot\nmaterial for both 2022 and 2021, and $\n61\nmillion (reflecting a gain of $\n214\nmillion related to hedges and a loss of $\n153\nmillion on the related net investments in non-U.S. operations) for 2020.\nThe firm had designated $\n21.46\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n3.71\nbillion as of December 2021 of foreign currency-denominated debt, included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings, as hedges of net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nNote 8.\nInvestments\nInvestments includes debt instruments and equity securities that are accounted for at fair value and are generally held by the firm in connection with its long-term investing activities. In addition, investments includes debt securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity that are generally held in connection with the firm’s asset-liability management activities. Investments also consists of equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method.\nThe table below presents information about investments.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of investments, and Note 5 for information about investments within the fair value hierarchy.\nEquity Securities and Debt Instruments, at Fair Value\nEquity securities and debt instruments, at fair value are accounted for at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP, and the related fair value gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nEquity Securities, at Fair Value.\nEquity securities, at fair value consists of the firm’s public and private equity investments in corporate and real estate entities.\nThe table below presents information about equity securities, at fair value.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above:\n•\nEquity securities, at fair value included investments accounted for at fair value under the fair value option where the firm would otherwise apply the equity method of accounting of $\n5.35\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n5.81\nbillion as of December 2021. Gains/(losses) recognized as a result of changes in the fair value of equity securities for which the fair value option was elected were $(\n86\n) million for 2022 and $\n2.12\nbillion for 2021. These gains/(losses) are included in other principal transactions.\n•\nEquity securities, at fair value included $\n1.30\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.80\nbillion as of December 2021 of investments in funds that are measured at NAV.\nDebt Instruments, at Fair Value.\nDebt instruments, at fair value primarily includes mezzanine, senior and distressed debt.\nThe table below presents information about debt instruments, at fair value.\nIn the table above:\n•\nMoney market instruments primarily includes time deposits and investments in money market funds.\n•\nOther included $\n1.64\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.67\nbillion as of December 2021 of investments in credit funds that are measured at NAV.\nInvestments in Funds at Net Asset Value Per Share.\nEquity securities and debt instruments, at fair value include investments in funds that are measured at NAV of the investment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value.\nSubstantially all of the firm’s investments in funds at NAV consist of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-invests with third-party investors.\nPrivate equity funds primarily invest in a broad range of industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments and distressed investments. Credit funds generally invest in loans and other fixed income instruments and are focused on providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions, recapitalizations, financings, refinancings, acquisitions and restructurings for private equity firms, private family companies and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Private equity, credit and real estate funds are closed-end funds in which the firm’s investments are generally not eligible for redemption. Distributions will be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\nThe firm also invests in hedge funds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge funds that employ a fundamental bottom-up investment approach across various asset classes and strategies. The firm’s investments in hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature, and proceeds from redemptions will not be received until the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\nThe firm's investments in funds at NAV includes investments in “covered funds” as defined in the Volcker Rule of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). To achieve conformance with the covered fund provisions of the Volcker Rule by July 2022, the firm restructured certain legacy “illiquid funds” (as defined by the Volcker Rule) to be non-covered funds as liquidating trusts. However, based on recent interpretations of the covered fund provisions of the Volcker Rule, the firm was required to seek an additional extension from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) to bring these funds into conformance. The FRB granted the firm an additional extension to July 2023. If the firm does not conform such funds by July 2023, the firm will be required to sell such interests. If that occurs, the firm may receive a value for its interests that is less than the then carrying value as there could be a limited secondary market for these investments and the firm may be unable to sell them in orderly transactions. As of December 2022, the amount by which the firm’s investment in such funds would need to be reduced in order to achieve conformance was approximately $\n200\nmillion (net of the firm’s pro rata share of cash in the funds).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the fair value of investments in funds at NAV and the related unfunded commitments.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nAvailable-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value, and the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) unless designated in a fair value hedging relationship. See Note 7 for information about available-for-sale securities that are designated in a hedging relationship.\nThe table below presents information about available-for-sale securities by tenor.\nIn the table above:\n•\nAvailable-for-sale securities were classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n•\nThe weighted average yield for available-for-sale securities is presented on a pre-tax basis and computed using the effective interest rate of each security at the end of the period, weighted based on the fair value of each security.\n•\nThe gross unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were\nnot\nmaterial and the gross unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were $\n3.52\nbillion as of December 2022 and primarily related to U.S. government obligations in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than a year. The gross unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were $\n118\nmillion and the gross unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) were $\n779\nmillion as of December 2021 and primarily related to U.S. government obligations in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than a year. Net unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income/(loss) were $\n2.85\nbillion ($\n2.13\nbillion, net of tax) for 2022 and $\n1.28\nbillion ($\n955\nmillion, net of tax) for 2021.\n•\nIf the fair value of available-for-sale securities is less than amortized cost, such securities are considered impaired. If the firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, the difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and the fair value of the securities is recognized as an impairment loss in earnings. The firm did not record any such impairment losses during either 2022 or 2021. Impaired available-for-sale debt securities that the firm has the intent and ability to hold are reviewed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded. The firm considers various factors in such determination, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings and severity of the unrealized losses. The firm did not record any provision for credit losses on such securities during either 2022 or 2021.\nThe table below presents gross realized gains/(losses) and the proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities.\nIn the table above, the realized gains/(losses) were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to other principal transactions in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nHeld-to-Maturity Securities\nHeld-to-maturity securities are accounted for at amortized cost.\nThe table below presents information about held-to-maturity securities by type and tenor.\nIn the table above:\n•\nSubstantially all of the securities backed by real estate consist of securities backed by residential real estate.\n•\nAs these securities are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these securities been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, U.S. government obligations would have been classified in level 1 and securities backed by real estate would have been primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n•\nThe weighted average yield for held-to-maturity securities is presented on a pre-tax basis and computed using the effective interest rate of each security at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security.\n•\nThe gross unrealized gains were\nnot\nmaterial as of December 2022 and were $\n175\nmillion as of December 2021. The gross unrealized losses were $\n1.44\nbillion as of December 2022 and were\nnot\nmaterial as of December 2021.\n•\nHeld-to-maturity securities are reviewed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings. The firm considers various factors in such determination, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings, historical credit losses and sovereign guarantees. Provision for credit losses on such securities was not material during either 2022 or 2021.\nNote 9.\nLoans\nLoans includes (i) loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses or at fair value under the fair value option and (ii) loans held for sale that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. Interest on loans is recognized over the life of the loan and is recorded on an accrual basis.\nThe table below presents information about loans.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the firm changed the classification of loans to better reflect the nature of the underlying collateral. This includes the addition of the securities-based and other collateralized loan types, as well as the removal of the wealth management loan type. This also resulted in reclassifications of certain loans in the corporate and other loan types to the other collateralized loan type. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe increase in credit cards from December 2021 to December 2022 included approximately $\n2.0\nbillion relating to the firm’s acquisition of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio.\n•\nLoans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost include net deferred fees and costs, and unamortized premiums and discounts, which are amortized over the life of the loan. These amounts were less than 1% of loans accounted for at amortized cost as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nThe following is a description of the loan types in the table above:\n•\nCorporate.\nCorporate loans includes term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans are secured (typically by a senior lien on the assets of the borrower) or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors.\n•\nCommercial Real Estate.\nCommercial real estate loans includes originated loans that are directly or indirectly secured by hotels, retail stores, multifamily housing complexes and commercial and industrial properties. Commercial real estate loans also includes loans extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate. In addition, commercial real estate includes loans purchased by the firm.\n•\nResidential Real Estate.\nResidential real estate loans primarily includes loans extended to wealth management clients and to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate. In addition, residential real estate includes loans purchased by the firm.\n•\nSecurities-Based.\nSecurities-based loans includes loans that are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans are primarily extended to the firm's wealth management clients and used for purposes other than purchasing, carrying or trading margin stocks. Securities-based loans require borrowers to post additional collateral based on changes in the underlying collateral's fair value.\n•\nOther Collateralized.\nOther collateralized loans includes loans that are backed by specific collateral (other than securities and real estate). Such loans are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by corporate loans, consumer loans and other assets. Other collateralized loans also includes loans to investment funds (managed by third parties) that are collateralized by capital commitments of the funds' investors or assets held by the fund, as well as other secured loans extended to the firm's wealth management clients.\n•\nInstallment.\nInstallment loans are unsecured loans originated by the firm (including point-of-sale loans that the firm began to originate through the GreenSky platform in the third quarter of 2022).\n•\nCredit Cards.\nCredit card loans are loans made pursuant to revolving lines of credit issued to consumers by the firm.\n•\nOther.\nOther loans includes unsecured loans extended to wealth management clients and unsecured consumer and credit card loans purchased by the firm.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.\nCredit Quality\nRisk Assessment.\nThe firm’s risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans by the firm’s independent risk oversight and control function. For corporate loans and a majority of securities-based, real estate, other collateralized and other loans, the firm performs credit analyses which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations. These credit evaluations are performed on an annual basis or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. The firm determines an internal credit rating for the borrower by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower’s industry and the economic environment. The internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements. For consumer loans and for loans that are not assigned an internal credit rating, the firm reviews certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, collateral value and other risk factors.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents gross loans by an internally determined public rating agency equivalent or other credit metrics and the concentration of secured and unsecured loans.\nIn the table above:\n•\nSubstantially all residential real estate, securities-based, other collateralized and other loans included in the other metrics/unrated category consists of loans where the firm uses other key metrics to assess the borrower’s credit quality, such as loan-to-value ratio, delinquency status, collateral value, expected cash flows, FICO credit score (which measures a borrower’s creditworthiness by considering factors such as payment and credit history) and other risk factors.\n•\nFor installment and credit card loans included in the other metrics/unrated category, the evaluation of credit quality incorporates the borrower’s FICO credit score. FICO credit scores are periodically refreshed by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. See “Vintage” below for information about installment and credit card loans by FICO credit scores.\nThe firm also assigns a regulatory risk rating to its loans based on the definitions provided by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. Total loans included\n93\n% of loans as of December 2022 and\n92\n% of loans as of December 2021 that were rated pass/non-criticized.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

At that time, all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. A loan is considered past due when a principal or interest payment has not been made according to its contractual terms. Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and accrue interest until the loan is paid in full or is charged off.\nIn certain circumstances, the firm may modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, typically in the form of a modification of loan covenants, but may also include forbearance of interest or principal, payment extensions or interest rate reductions. These modifications, to the extent significant, are considered TDRs. Loan modifications that extend payment terms for a period of less than 90 days are generally considered insignificant and therefore not reported as TDRs.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about past due loans.\nThe table below presents information about nonaccrual loans.\nIn the table above:\n•\nNonaccrual loans included $\n483\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n254\nmillion as of December 2021 of loans that were 30 days or more past due.\n•\nLoans that were 90 days or more past due and still accruing were not material as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n•\nNonaccrual loans included $\n204\nmillion of corporate loans as of December 2022 and $\n267\nmillion of corporate and commercial real estate loans as of December 2021 that were modified in a TDR. The firm’s lending commitments related to these loans were not material as of both December 2022 and December 2021. Installment loans that were modified in a TDR were not material\nas of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n•\nAllowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonaccrual loans was\n204.5\n% as of December 2022 and\n144.7\n% as of December 2021.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe firm’s allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost. Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance for credit losses.\nTo determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm classifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which the firm has developed and documented its methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loan and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios described below. The firm applies judgment in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including the firm’s internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends.\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagement’s estimate of credit losses entails judgment about the expected life of the loan and loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within the firm’s independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within the firm’s independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While management uses the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used.\nThe table below presents gross loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost by portfolio.\nIn the table above:\n•\nWholesale loans included $\n2.67\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n2.43\nbillion as of December 2021 of nonaccrual loans for which the allowance for credit losses was measured on an asset-specific basis. The allowance for credit losses on these loans was $\n535\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n543\nmillion as of December 2021. These loans included $\n384\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n140\nmillion as of December 2021 of loans which did not require a reserve as the loan was deemed to be recoverable.\n•\nCredit card lending commitments included $\n62.22\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n33.97\nbillion as of December 2021 related to credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. The increase in credit card lending commitments from December 2021 to December 2022 reflected approximately $\n15.0\nbillion relating to the firm’s acquisition of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio. In addition, credit card lending commitments as of December 2021 included a commitment of approximately $\n2.0\nbillion to acquire the outstanding credit card loans related to the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\n•\nThe increase in installment lending commitments from December 2021 to December 2022 primarily relates to commitments extended in connection with point-of-sale financing through GreenSky. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\nThe following is a description of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses:\nWholesale.\nThe allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans and lending commitments that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers the probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans and lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or loans in a TDR, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral.\nWholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nConsumer.\nThe allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool’s risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit risk measurement and management and include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans include unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The expected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm also recognizes an allowance for credit losses on commitments to acquire loans and commitments extended in connection with point-of-sale financing. However, no allowance for credit losses is recognized on credit card lending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm.\nThe allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as loans in a TDR, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate.\nInstallment loans are charged off when they are 120 days past due. Credit card loans are charged off when they are 180 days past due.\nAllowance for Credit Losses Rollforward\nThe table below presents information about the allowance for credit losses.\nIn the table above:\n•\nFor the year ended December 2021, other primarily represented the reduction to the allowance related to loans and lending commitments transferred to held for sale.\n•\nThe allowance ratio is calculated by dividing the allowance for loan losses by gross loans accounted for at amortized cost.\n•\nThe net charge-off ratio is calculated by dividing net (charge-offs)/recoveries by average gross loans accounted for at amortized cost.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nForecast Model Inputs as of December 2022\nWhen modeling expected credit losses, the firm employs a weighted, multi-scenario forecast, which includes baseline, adverse and favorable economic scenarios. As of December 2022, this multi-scenario forecast was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios.\nThe table below presents the forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates used in the baseline economic scenario of the forecast model.\nThe adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in 2023 and a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. In this scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate peaks at approximately\n7.4\n% during the first quarter of 2024 and the maximum decline in the quarterly U.S. GDP relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 is approximately\n2.7\n%, which occurs during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIn the table above:\n•\nU.S. unemployment rate represents the rate forecasted as of the respective quarter-end.\n•\nGrowth in U.S. GDP represents the year-over-year growth rate forecasted for the respective years.\n•\nWhile the U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates are significant inputs to the forecast model, the model contemplates a variety of other inputs across a range of scenarios to provide a forecast of future economic conditions. Given the complex nature of the forecasting process, no single economic variable can be viewed in isolation and independently of other inputs.\nAllowance for Credit Losses Commentary\nYear Ended December 2022.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $\n1.97\nbillion during 2022, reflecting growth in the firm's consumer lending portfolios (principally in credit cards) and higher modeled expected losses due to broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. In addition, the allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans was impacted by asset-specific provisions and ratings downgrades primarily related to borrowers in the technology, media & telecommunications, real estate, and consumer & retail industries.\nNet (charge-offs)/recoveries for 2022 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net (charge-offs)/recoveries for consumer loans were primarily related to credit cards.\nYear Ended December 2021.\nThe allowance for credit losses decreased by $\n82\nmillion during 2021, reflecting reserve reduction driven by improved broader economic environment, partially offset by growth in the firm’s lending portfolios, primarily in the consumer portfolio related to credit cards, including a provision for credit losses of approximately $\n185\nmillion related to the acquisition of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio.\nNet (charge-offs)/recoveries for 2021 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net (charge-offs)/recoveries for consumer loans were primarily related to credit cards.\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASC 326)\nThe firm adopted ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" as of January 1, 2020. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm's allowance for credit losses on financial assets and commitments that are accounted for at amortized cost reflects management's estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of such assets. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020, was a decrease to retained earnings of $\n638\nmillion (net of tax).\nEstimated Fair Value\nThe table below presents the estimated fair value of loans that are not accounted for at fair value and in what level of the fair value hierarchy they would have been classified if they had been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 10.\nFair Value Option\nOther Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value\nIn addition to trading assets and liabilities, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all under the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to:\n•\nReflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis;\n•\nMitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and\n•\nAddress simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts).\nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm does not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nOther financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include:\n•\nResale and repurchase agreements;\n•\nCertain securities borrowed and loaned transactions;\n•\nCertain customer and other receivables and certain other assets and liabilities;\n•\nCertain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments;\n•\nSubstantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; and\n•\nCertain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities, and Note 5 for information about other financial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.\nGains and Losses on Other Financial Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value Under the Fair Value Option\nThe table below presents the gains and losses recognized in earnings as a result of the election to apply the fair value option to certain financial assets and liabilities.\nIn the table above:\n•\nGains/(losses) were substantially all included in market making.\n•\nGains/(losses) exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense, for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\n•\nGains/(losses) included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings were substantially all related to the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments. These gains and losses would have been recognized under other U.S. GAAP even if the firm had not elected to account for the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value.\n•\nGains/(losses) included in other were substantially all related to resale and repurchase agreements, deposits, other secured financings and other liabilities.\n•\nOther financial assets and liabilities at fair value are frequently economically hedged with trading assets and liabilities. Accordingly, gains or losses on such other financial assets and liabilities can be partially offset by gains or losses on trading assets and liabilities. As a result, gains or losses on other financial assets and liabilities do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm’s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nSee Note 8 for information about gains/(losses) on equity securities and Note 9 for information about gains/(losses) on loans which are accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Gains/(losses) on trading assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are included in market making. See Note 6 for further information about gains/(losses) from market making.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLong-Term Debt Instruments\nThe difference between the aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of long-term other secured financings, for which the fair value option was elected, was\nnot\nmaterial as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nThe aggregate contractual principal amount of unsecured long-term borrowings, for which the fair value option was elected, exceeded the related fair value by $\n5.03\nbillion as of December 2022. The related amount was\nnot\nmaterial as of December 2021.\nThese debt instruments include both principal-protected and non-principal-protected long-term borrowings.\nDebt Valuation Adjustment\nThe firm calculates the fair value of financial liabilities for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the firm’s credit spreads.\nThe table below presents information about the net debt valuation adjustment (DVA) gains/(losses) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.\nIn the table above:\n•\nAfter-tax DVA is included in debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n•\nThe gains/(losses) reclassified to market making in the consolidated statements of earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) upon extinguishment of such financial liabilities were not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nLoans and Lending Commitments\nThe table below presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate contractual principal amount for loans (included in trading assets and loans in the consolidated balance sheets) for which the fair value option was elected.\nIn the table above, the aggregate contractual principal amount of loans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due (which excludes loans carried at zero fair value and considered uncollectible) exceeds the related fair value primarily because the firm regularly purchases loans, such as distressed loans, at values significantly below the contractual principal amounts.\nThe fair value of unfunded lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was a liability of $\n22\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n20\nmillion as of December 2021, and the related total contractual amount of these lending commitments was $\n307\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n611\nmillion as of December 2021. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\nImpact of Credit Spreads on Loans and Lending Commitments\nThe estimated net gain/(loss) attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $(\n281\n) million for 2022, $\n277\nmillion for 2021 and $(\n106\n) million for 2020.\nThe firm generally calculates the fair value of loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the instrument-specific credit spreads. For floating-rate loans and lending commitments, substantially all changes in fair value are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans and lending commitments, changes in fair value are also attributable to changes in interest rates.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 11.\nCollateralized Agreements and Financings\nCollateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements\nA resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including “repos- and reverses-to-maturity”) involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations.\nThe firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions\nIn a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\nThe firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction.\nSecurities borrowed and loaned within FICC financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value.\nSubstantially all of the securities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these agreements been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOffsetting Arrangements\nThe table below presents resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions included in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as the amounts not offset in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the table above:\n•\nSubstantially all of the gross carrying values of these arrangements are subject to enforceable netting agreements.\n•\nWhere the firm has received or posted collateral under credit support agreements, but has not yet determined such agreements are enforceable, the related collateral has not been netted.\n•\nAmounts not offset includes counterparty netting that does not meet the criteria for netting under U.S. GAAP and the fair value of collateral received or posted subject to enforceable credit support agreements.\n•\nResale agreements and repurchase agreements are carried at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 4 for further information about the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine fair value.\n•\nSecurities borrowed included in the consolidated balance sheets of $\n38.58\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n39.96\nbillion as of December 2021, and securities loaned of $\n4.37\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n9.17\nbillion as of December 2021 were at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 for further information about securities borrowed and securities loaned accounted for at fair value.\nGross Carrying Value of Repurchase Agreements and Securities Loaned\nThe table below presents the gross carrying value of repurchase agreements and securities loaned by class of collateral pledged.\nThe table below presents the gross carrying value of repurchase agreements and securities loaned by maturity.\nIn the table above:\n•\nRepurchase agreements and securities loaned that are repayable prior to maturity at the option of the firm are reflected at their contractual maturity dates.\n•\nRepurchase agreements and securities loaned that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are reflected at the earliest dates such options become exercisable.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOther Secured Financings\nIn addition to repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, the firm funds certain assets through the use of other secured financings and pledges financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these transactions. These other secured financings include:\n•\nLiabilities of consolidated VIEs;\n•\nTransfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than sales (e.g., pledged commodities, bank loans and mortgage whole loans); and\n•\nOther structured financing arrangements.\nOther secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $\n7.94\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n8.64\nbillion as of December 2021.\nThe firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates non-economic volatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 10 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value.\nOther secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these financings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 3 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nThe table below presents information about other secured financings.\nIn the table above:\n•\nShort-term other secured financings includes financings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and financings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder.\n•\nU.S. dollar-denominated short-term other secured financings at amortized cost had a weighted average interest rate of\n5.56\n% as of December 2022. These rates include the effect of hedging activities.\n•\nNon-U.S. dollar-denominated short-term other secured financings at amortized cost had a weighted average interest rate of\n0.22\n% as of December 2021. This rate includes the effect of hedging activities.\n•\nU.S. dollar-denominated long-term other secured financings at amortized cost had a weighted average interest rate of\n3.54\n% as of December 2022 and\n1.06\n% as of December 2021. These rates include the effect of hedging activities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nNon-U.S. dollar-denominated long-term other secured financings at amortized cost had a weighted average interest rate of\n0.45\n% as of December 2022 and\n0.46\n% as of December 2021. These rates include the effect of hedging activities.\n•\nTotal other secured financings included $\n1.69\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.97\nbillion as of December 2021 related to transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings rather than sales. Such financings were collateralized by financial assets, primarily included in trading assets, of $\n1.64\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n2.02\nbillion as of December 2021.\n•\nOther secured financings collateralized by financial instruments included $\n7.49\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n10.37\nbillion as of December 2021 of other secured financings collateralized by trading assets, investments and loans, and included $\n1.22\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n2.45\nbillion as of December 2021 of other secured financings collateralized by financial instruments received as collateral and repledged.\nThe table below presents other secured financings by maturity.\nIn the table above:\n•\nLong-term other secured financings that are repayable prior to maturity at the option of the firm are reflected at their contractual maturity dates.\n•\nLong-term other secured financings that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are reflected at the earliest dates such options become exercisable.\nCollateral Received and Pledged\nThe firm receives cash and securities (e.g., U.S. government and agency obligations, other sovereign and corporate obligations, as well as equity securities) as collateral, primarily in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative transactions and customer margin loans. The firm obtains cash and securities as collateral on an upfront or contingent basis for derivative instruments and collateralized agreements to reduce its credit exposure to individual counterparties.\nIn many cases, the firm is permitted to deliver or repledge financial instruments received as collateral when entering into repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, primarily in connection with secured client financing activities. The firm is also permitted to deliver or repledge these financial instruments in connection with other secured financings, collateralized derivative transactions and firm or customer settlement requirements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm also pledges certain trading assets in connection with repurchase agreements, securities loaned transactions and other secured financings, and other assets (substantially all real estate and cash) in connection with other secured financings to counterparties who may or may not have the right to deliver or repledge them.\nThe table below presents financial instruments at fair value received as collateral that were available to be delivered or repledged and were delivered or repledged.\nThe table below presents information about assets pledged.\nThe firm also segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Such securities are segregated from trading assets and investments, as well as from securities received as collateral under resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions. Securities segregated by the firm were $\n49.60\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n41.49\nbillion as of December 2021.\nNote 12.\nOther Assets\nThe table below presents other assets by type.\nDuring 2022, the firm completed the acquisitions of (i) GreenSky, a leading technology company facilitating point-of-sale financing for merchants and consumers, in an all-stock transaction, (ii) NN Investment Partners (NNIP), a leading European asset manager, in an all-cash transaction, and (iii) NextCapital Group, Inc. (NextCapital), a digital retirement advice provider, in an all-cash transaction. These acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and had an aggregate purchase price of $\n3.83\nbillion, substantially all of which related to GreenSky and NNIP. The purchase price of GreenSky has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill of approximately $\n1.05\nbillion, identifiable intangible assets of approximately $\n710\nmillion and tangible assets of approximately $\n960\nmillion (primarily cash and other assets), and to liabilities assumed of approximately $\n990\nmillion (primarily unsecured short-term borrowings and customer and other payables). The purchase price of NNIP has been preliminarily allocated to goodwill of approximately $\n880\nmillion, identifiable intangible assets of approximately $\n900\nmillion, tangible assets of approximately $\n540\nmillion (primarily cash and customer and other receivables), and to liabilities assumed of approximately $\n500\nmillion (primarily deferred tax liabilities and customer and other payables). See below for further information about goodwill and identifiable intangible assets related to these acquisitions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nProperty, Leasehold Improvements and Equipment\nProperty, leasehold improvements and equipment is net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $\n12.19\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n10.81\nbillion as of December 2021. Property, leasehold improvements and equipment included $\n7.17\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n6.71\nbillion as of December 2021 that the firm uses in connection with its operations, and $\n89\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n194\nmillion as of December 2021 of foreclosed real estate primarily related to distressed loans that were purchased by the firm. The remainder is held by investment entities, including VIEs, consolidated by the firm.\nSubstantially all property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. Capitalized costs of software developed or obtained for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthree years\n.\nThe firm tests property, leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\nThe firm had impairments of $\n314\nmillion during 2022, $\n143\nmillion during 2021, and $\n171\nmillion during 2020, primarily related to properties held by the firm’s investment entities within Asset & Wealth Management.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the changes to the firm’s business segments, the firm reassigned the goodwill to its new reporting units using a relative fair value approach in accordance with ASC 350.\nThe table below presents the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit.\nIn the table above:\n•\nGoodwill of $\n14\nmillion previously in Investment Banking was reassigned to the Transaction banking and other reporting unit related to the transfer of the transaction banking business. The amount of goodwill reassigned was based on the relative fair values of the transferred business and the remaining business within Investment Banking.\n•\nGoodwill of $\n9\nmillion previously in Wealth management was reassigned to the Equities reporting unit related to the transfer of a securities-based loans business of the firm. The amount of goodwill reassigned was based on the relative fair values of the transferred business and the remaining business within Wealth management.\n•\nAll goodwill previously in Consumer banking was reassigned to Wealth management and Consumer platforms based on the relative fair values of the businesses transferred to each reporting unit.\n•\nGoodwill previously in FICC, Equities and Asset Management was not reassigned as no businesses were transferred out of these reporting units.\n•\nSubstantially all of the increase in goodwill from December 2021 to December 2022 was driven by the acquisitions of GreenSky and NNIP.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, goodwill was tested for impairment using a quantitative test (both prior to and following the firm’s changes to its business segments). For each test, the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value, and therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nThe estimated fair value of each reporting unit was based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use to value these reporting units. Estimated fair values are generally derived from utilizing a relative value technique, which applies observable price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-book multiples of comparable competitors to the reporting units’ net earnings or net book value, or a discounted cash flow valuation approach, for reporting units with businesses in early stages of development. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nThe table below presents identifiable intangible assets by type.\nThe firm acquired approximately $\n1.79\nbillion of identifiable intangible assets (with a weighted average amortization period of\n13\nyears) during 2022, substantially all in connection with the acquisitions of GreenSky and NNIP. Substantially all of these identifiable intangible assets consisted of customer lists and merchant relationships. During 2021, the amount of identifiable intangible assets acquired by the firm was not material.\nSubstantially all of the firm’s identifiable intangible assets have finite useful lives and are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method.\nThe tables below present information about the amortization of identifiable intangible assets.\nThe firm tests identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\nThere were no material impairments during 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Assets\nThe firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. For leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment.\nAn operating lease right-of-use asset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term.\nRight-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities recognized (in non-cash transactions for leases entered into or assumed) by the firm were $\n256\nmillion for 2022, $\n305\nmillion for 2021 and $\n182\nmillion for 2020. See Note 15 for information about operating lease liabilities.\nFor leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit from leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has shortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, the firm will record an impairment or accelerated amortization of right-of-use assets.\nThere were no material impairments or accelerated amortizations during 2022 and 2021.\nMiscellaneous Receivables and Other\nMiscellaneous receivables and other included:\n•\nInvestments in qualified affordable housing projects of $\n793\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n714\nmillion as of December 2021.\n•\nAssets classified as held for sale of $\n285\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.02\nbillion as of December 2021 related to certain of the firm’s consolidated investments within Asset & Wealth Management, primarily consisted of property and equipment.\nNote 13.\nDeposits\nThe table below presents the types and sources of deposits.\nIn the table above:\n•\nSubstantially all deposits are interest-bearing.\n•\nSavings and demand accounts consist of money market deposit accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts and demand deposit accounts that have no stated maturity or expiration date.\n•\nTime deposits included $\n15.75\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n35.43\nbillion as of December 2021 of deposits accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about deposits accounted for at fair value.\n•\nTime deposits had a weighted average maturity of approximately\n0.9\nyears as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n•\nDeposit sweep programs include long-term contractual agreements with U.S. broker-dealers who sweep client cash to FDIC-insured deposits.\n•\nTransaction banking deposits consists of deposits that the firm raised through its cash management services business for corporate and other institutional clients.\n•\nOther deposits represent deposits from institutional clients.\n•\nDeposits insured by the FDIC were $\n184.88\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n156.66\nbillion as of December 2021.\n•\nDeposits insured by non-U.S. insurance programs were $\n31.74\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n31.44\nbillion as of December 2021.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the location of deposits.\nIn the table above, U.S. deposits were held at Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) and substantially all non-U.S. deposits were held at Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB) and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE).\nThe table below presents maturities of time deposits held in U.S. and non-U.S. offices.\nAs of December 2022, deposits in U.S. offices included $\n14.81\nbillion and deposits in non-U.S. offices included $\n18.96\nbillion of time deposits in denominations that met or exceeded the applicable insurance limits, or were otherwise not covered by insurance.\nThe firm’s savings and demand deposits are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest\n, which approximates fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its time deposits not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of time deposits not accounted for at fair value approximated fair value as of both December 2022 and December 2021. As these savings and demand deposits and time deposits are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these deposits been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nNote 14.\nUnsecured Borrowings\nThe table below presents information about unsecured borrowings.\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings\nUnsecured short-term borrowings includes the portion of unsecured long-term borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and unsecured long-term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder.\nThe firm accounts for certain hybrid financial instruments at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about unsecured short-term borrowings that are accounted for at fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its unsecured short-term borrowings not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of unsecured short-term borrowings that are not recorded at fair value generally approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the obligations. As these unsecured short-term borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5.\nHad these borrowings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nThe table below presents information about unsecured short-term borrowings.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe current portion of unsecured long-term borrowings included $\n21.75\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n9.16\nbillion as of December 2021 issued by Group Inc.\n•\nThe weighted average interest rates for these borrowings include the effect of hedging activities and exclude unsecured short-term borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 7 for further information about hedging activities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nUnsecured Long-Term Borrowings\nThe table below presents information about unsecured long-term borrowings.\nIn the table above:\n•\nUnsecured long-term borrowings consists principally of senior borrowings, which have maturities extending through\n2065\n.\n•\nFloating-rate obligations includes equity-linked, credit-linked and indexed instruments. Floating interest rates are generally based on Euro Interbank Offered Rate, SOFR or USD LIBOR.\n•\nU.S. dollar-denominated debt had interest rates ranging from\n0.66\n% to\n6.75\n% (with a weighted average rate of\n3.51\n%) as of December 2022 and\n0.48\n% to\n7.68\n% (with a weighted average rate of\n3.34\n%) as of December 2021. These rates exclude unsecured long-term borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\n•\nNon-U.S. dollar-denominated debt had interest rates ranging from\n0.13\n% to\n7.25\n% (with a weighted average rate of\n1.85\n%) as of December 2022 and\n0.13\n% to\n13.00\n% (with a weighted average rate of\n1.86\n%) as of December 2021. These rates exclude unsecured long-term borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nThe table below presents unsecured long-term borrowings by maturity.\nIn the table above:\n•\nUnsecured long-term borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and unsecured long-term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder are excluded as they are included in unsecured short-term borrowings.\n•\nUnsecured long-term borrowings that are repayable prior to maturity at the option of the firm are reflected at their contractual maturity dates.\n•\nUnsecured long-term borrowings that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are reflected at the earliest dates such options become exercisable.\n•\nUnsecured long-term borrowings included $(\n15.01\n) billion of adjustments to the carrying value of certain unsecured long-term borrowings resulting from the application of hedge accounting by year of maturity as follows: $(\n539\n) million in 2024, $(\n1.25\n) billion in 2025, $(\n800\n) million in 2026, $(\n1.55\n) billion in 2027 and $(\n10.87\n) billion in 2028 and thereafter.\nThe firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of fixed-rate unsecured long-term borrowings not accounted for at fair value into floating-rate obligations. See Note 7 for further information about hedging activities.\nThe table below presents unsecured long-term borrowings, after giving effect to such hedging activities.\nIn the table above, the aggregate amounts of unsecured long-term borrowings had weighted average interest rates of\n4.97\n% (\n4.08\n% related to fixed-rate obligations and\n5.00\n% related to floating-rate obligations) as of December 2022 and\n1.60\n% (\n2.25\n% related to fixed-rate obligations and\n1.48\n% related to floating-rate obligations) as of December 2021. These rates exclude unsecured long-term borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe carrying value of unsecured long-term borrowings for which the firm did not elect the fair value option was $\n173.99\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n201.70\nbillion as of December 2021. The estimated fair value of such unsecured long-term borrowings was $\n173.70\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n209.37\nbillion as of December 2021. As these borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these borrowings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nSubordinated Borrowings\nUnsecured long-term borrowings includes subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Subordinated debt that matures within one year is included in unsecured short-term borrowings. Junior subordinated debt is junior in right of payment to other subordinated borrowings, which are junior to senior borrowings.\nLong-term subordinated debt had maturities ranging from\n2025\nto\n2045\nas of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nThe table below presents information about subordinated borrowings.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe par amount of subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. was $\n12.26\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n12.44\nbillion as of December 2021, and the carrying value of subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. was $\n11.88\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n15.57\nbillion as of December 2021.\n•\nThe rate is the weighted average interest rate for these borrowings (excluding borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option), including the effect of fair value hedges used to convert fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. See Note 7 for further information about hedging activities.\nJunior Subordinated Debt\nIn 2004, Group Inc. issued $\n2.84\nbillion of junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital I, a Delaware statutory trust. Goldman Sachs Capital I issued $\n2.75\nbillion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $\n85\nmillion of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $\n968\nmillion and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $\n939\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion, respectively. Goldman Sachs Capital I is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes.\nThe firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of\n6.345\n% and the debt matures on\nFebruary 15, 2034\n. The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on Goldman Sachs Capital I’s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. Goldman Sachs Capital I is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full.\nNote 15.\nOther Liabilities\nThe table below presents other liabilities by type.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOperating Lease Liabilities\nFor leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. See Note 12 for information about operating lease right-of-use assets.\nThe table below presents information about operating lease liabilities.\nIn the table above, the weighted average discount rate represents the firm’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 2019 for operating leases existing on the date of adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” and at the lease inception date for leases entered into subsequent to the adoption of this ASU.\nOperating lease costs were $\n462\nmillion for 2022, $\n463\nmillion for 2021 and $\n458\nmillion for 2020. Variable lease costs, which are included in operating lease costs, were not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Total occupancy expenses for space held in excess of the firm’s current requirements were not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nLease payments relating to operating lease arrangements that were signed but had not yet commenced were $\n1.48\nbillion as of December 2022.\nAccrued Expenses and Other\nAccrued expenses and other included:\n•\nLiabilities classified as held for sale were\nnot\nmaterial as of December 2022 and $\n310\nmillion as of December 2021 related to certain of the firm’s consolidated investments within Asset & Wealth Management, substantially all of which consisted of other secured financings primarily carried at fair value under the fair value option, and were related to assets classified as held for sale. See Note 12 for further information about assets held for sale.\n•\nContract liabilities, which represent consideration received by the firm in connection with its contracts with clients prior to providing the service, were $\n113\nmillion as of December 2022 and were\nnot\nmaterial as of December 2021.\nNote 16.\nSecuritization Activities\nThe firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by selling these assets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and limited liability companies) or through a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm’s residential mortgage securitizations are primarily in connection with government agency securitizations.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the transferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors.\nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities.\nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm’s continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm’s investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. Interests accounted for at fair value are primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\nThe table below presents the amount of financial assets securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in securitization entities in which the firm had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.\nThe firm securitized assets of $\n792\nmillion during 2022, $\n886\nmillion during 2021 and $\n551\nmillion during 2020, in a non-cash exchange for loans and investments.\nThe table below presents information about nonconsolidated securitization entities to which the firm sold assets and had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.\nIn the table above:\n•\nCMOs represents collateralized mortgage obligations.\n•\nThe outstanding principal amount is presented for the purpose of providing information about the size of the securitization entities and is not representative of the firm’s risk of loss.\n•\nThe firm’s risk of loss from retained or purchased interests is limited to the carrying value of these interests.\n•\nPurchased interests represent senior and subordinated interests, purchased in connection with secondary market-making activities, in securitization entities in which the firm also holds retained interests.\n•\nSubstantially all of the total outstanding principal amount and total retained interests relate to securitizations during 2018 and thereafter.\n•\nThe fair value of retained interests was $\n5.03\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n3.57\nbillion as of December 2021.\nIn addition to the interests in the table above, the firm had other continuing involvement in the form of derivative transactions and commitments with certain nonconsolidated VIEs. The carrying value of these derivatives and commitments was a net asset of $\n72\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n81\nmillion as of December 2021, and the notional amount of these derivatives and commitments was $\n1.90\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.81\nbillion as of December 2021. The notional amounts of these derivatives and commitments are included in maximum exposure to loss in the nonconsolidated VIE table in Note 17.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about the weighted average key economic assumptions used in measuring the fair value of mortgage-backed retained interests.\nIn the table above:\n•\nAmounts do not reflect the benefit of other financial instruments that are held to mitigate risks inherent in these retained interests.\n•\nChanges in fair value based on an adverse variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value is not usually linear.\n•\nThe impact of a change in a particular assumption is calculated independently of changes in any other assumption. In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions might magnify or counteract the sensitivities disclosed above.\n•\nThe constant prepayment rate is included only for positions for which it is a key assumption in the determination of fair value.\n•\nThe discount rate for retained interests that relate to U.S. government agency-issued CMOs does not include any credit loss. Expected credit loss assumptions are reflected in the discount rate for the remainder of retained interests.\nThe firm has other retained interests not reflected in the table above with a fair value of $\n384\nmillion and a weighted average life of\n6.4\nyears as of December 2022, and a fair value of $\n360\nmillion and a weighted average life of\n3.6\nyears as of December 2021. Due to the nature and fair value of certain of these retained interests, the weighted average assumptions for constant prepayment and discount rates and the related sensitivity to adverse changes are not meaningful as of both December 2022 and December 2021. The firm’s maximum exposure to adverse changes in the value of these interests is the carrying value of $\n398\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n360\nmillion as of December 2021.\nNote 17.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE’s expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE’s expected residual returns.\nThe firm’s variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk.\nVIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm’s involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm’s consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE.\nVIE Consolidation Analysis\nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers:\n•\nWhich variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance;\n•\nWhich variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE;\n•\nThe VIE’s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders;\n•\nThe VIE’s capital structure;\n•\nThe terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties involved with the VIE; and\n•\nRelated-party relationships.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances.\nVIE Activities\nThe firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following business activities:\nMortgage-Backed VIEs.\nThe firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs.\nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs.\nThe firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the total return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures.\nPrincipal-Protected Note VIEs.\nThe firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. The firm also obtains funding through these VIEs.\nInvestments in Funds.\nThe firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm has generally not sold assets to, or entered into derivatives with, these VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the nonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds variable interests.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe nature of the firm’s variable interests is described in the rows under maximum exposure to loss.\n•\nThe firm’s exposure to the obligations of VIEs is generally limited to its interests in these entities. In certain instances, the firm provides guarantees, including derivative guarantees, to VIEs or holders of variable interests in VIEs.\n•\nThe maximum exposure to loss excludes the benefit of offsetting financial instruments that are held to mitigate the risks associated with these variable interests.\n•\nThe maximum exposure to loss from retained interests, purchased interests, and debt and equity is the carrying value of these interests.\n•\nThe maximum exposure to loss from commitments and guarantees, and derivatives is the notional amount, which does not represent anticipated losses and has not been reduced by unrealized losses. As a result, the maximum exposure to loss exceeds liabilities recorded for commitments and guarantees, and derivatives.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information, by principal business activity, for nonconsolidated VIEs included in the summary table above.\nAs of both December 2022 and December 2021, the carrying values of the firm’s variable interests in nonconsolidated VIEs are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\n•\nMortgage-backed: Assets primarily included in trading assets and loans.\n•\nReal estate, credit- and power-related and other investing: Assets primarily included in investments and loans, and liabilities included in trading liabilities and other liabilities.\n•\nCorporate debt and other asset-backed: Assets included in loans and trading assets, and liabilities included in trading liabilities.\n•\nInvestments in funds: Assets included in investments.\nConsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the carrying value and balance sheet classification of assets and liabilities in consolidated VIEs.\nIn the table above:\n•\nAssets and liabilities are presented net of intercompany eliminations and exclude the benefit of offsetting financial instruments that are held to mitigate the risks associated with the firm’s variable interests.\n•\nVIEs in which the firm holds a majority voting interest are excluded if (i) the VIE meets the definition of a business and (ii) the VIE’s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of its obligations.\n•\nSubstantially all assets can only be used to settle obligations of the VIE.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information, by principal business activity, for consolidated VIEs included in the summary table above.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe majority of the assets in principal-protected notes VIEs are intercompany and are eliminated in consolidation.\n•\nCreditors and beneficial interest holders of real estate, credit-related and other investing VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the firm.\nNote 18.\nCommitments,\nContingencies\nand\nGuarantees\nCommitments\nThe table below presents commitments by type.\nThe table below presents commitments by expiration.\nLending Commitments\nThe firm’s commercial and warehouse financing lending commitments are agreements to lend with fixed termination dates and depend on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to borrowing. These commitments are presented net of amounts syndicated to third parties. The total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect actual future cash flows because the firm may syndicate portions of these commitments. In addition, commitments can expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty’s request. The firm also provides credit to consumers by issuing credit card lines and through commitments to provide unsecured installment loans.\nThe table below presents information about lending commitments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above:\n•\nHeld for investment lending commitments are accounted for at amortized cost. The carrying value of lending commitments was a liability of $\n1.01\nbillion (including allowance for credit losses of $\n774\nmillion) as of December 2022 and $\n1.05\nbillion (including allowance for credit losses of $\n776\nmillion) as of December 2021. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $\n5.95\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n4.17\nbillion as of December 2021. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $\n3.11\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.91\nbillion as of December 2021 would have been classified in level 2, and $\n2.84\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n2.26\nbillion as of December 2021 would have been classified in level 3.\n•\nHeld for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $\n88\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n91\nmillion as of December 2021. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments approximates the carrying value. Had these lending commitments been included in the fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 3 as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n•\nGains or losses related to lending commitments at fair value, if any, are generally recorded net of any fees in other principal transactions.\nCommercial Lending.\nThe firm’s commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers.\nSuch commitments primarily included $\n127.60\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n120.99\nbillion as of December 2021, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes), and $\n7.71\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n21.07\nbillion as of December 2021, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources).\nThe firm also extends lending commitments in connection with other types of corporate lending, commercial real estate financing and other collateralized lending.\nSee Note 9 for further information about funded loans.\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm’s commercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes.\nWarehouse Financing.\nThe firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are collateralized by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate loans.\nConsumer.\nThe firm’s consumer lending commitments includes:\n•\nCredit card lines issued by the firm to consumers were $\n62.22\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n33.97\nbillion as of December 2021. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. The increase in credit card lending commitments from December 2021 to December 2022 included approximately $\n15.0\nbillion relating to the firm’s acquisition of the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio in February 2022. In addition, consumer lending commitments as of December 2021 included a commitment of approximately $\n2.0\nbillion to acquire the outstanding credit card loans related to the General Motors co-branded credit card portfolio.\n•\nCommitments to provide unsecured installment loans to consumers were $\n1.88\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n9\nmillion as of December 2021. The increase in these lending commitments from December 2021 to December 2022 primarily related to commitments extended in connection with point-of-sale financing.\nRisk Participations\nThe firm also risk participates certain of its commercial lending commitments to other financial institutions. In the event of a risk participant’s default, the firm will be responsible to fund the borrower.\nCollateralized Agreement Commitments/ Collateralized Financing Commitments\nCollateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date, generally within three business days. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm’s funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Commitments\nInvestment commitments includes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages. Investment commitments included $\n1.29\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.60\nbillion as of December 2021, related to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm. If these commitments are called, they would be funded at market value on the date of investment.\nInvestment commitments as of December 2021 included approximately $\n1.90\nbillion related to the firm’s commitment to acquire NNIP and approximately $\n2.0\nbillion related to the firm’s commitment to acquire GreenSky. These acquisitions were completed in 2022. See Note 12 for information about these acquisitions. In addition, as of December 2021, the firm had an undrawn commitment of approximately $\n600\nmillion (included within other commitments) to GreenSky to acquire loans originated by GreenSky’s bank partners, which was terminated upon completion of the acquisition.\nContingencies\nLegal Proceedings.\nSee Note 27 for information about legal proceedings.\nGuarantees\nThe table below presents derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, securities lending and clearing guarantees and certain other financial guarantees.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe maximum payout is based on the notional amount of the contract and does not represent anticipated losses.\n•\nAmounts exclude certain commitments to issue standby letters of credit that are included in lending commitments. See the tables in “Commitments” above for a summary of the firm’s commitments.\n•\nThe carrying value for derivatives included derivative assets of $\n578\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n1.10\nbillion as of December 2021, and derivative liabilities of $\n8.06\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n4.51\nbillion as of December 2021.\nDerivative Guarantees.\nThe firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm’s overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at the inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above.\nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees\n. Securities lending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.\nAs an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed.\nThe maximum payout of such indemnifications was $\n12.23\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n11.05\nbillion as of December 2021. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $\n12.62\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n11.36\nbillion as of December 2021. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these indemnifications.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with certain resale and repurchase agreements. To minimize potential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a security interest in the collateral that the sponsored client placed with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. As of December 2022, the maximum payout on this guarantee was $\n8.74\nbillion and the related collateral held was $\n8.70\nbillion. There were\nno\namounts outstanding under the guarantee as of December 2021.\nOther Financial Guarantees\n. In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary.\nOther financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will receive, by August 2025, at least $\n1.4\nbillion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). In connection with this guarantee, the firm is also required to make a one-time interim payment of $\n250\nmillion towards the $\n1.4\nbillion if the Government of Malaysia has not received at least $\n500\nmillion in assets and proceeds by August 2022. The firm considers the reports that it receives on a semi-annual basis, expected in February and August, in evaluating the progress of Malaysia’s recovery efforts. The firm and the Government of Malaysia disagree about and, following an extension of the contractual dispute resolution period, continue to discuss whether the Government of Malaysia did, in fact, recover at least $\n500\nmillion as of August 2022 and whether any interim payment was due. If the parties are unable to resolve this dispute, it would be settled by arbitration. Any amounts paid by the firm would, in any event, be subject to reimbursement in the event the assets and proceeds received by the Government of Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceed $\n1.4\nbillion. See Note 27 for further information about matters related to 1MDB.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts.\nThe firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Notes 14 and 19 for further information about the transactions involving the Trusts.\nThe firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. No subsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the securities of the Trusts.\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities.\nIndemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates.\nThe firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including sub-custodians and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios.\nIn connection with the firm’s prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle transactions entered into by clients with other brokerage firms. The firm’s obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client’s account and proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and other matters involving the borrower.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nOther Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications.\nThe firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives.\nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S. tax laws.\nThese indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\nGuarantees of Subsidiaries.\nGroup Inc. is the entity that fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and GSBE related to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties. Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its subsidiary guarantees. However, because these obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.’s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed.\nNote 19.\nShareholders’ Equity\nCommon Equity\nAs of both December 2022 and December 2021, the firm had\n4.00\nbillion authorized shares of common stock and\n200\nmillion authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $\n0.01\nper share. During 2022, in connection with the acquisition of GreenSky, the firm issued approximately\n5.5\nmillion shares of common stock, including approximately\n325,000\nshares subject to future service.\nThe firm’s share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by the firm’s current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm’s common stock.\nThe table below presents information about common stock repurchases.\nPursuant to the terms of certain share-based compensation plans, employees may remit shares to the firm or the firm may cancel share-based awards to satisfy statutory employee tax withholding requirements.\nUnder these plans,\n11,644\nshares in 2022,\n1,830\nshares in 2021 and\n3,476\nshares in 2020 were remitted with a total value of $\n4\nmillion in 2022, $\n0.5\nmillion in 2021 and $\n0.9\nmillion in 2020, and the firm cancelled\n4.6\nmillion share-based awards in 2022, and\n3.4\nmillion in both 2021 and 2020, with a total value of $\n1.59\nbillion in 2022, $\n984\nmillion in 2021 and $\n829\nmillion in 2020.\nThe table below presents common stock dividends declared.\nOn January 13, 2023, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) declared a dividend of $\n2.50\nper common share to be paid on March 30, 2023 to common shareholders of record on March 2, 2023.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPreferred Equity\nThe tables below present information about the perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 2022.\nIn the tables above:\n•\nAll shares have a par value of $\n0.01\nper share and, where applicable, each share is represented by the specified number of depositary shares.\n•\nThe earliest redemption date represents the date on which each share of non-cumulative preferred stock is redeemable at the firm’s option.\n•\nPrior to redeeming preferred stock, the firm must receive approval from the FRB.\n•\nThe redemption price per share for Series A through F and Series Q through V Preferred Stock is the liquidation preference plus declared and unpaid dividends. The redemption price per share for Series J through P Preferred Stock is the liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends.\n•\nAll series of preferred stock are pari passu and have a preference over the firm’s common stock on liquidation.\n•\nThe firm’s ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, its common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event that the firm fails to pay or set aside full dividends on the preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period.\n•\nSeries E and Series F Preferred Stock are held by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III, respectively. These trusts are Delaware statutory trusts sponsored by the firm and wholly-owned finance subsidiaries of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but are not consolidated for accounting purposes.\nIn 2021, the firm redeemed all outstanding shares of its (i) Series N\n6.30\n% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock with a redemption value of $\n675\nmillion ($\n25,000\nper share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends and (ii) Series M\n5.375\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock with a redemption value of $\n2\nbillion ($\n25,000\nper share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The difference between the redemption value and net carrying value at the time of these redemptions was $\n41\nmillion, which was recorded as an addition to preferred stock dividends in 2021.\nIn 2020, the firm redeemed the remaining\n14,000\noutstanding shares of its Series L\n5.70\n% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock with a redemption value of $\n350\nmillion ($\n25,000\nper share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The difference between the redemption value and net carrying value was $\n1\nmillion, which was recorded as an addition to preferred stock dividends in 2020.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the dividend rates of perpetual preferred stock as of December 2022.\nIn the table above, dividends on each series of preferred stock are payable in arrears for the periods specified.\nThe table below presents preferred stock dividends declared.\nOn\nJanuary 5, 2023\n, Group Inc. declared dividends of $\n341.29\nper share of Series A Preferred Stock, $\n341.29\nper share of Series C Preferred Stock, $\n336.18\nper share of Series D Preferred Stock, $\n343.75\nper share of Series J Preferred Stock, $\n398.44\nper share of Series K Preferred Stock, $\n476.99\nper share of Series P Preferred Stock, $\n687.50\nper share of Series Q Preferred Stock, $\n618.75\nper share of Series R Preferred Stock, $\n550.00\nper share of Series S Preferred Stock and $\n456.25\nper share of Series U Preferred Stock to be paid on February 10, 2023 to preferred shareholders of record on January 26, 2023. In addition, the firm declared dividends of $\n1,382.02\nper share of Series E Preferred Stock and $\n1,382.64\nper share of Series F Preferred Stock to be paid on March 1, 2023 to preferred shareholders of record on February 14, 2023.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)\nThe table below presents changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, by type.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 20.\nRegulation and Capital Adequacy\nThe FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework).\nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the firm’s regulators and could limit the firm’s ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm’s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm’s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements.\nCapital Framework\nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an “Advanced approaches” banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements. The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\nThe firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules must meet its respective capital requirements.\nUnder the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to leverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital Requirements\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios.\nThe table below presents the risk-based capital requirements.\nIn the table above:\n•\nAs of both December 2022 and December 2021, under both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules, the CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of\n4.5\n%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of\n6.0\n% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of\n8.0\n%. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements, consisting of the G-SIB surcharge of\n2.5\n% (Method 2) and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to\nzero percent\n. In addition, the capital conservation buffer requirements include the stress capital buffer of\n6.3\n% as of December 2022 and\n6.4\n% as of December 2021 under the Standardized Capital Rules and a buffer of\n2.5\n% under the Advanced Capital Rules.\n•\nThe G-SIB surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year and is generally applicable for the following year. The G-SIB surcharge is calculated using two methodologies, the higher of which is reflected in the firm’s risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee’s methodology which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, activity and complexity of each G-SIB. The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, the firm updated the probability of default models used in the calculation of Advanced RWAs. The impact of this change was a decrease in the firm's Advanced CET1 capital ratio of approximately\n0.7\npercentage points.\nIn the second half of 2022, based on regulatory feedback, the firm revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the calculation of Standardized and Advanced RWAs. As of December 2021, this change would have increased the firm's Standardized RWAs of $\n677\nbillion by approximately $\n12\nbillion, which would have reduced the firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio of\n14.2\n% by\n0.2\npercentage points, Standardized Tier 1 capital ratio of\n15.8\n% by\n0.3\npercentage points and Standardized Total capital ratio of\n17.9\n% by\n0.3\npercentage points. As of December 2021, this change would have increased the firm's Advanced RWAs of $\n648\nbillion by approximately $\n6\nbillion, which would have reduced the firm's Advanced CET1 capital ratio of\n14.9\n% by\n0.2\npercentage points, Advanced Tier 1 capital ratio of\n16.5\n% by\n0.2\npercentage points and Advanced Total capital ratio of\n18.3\n% by\n0.1\npercentage points.\nLeverage Ratios.\nThe table below presents the leverage requirements.\nIn the table above, the SLR requirement of\n5\n% includes a minimum of\n3\n% and a\n2\n% buffer applicable to G-SIBs.\nThe table below presents information about leverage ratios.\nIn the table above:\n•\nAverage total assets represents the average daily assets for the quarter adjusted for the impact of Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) transition.\n•\nOff-balance sheet and other exposures primarily includes the monthly average of off-balance sheet exposures, consisting of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees.\n•\nTier 1 leverage ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by average adjusted total assets.\n•\nSLR is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRisk-Based Capital.\nThe table below presents information about risk-based capital.\nIn the table above:\n•\nBeginning in January 2022, the firm started to phase in the estimated reduction to regulatory capital as a result of adopting the CECL model. Impact of CECL transition in the table above reflects the total amount of reduction of $\n1.11\nbillion as of December 2021 to be phased in through January 2025 (at\n25\n% per year), of which $\n276\nmillion was phased in on January 1, 2022. The total amount to be phased in includes the impact of adopting CECL as of January 1, 2020, as well as\n25\n% of the increase in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021.\n•\nDeduction for goodwill was net of deferred tax liabilities of $\n700\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n675\nmillion as of December 2021.\n•\nDeduction for identifiable intangible assets was net of deferred tax liabilities of $\n239\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n17\nmillion as of December 2021.\n•\nDeduction for investments in covered funds represents the firm’s aggregate investments in applicable covered funds. As of December 2021, this deduction excluded investments that were subject to an extended conformance period. See Note 8 for further information about the Volcker Rule.\n•\nOther adjustments within CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital primarily include credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities, the overfunded portion of the firm’s defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, debt valuation adjustments and other required credit risk-based deductions. Other adjustments within Advanced Tier 2 capital include eligible credit reserves.\n•\nQualifying subordinated debt is subordinated debt issued by Group Inc. with an original maturity of\nfive years\nor greater. The outstanding amount of subordinated debt qualifying for Tier 2 capital is reduced upon reaching a remaining maturity of\nfive years\n. See Note 14 for further information about the firm’s subordinated debt.\n•\nJunior subordinated debt is debt issued to a Trust and was fully phased out of regulatory capital on January 1, 2022. As of December 2021,\n10\n% of this debt was included in Tier 2 capital and\n90\n% was phased out of regulatory capital. Junior subordinated debt is reduced by the amount of Trust Preferred securities purchased by the firm. See Note 14 for further information about the firm’s junior subordinated debt and Trust Preferred securities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents changes in CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\nRWAs.\nRWAs are calculated in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules.\nCredit Risk\nCredit RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure, which are then risk weighted under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules:\n•\nThe Standardized Capital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights, which depend largely on the type of counterparty. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are based on specific formulas which take certain factors into consideration.\n•\nUnder the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm computes risk-weights for wholesale and retail credit exposures in accordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are computed utilizing internal models.\n•\nFor both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations and equities are based on specific required formulaic approaches.\nMarket Risk\nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following:\n•\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a\n95\n%\none-day\nVaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a\n99\n%\n10-day\nVaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a\n99\n%\none-day\nVaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR.\nThe firm’s positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its\n99\n%\none-day\nregulatory VaR on one occasion during each of the years\nended 2022 and 2021. There was no change in the firm’s VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs;\n•\nStressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress;\n•\nIncremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time horizon;\n•\nComprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within the firm’s credit correlation positions; and\n•\nSpecific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting is performed.\nOperational Risk\nOperational RWAs are only required to be included under the Advanced Capital Rules. The firm utilizes an internal risk-based model to quantify Operational RWAs.\nThe table below presents information about RWAs.\nIn the table above:\n•\nSecurities financing transactions represents resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions.\n•\nOther includes receivables, certain debt securities, cash and cash equivalents, and other assets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents changes in RWAs.\nRWAs Rollforward Commentary\nYear Ended December 2022.\nStandardized Credit RWAs as of December 2022 decreased by $\n30.21\nbillion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting a decrease in derivatives (principally due to reduced exposures) and a decrease in equity investments (principally due to reduced exposures as a result of sales and unrealized losses). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity). Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $\n6.77\nbillion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to higher levels of market volatility).\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $\n22.81\nbillion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans, other credit RWAs and securities financing transactions (principally due to updates to the probability of default models in the fourth quarter of 2022). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity investments (principally due to reduced exposures as a result of sales and unrealized losses). Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $\n6.77\nbillion compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to higher levels of market volatility). Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2022 increased by $\n1.95\nbillion compared with December 2021, primarily associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nBank Subsidiaries\nGS Bank USA.\nGS Bank USA is the firm’s primary U.S. bank subsidiary. GS Bank USA is a New York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated under the Capital Framework. GS Bank USA is an Advanced approaches banking organization under the Capital Framework. The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law.\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements (consisting of a\n2.5\n% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer). The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as CET1 capital. In addition, the Capital Framework includes the leverage ratio requirement.\nGS Bank USA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA’s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for a “well-capitalized” depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the “well-capitalized” requirements in the table below. GS Bank USA’s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to comply with the capital requirements, including a breach of the buffers described below, would result in restrictions being imposed by the regulators.\nThe table below presents GS Bank USA’s risk-based capital, leverage and “well-capitalized” requirements.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of\n4.5\n%, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of\n6.0\n% and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of\n8.0\n%. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements consisting of a\n2.5\n% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to\nzero percent\n.\n•\nThe “well-capitalized” requirements are the binding requirements for leverage ratios.\nThe table below presents information about GS Bank USA’s risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe lower of the Standardized or Advanced ratio is the ratio against which GS Bank USA’s compliance with the capital requirements is assessed under the risk-based Capital Rules, and therefore, the Standardized ratios applied to GS Bank USA as of both December 2022 and December 2021.\n•\nBeginning in January 2022, GS Bank USA started to phase in the estimated reduction to regulatory capital as a result of adopting the CECL model. The total amount to be phased in includes the impact of adopting CECL as of January 1, 2020, as well as\n25\n% of the increase in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021.\n•\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, the firm updated the probability of default models used in the calculation of Advanced RWAs. The impact of this change was a decrease in GS Bank USA's Advanced CET1 capital ratio of approximately\n1\npercentage point.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n•\nThe Standardized and Advanced risk-based capital ratios decreased from December 2021 to December 2022, reflecting an increase in both Credit and Market RWAs, partially offset by an increase in capital, principally due to net earnings and capital contributions.\nThe table below presents information about GS Bank USA’s leverage ratios.\nIn the table above:\n•\nAverage adjusted total assets represents the average daily assets for the quarter adjusted for deductions from Tier 1 capital and the impact of CECL transition.\n•\nTier 1 leverage ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by average adjusted total assets.\n•\nSLR is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.\nThe FRB requires that GS Bank USA maintain cash reserves with the Federal Reserve. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, the reserve requirement ratio was zero percent. See Note 26 for further information about cash deposits held by the firm at the Federal Reserve.\nGS Bank USA is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GS Bank USA was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers.\nGSIB.\nGSIB is the firm’s U.K. bank subsidiary regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). GSIB is subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is largely based on Basel III. The eligible retail deposits of GSIB are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme to the extent provided by law.\nThe table below presents GSIB’s risk-based capital requirements.\nThe table below presents information about GSIB’s risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above, the risk-based capital ratios as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSIB’s external auditors and approval by GSIB’s Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately\n161\nbasis points to the CET1 capital ratio as of December 2022.\nGSIB is also subject to the minimum leverage ratio requirement of\n3.25\n% established by the PRA, which became effective January 1, 2023. GSIB had a leverage ratio of\n6.9\n% as of December 2022. The leverage ratio as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSIB’s external auditors and approval by GSIB’s Board of Directors for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately\n56\nbasis points to the leverage ratio as of December 2022.\nGSIB is subject to minimum reserve requirements at central banks in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GSIB was in compliance with these requirements.\nGSBE.\nGSBE is the firm’s German bank subsidiary supervised by the European Central Bank, BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank. GSBE is a non-U.S. banking subsidiary of GS Bank USA and is also subject to standalone regulatory capital requirements noted below. GSBE is subject to the capital requirements prescribed in the amended E.U. Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), which are largely based on Basel III. The deposits of GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate in the German voluntary deposit protection program which provides insurance for certain eligible deposits not covered by the German statutory deposit program.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents GSBE’s risk-based capital requirements.\nThe table below presents information about GSBE’s risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above, the risk-based capital ratios as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSBE’s external auditors and approval by GSBE’s shareholder (GS Bank USA) for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately\n76\nbasis points to the CET1 capital ratio as of December 2022.\nThe table below presents GSBE’s leverage ratio requirement and leverage ratios.\nIn the table above, the leverage ratio as of December 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to audit by GSBE’s external auditors and approval by GSBE’s shareholder (GS Bank USA) for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately\n57\nbasis points to the leverage ratio as of December 2022.\nGSBE is subject to minimum reserve requirements at central banks in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GSBE was in compliance with these requirements.\nGSBE is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, GSBE was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers.\nRestrictions on Payments\nGroup Inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. These limitations include provisions of applicable law and regulations and other regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. For example, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. As a result of dividends paid in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any additional dividends without prior regulatory approval.\nIn addition, subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk.\nGroup Inc.’s equity investment in subsidiaries was $\n134.59\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n118.90\nbillion as of December 2021, of which Group Inc. was required to maintain $\n82.52\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n77.22\nbillion as of December 2021, of minimum equity capital in its regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements of such subsidiaries.\nGroup Inc.’s capital invested in certain non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt and derivatives. See Note 7 for information about the firm’s net investment hedges used to hedge this risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 21.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and restricted stock units (RSUs) for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is not subject to satisfaction of future service, performance or market conditions (collectively, basic shares). Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable for RSUs for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is subject to satisfaction of future service, performance or market conditions.\nThe table below presents information about basic and diluted EPS.\nIn the table above:\n•\nNet earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends.\n•\nUnvested share-based awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities under the two-class method. Distributed earnings allocated to these securities reduce net earnings to common to calculate EPS under this method. The impact of applying this methodology was a reduction in basic EPS of $\n0.15\nfor 2022, $\n0.10\nfor 2021 and $\n0.07\nfor 2020.\n•\nDiluted EPS does not include antidilutive RSUs, including those that are subject to market conditions, of\n0.5\nmillion for 2022,\n0.3\nmillion for 2021 and\n0.1\nmillion for 2020.\nNote 22.\nTransactions with Affiliated Funds\nThe firm has formed nonconsolidated investment funds with third-party investors. As the firm generally acts as the investment manager for these funds, it is entitled to receive management fees and, in certain cases, advisory fees or incentive fees from these funds. Additionally, the firm invests alongside the third-party investors in certain funds.\nThe tables below present information about affiliated funds.\nThe firm has waived, and may waive in the future, certain management fees on selected money market funds to enhance the yield for investors in such funds. Management fees waived were $\n123\nmillion for 2022, $\n595\nmillion for 2021 and $\n109\nmillion for 2020.\nIn accordance with the Volcker Rule, the firm does not provide financial support to covered funds. However, in the ordinary course of business, the firm may choose to provide voluntary financial support to funds that are not subject to the Volcker Rule, although any such support is not expected to be material to the results of operations of the firm. Except for the fee waivers noted above, the firm did not provide any additional financial support to its affiliated funds during either 2022 or 2021.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm may also engage in other activities with its affiliated funds, including, among others, securities lending, trade execution, market-making, custody, and acquisition and bridge financing. See Note 18 for information about the firm’s investment commitments related to these funds.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 23.\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\nInterest is recorded over the life of the instrument on an accrual basis based on contractual interest rates.\nThe table below presents sources of interest income and interest expense.\nIn the table above:\n•\nCollateralized agreements includes rebates paid and interest income on securities borrowed.\n•\nLoans excludes interest on loans held for sale that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. Such interest is included within other interest.\n•\nOther interest income includes interest income on customer debit balances, other interest-earning assets and loans held for sale that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value.\n•\nCollateralized financings consists of repurchase agreements and securities loaned.\n•\nShort- and long-term borrowings include both secured and unsecured borrowings.\n•\nOther interest expense includes rebates received on other interest-bearing liabilities and interest expense on customer credit balances.\nNote 24.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The firm reports interest expense related to income tax matters in provision for taxes and income tax penalties in other expenses.\nThe table below presents information about the provision for taxes.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate.\nIn the table above, Non-U.S. operations include the impact of the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income\n.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized and primarily relate to the ability to utilize losses in various tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are included in other assets and tax liabilities are included in other liabilities.\nThe table below presents information about deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the impact of netting within tax jurisdictions.\nThe firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n787\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n681\nmillion as of December 2021, in connection with U.S. federal, state and local and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The firm also recorded a valuation allowance of $\n301\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n285\nmillion as of December 2021, related to these net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 2022, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward was $\n1.51\nbillion, the state and local net operating loss carryforward was $\n2.10\nbillion, and the foreign net operating loss carryforward was $\n1.38\nbillion. If not utilized, the U.S. federal, the state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023. If these carryforwards expire, they will not have a material impact on the firm’s results of operations. As of December 2022, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n37\nmillion in connection with foreign tax credit carryforwards and a related valuation allowance of $\n20\nmillion. As of December 2022, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n41\nmillion in connection with general business credit carryforwards and $\n9\nmillion in connection with state and local tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the foreign tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2033, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2023 and the state and local tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2024.\nAs of both December 2022 and December 2021, the firm had no U.S. capital loss carryforwards and\nno\nrelated net deferred income tax assets. As of December 2022, the firm had deferred tax assets of $\n277\nmillion in connection with foreign capital loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $\n277\nmillion related to these capital loss carryforwards.\nThe valuation allowance increased by $\n674\nmillion during 2022 and increased by $\n344\nmillion during 2021. The increases in both 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit.\nThe firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of both December 2022 and December 2021, all U.S. taxes were accrued on these subsidiaries’ distributable earnings.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $\n205\nmillion as of December 2022 and $\n131\nmillion as of December 2021. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $\n59\nmillion for 2022, $\n13\nmillion for 2021 and $\n41\nmillion for 2020. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2022 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change.\nThe table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.\nRegulatory Tax Examinations\nThe firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm’s financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period.\nThe table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction.\nThe firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2023. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. All issues for the 2011 and 2012 tax years have been resolved and completion is pending final review by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). During 2022, the firm reached an agreement with IRS Appeals on the remaining issues for tax years 2012 through 2019. Subject to final review by JCT, this agreement will not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. During 2022, the fieldwork for the 2020 tax year was completed and the final resolution is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2021 tax year remains subject to post-filing review. New York State and City examinations of 2015 through 2018 commenced during 2021.\nAll years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 25.\nBusiness Segments\nThe firm manages and reports its activities in\nthree\nbusiness segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. See Note 1 for information about the firm’s business segments, including the changes made during 2022.\nCompensation and benefits expenses in the firm’s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm’s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm’s other business segments.\nThe firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured client financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the three business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process is based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments.\nThe allocation of common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements.\nNet earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s pre-tax earnings.\nManagement believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment’s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.\nSegment Results\nThe table below presents a summary of the firm’s segment results.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above:\n•\nRevenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining pre-tax earnings.\n•\nNet revenues in the firm’s segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions.

The methodology for allocating profitability to geographic regions is dependent on estimates and management judgment because a significant portion of the firm’s activities require cross-border coordination in order to facilitate the needs of the firm’s clients. Geographic results are generally allocated as follows:\n•\nGlobal Banking & Markets: Investment banking fees and Other: location of the client and investment banking team; FICC intermediation and Equities intermediation: location of the market-making desk; FICC financing and Equities financing: location of the desk.\n•\nAsset & Wealth Management (excluding direct-to-consumer business, Equity investments and Debt investments): location of the sales team and/or investments; Direct-to-consumer business: location of the client; Equity investments and Debt investments: location of the investment or investment professional.\n•\nPlatform Solutions: location of the client.\nThe table below presents total net revenues, pre-tax earnings and net earnings by geographic region.\nIn the table above:\n•\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, in connection with the firm’s segment reorganization, the firm changed its methodology for allocating certain funding-related revenues not directly allocable to specific regions. As a result, reclassifications were made to the geographic allocation of net revenues. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\n•\nAsia pre-tax earnings and net earnings for 2020 were impacted by net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n•\nSubstantially all of the amounts in Americas were attributable to the U.S.\n•\nAsia includes Australia and New Zealand.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 26.\nCredit Concentrations\nThe firm’s concentrations of credit risk arise from its market-making, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearinghouse or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis.\nThe table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments.\nIn addition, the firm had $\n208.53\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n222.20\nbillion as of December 2021 of cash deposits held at central banks (included in cash and cash equivalents),\nof which $\n165.77\nbillion as of December 2022 and $\n122.01\nbillion as of December 2021 was held at the Federal Reserve.\nAs of both December 2022 and December 2021, the firm did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded\n2\n% of total assets.\nCollateral obtained by the firm related to derivative assets is principally cash and is held by the firm or a third-party custodian. Collateral obtained by the firm related to resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions is primarily U.S. government and agency obligations and non-U.S. government and agency obligations. See Note 11 for further information about collateralized agreements and financings.\nThe table below presents U.S. government and agency obligations and non-U.S. government and agency obligations that collateralize resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions.\nIn the table above:\n•\nNon-U.S. government and agency obligations primarily consists of securities issued by the governments of the U.K., Japan, Germany and France.\n•\nGiven that the firm’s primary credit exposure on such transactions is to the counterparty to the transaction, the firm would be exposed to the collateral issuer only in the event of counterparty default.\nNote 27.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of the firm’s businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.\nUnder ASC 450, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nWith respect to matters described below for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering and is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes will pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the purchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss based on (a) in the case of (i), the amount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the difference between the initial sales price of the securities that the firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest subsequent price of such securities prior to the action being commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that purchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if any, as of December 2022 of the relevant securities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors believed to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of that type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and for any other matters described below where management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately $\n2.3\nbillion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such matters.\nManagement is generally unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters other than those included in the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early stages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or reviews, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal issues presented. For example, the firm’s potential liabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews described below in “Regulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation” generally are not included in management’s estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of such other matters will have a material adverse effect on the firm’s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the firm’s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.\n1MDB-Related Matters\nBetween 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of the firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of approximately $\n6.5\nbillion of debt securities of 1MDB.\nOn November 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information and guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former participating managing director of the firm, and an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing director of the firm. On August 28, 2018, Leissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York of conspiring to launder money and to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Ng was charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. On April 8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts following a trial.\nOn August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the Government of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4\nbillion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further information about this guarantee.\nOn October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached settlements of governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the Singapore Attorney General’s Chambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and will later be dismissed if the firm abides by the terms of the agreement. In addition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a five-year exemption to maintain its status as a qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

On January 13, 2023, the court approved a settlement among the parties pursuant to which the firm agreed to a payment of $\n79.5\nmillion to be made to the firm by its insurers, which the firm has agreed to use for compliance purposes after payment of any attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of expenses awarded to plaintiffs.\nOn December 20, 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and certain former officers of the firm alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act with respect to Group Inc.’s disclosures and public statements concerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified damages.

The defendants have moved for summary judgment. On April 7, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s August 14, 2018 grant of class certification. On June 21, 2021, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Second Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings, and on August 26, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated the district court’s grant of class certification and remanded the case for further proceedings. On December 8, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On March 9, 2022, the Second Circuit granted defendants’ petition seeking interlocutory review of the district court’s grant of class certification.\nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts that issued $\n1.7\nbillion of securities.

The claim in the English action is for breaches of English and E.U. competition rules from 2003 to 2013 and alleges manipulation of foreign exchange rates and bid/offer spreads, the exchange of commercially sensitive information among defendants and collusive trading. On December 13, 2022, the parties reached settlements in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve these actions.\nGS&Co. is among the defendants named in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 4, 2021.

(Oak Finance), a special purpose vehicle formed in connection with the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In July 2018, the English Supreme Court found that the English courts will not have jurisdiction over GSI’s action unless and until the Portuguese Administrative Court finds against BoP in GSI’s parallel action. In July 2018, the Liquidation Committee for BES issued a decision seeking to claw back from GSI $\n54\nmillion paid to GSI and $\n50\nmillion allegedly paid to Oak Finance in connection with the Facility, alleging that GSI acted in bad faith in extending the Facility, including because GSI allegedly knew that BES was at risk of imminent failure. In October 2018, GSI commenced an action in Lisbon Commercial Court challenging the Liquidation Committee’s decision and has since also issued a claim against the Portuguese State seeking compensation for losses of approximately $\n222\nmillion related to the failure of BES, together with a contingent claim for the $\n104\nmillion sought by the Liquidation Committee.\nFinancial Advisory Services\nGroup Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time parties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings and other disputes with clients and third parties relating to the firm’s financial advisory activities.

Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.\nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs.\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In limited cases, as outlined in the applicable award agreements, the firm may cash settle share-based compensation awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award. The tax effect related to the settlement of share-based awards and payments of dividend equivalents is recorded in income tax benefit or expense.\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards, each of which may be subject to terms and conditions, including performance or market conditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor stock incentive plans, the first of which was adopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which was approved by the firm’s shareholders.\nAs of December 2022,\n60.8\nmillion shares were available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2021 SIP or awards granted under predecessor stock incentive plans are not delivered because such awards are forfeited, terminated or canceled, or if shares of common stock underlying such awards are surrendered or withheld to satisfy any obligation of the grantee (including taxes), those shares will become available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to be delivered under the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment for certain events or changes in corporate structure as provided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders that occurs in 2025.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance or market conditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on the date of grant, after taking into account a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions. The value of equity awards also considers the impact of material non-public information, if any, that the firm expects to make available shortly following grant. RSUs generally vest and underlying shares of common stock deliver (net of required withholding tax) as outlined in the applicable award agreements. Award agreements generally provide that vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability and, in certain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. RSUs not subject to performance or market conditions generally vest and deliver over a three-year period.\nRSUs that are subject to performance or market conditions generally deliver after the end of a\nthree\n- to\nfive-year\nperiod. For awards that are subject to performance or market conditions, generally the final award is adjusted from\nzero\nup to\n150\n% of the original grant based on the extent to which those conditions are satisfied. Dividend equivalents that accrue on these awards are paid when the awards settle.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the 2022 activity related to stock settled RSUs.\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted was $\n316.98\nduring 2022, $\n264.57\nduring 2021 and $\n220.45\nduring 2020.

These RSUs are subject to additional conditions as outlined in the award agreements. Shares underlying these RSUs, net of required withholding tax, generally deliver over a\nthree-year\nperiod. These awards are generally subject to a\none-year\npost-vesting and delivery transfer restriction. These awards are not included in the table above.\nAs of December 2022, there was $\n860\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.86\nyears. In addition, there is unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements subject to performance conditions. The maximum payout related to these awards is $\n124\nmillion. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.92\nyears.\nThe table below presents the share-based compensation and the related excess tax benefit.\nIn the table above, excess net tax benefit for share-based awards includes the net tax benefit on dividend equivalents paid on RSUs and the delivery of common stock underlying share-based awards.\nOverrides\nThe firm shares a portion of its overrides related to investment management services with approximately\n800\nemployees.
