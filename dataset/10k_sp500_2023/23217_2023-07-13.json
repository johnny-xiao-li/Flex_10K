    "text": "General Development of Business\nConagra Brands, Inc. (the \"Company\", \"Conagra Brands\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\"), headquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as\nBirds Eye\n®\n,\nDuncan Hines\n®\n,\nHealthy Choice\n®\n,\nMarie Callender's\n®\n,\nReddi-wip\n®\n, and\nSlim Jim\n®\n, as well as emerging brands, including\nAngie's\n®\nBOOMCHICKAPOP\n®\n,\nDuke's\n®\n,\nEarth Balance\n®\n,\nGardein\n®\n, and\nFrontera\n®\n, offer choices for every occasion.\nWe began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1976. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged goods food company we are today. Growing our food businesses has also been fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories, including through acquisitions. We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital.\nNarrative Description of Business\nWe compete throughout the food industry and focus on adding value for our customers who operate in the retail food and foodservice channels.\nOur operations, including our reporting segments, are described below. Our locations, including manufacturing facilities, within each reporting segment, are described in Item 2,\nProperties\n.\nReporting Segments\nOur reporting segments are as follows:\nGrocery & Snacks\nThe Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\nRefrigerated & Frozen\nThe Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\n1\nInternational\nThe International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.\nFoodservice\nThe Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.\nUnconsolidated Equity Investments\nWe have two unconsolidated equity investments. Our most significant equity method investment is our joint venture with respect to Ardent Mills, a milling business.\nGeneral\nThe following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments.\nConagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, most of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as global economic conditions, trade barriers or restrictions, supply chain disruptions, supply and demand, weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.\nWe experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, product innovation, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty.\n2\nDemand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. For example, sales of frozen foods tend to be marginally higher during the winter months, seafood sales are highest during Lent, in advance of the Easter holiday, and production of certain of our products occurs seasonally, during or immediately following the purchase of agricultural crops.\nOur intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, licensing agreements, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights are of material importance to our business, and we attempt to protect such rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws, as well as entering into licensing, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others, including under the\nP.F. Chang\n’\ns\n®,\nBertolli\n®, and\nLibby\n’\ns\n® trademarks. We also own certain intellectual property rights that are licensed to third parties, such as the\nAlexia\n® trademark. While many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature, others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.\nOur operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, local, and foreign government agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Labor. In particular, the processing, packaging, transportation, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation. Additionally, we are subject to data privacy and security regulations, tax and securities regulations, accounting and reporting standards, and other financial laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.\nOur largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 28%, 27%, and 26% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt Conagra, we believe that our employees are the driving force behind our success. We believe that the success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We leverage our six timeless values, which form the framework of our Company culture, to guide our approach to human capital management:\nWe have developed key recruitment, development, and retention strategies and objectives that guide our human capital management approach. These strategies and objectives are advanced through a number of programs, policies, and initiatives, as described below.\nAs of May 28, 2023, we had approximately\n18,600\nemployees, primarily in the United States. Approximately\n46%\nof our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.\n3\nSafety and Health:\nThe health and safety of our employees is our top priority. We are focused on maintaining a strong culture of safety, in which all employees strive to protect themselves and their colleagues. During fiscal year 2023, our Occupational Safety & Health Administration Incident Rate w\nas 1.58 incidents p\ner 100 full-time workers, as compared to 1.67 incidents per 100 full-time workers in fiscal 2022 and 2.00 incidents per 100 full-time workers in fiscal 2021. We compare our incident rate to that of the average for companies in the food manufacturing sector, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In each of the last three fiscal years, our incident rate has been below the industry average. Our health and safety team audits each of our facilities every three years to confirm compliance with safety regulations and corporate policies. The team documents the audit results and tracks corrective actions to completion to confirm we hold ourselves accountable for providing a safe work environment.\nDiversity and Inclusion:\nWe nourish our inclusive culture by encouraging openness, acceptance, and individual authenticity. We believe that a diverse team gives us a competitive advantage and are committed to incorporating different ways of thinking, backgrounds, experiences, opinions, and viewpoints into our workforce to energize our culture and drive our success.\nWe believe diversity is measured by more than age, race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability. All backgrounds, perspectives, styles, and opinions are valued and belong at Conagra. We harness the power of diversity and inclusion (\"D&I\") to accelerate innovation and growth and as key drivers of shareholder value creation.\nOur commitment to D&I is exemplified by our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") with ages ranging from 51 to 71, diverse backgrounds and life experiences, three racially/ethnically diverse directors and four women directors serving on our ten-person board. The Human Resources Committee of our Board (the \"HR Committee\") oversees our D&I strategy. The HR Committee has embedded its oversight of our diversity and inclusion strategy into its standing agenda and receives regular updates from management on our diversity and inclusion goals and initiatives. We have set D&I goals that were embedded by our HR Committee into our executive compensation program for fiscal 2023 in the individual performance modifier for senior leaders under our annual incentive plan.\nOur Senior Leadership Team is responsible for setting and driving our D&I strategy. During fiscal 2023, we launched numerous efforts to amplify our commitment to D&I through our D&I Leadership Council, comprised of senior leaders with a continued focus on driving accountability towards operationalizing our three strategic D&I pillars of recruitment, advocacy and development. Core aspects of our strategy include building a strong entry-level pipeline; developing programs to internally and externally advance our talent; and designing education and awareness programs that strengthen our culture of inclusion.  Examples of recruitment, advocacy, and development initiatives launched during fiscal 2023 include the following:\n4\nOur goal is to create a culture of belonging, where everyone can experience inclusion. We want to be a place where people trust and respect one another. While we value and embrace diversity, we also celebrate what we all have in common—our energy and passion for making great food and great brands.\nLearning and Development:\nWe believe that by enabling employee growth and development, we better position Conagra to meet current and future business needs while driving employee retention. By providing employees with growth opportunities, we empower them to build knowledge and skills and make an impact through their work at Conagra.\nWe leverage a variety of tools and processes to promote a culture of employee learning and development at Conagra:\nTalent Acquisition:\nWe believe Conagra offers one of the best cultures in the food industry along with numerous components for a long and prosperous career.  Our Conagra Promise is to provide every employee with tools and programs to help them reach their full potential.\nWhile the current labor market presents significant challenges for employers, Conagra has made differential investments in our Talent Acquisition tools and programs to help us continue to attract the right candidates.\nCompensation and Benefits:\nWe offer competitive compensation and benefits to attract the best talent and to support the overall well-being of our employees. Through our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees with resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, family care resources, a 401(k) plan, family leave, and paid time off.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe names, ages, and positions of our executive officers as of July 13, 2023 are listed below:\nSean M.

    "text": "Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.\nMarket Risks\nDeterioration of general economic conditions, an economic recession, periods of inflation, or economic uncertainty\nhave in the past harmed and could continue to harm our business and results of operations\n.\nOur business and results of operations have in the past been and may continue to be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, decreased availability of capital, volatility in financial markets, declining consumer spending rates, recessions, decreased energy availability and increased energy costs (including fuel surcharges), supply chain challenges, labor shortages, geopolitical conflicts (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.\nThese economic factors could continue to impact our business and operations in a variety of ways, including as follows:\n7\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations\nhave in the past been and could continue to\nbe adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by geopolitical conflict including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been impacted in the past and may be impacted in the future by disruptions in the global economy. The global economy has been negatively impacted by geopolitical conflicts, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union imposing export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. Although we have no operations in Russia or Ukraine, we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. Further escalations of geopolitical tensions related to military conflicts, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could also result in, among other things, cyberattacks, supply disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. In addition, the effects of the ongoing conflict could heighten many of our known risks described in this Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n.\nCredit Risks\nOur existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations or returning cash to stockholders.\nAs of May 28, 2023, we had total debt of approximately\n$9.24\nbillion, including approximately\n$8.02\nbillion aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes. Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, make planned capital expenditures, and return cash to stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs, make planned capital expenditures, or return cash to stockholders.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\nAdditionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings. In the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable. Any default under the agreements governing our debt and the remedies sought by the holders of such debt could render us unable to pay principal and interest on our debt.\nRecently, we have increasingly accessed the commercial paper markets for ongoing funding requirements. A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper. Additionally, disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets could also reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs.\n8\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans, or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans, or other payments. In addition, any payment of dividends, loans, or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us. Finally, changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us.\nHeightened inflation, increased interest rates and other economic conditions including potential recession and credit market disruptions could negatively impact our business.\nCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by heightened inflation, increased interest rates and other weak economic conditions including recessionary conditions and credit market disruptions and volatility. For example, in fiscal 2023, the U.S. experienced heightened inflationary pressures that impacted our business. Continued weak economic conditions may adversely impact consumers causing a decrease in demand for our products from our customers and consumers. Additionally, these economic conditions may adversely impact some of our customers, suppliers and other vendors who are highly leveraged. We have experienced and may continue to experience negative impacts to our business ranging from an inability to collect accounts receivable to supply chain disruptions caused by failures of our counterparties to continue as a going concern due to financial and liquidity issues.\nCompetition Risks\nIncreased competition may result in reduced sales or profits.\nThe food industry is highly competitive, and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition. Our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices and maintain those price increases, including price increases made in response to commodity and other cost increases. In addition, we may experience delays between the time that we take inflation-related pricing actions and the time that we realize the impact of those actions on our margins and results of operations.\nWe sell branded, private brand, and customized food products, as well as commercially branded foods. Our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition, although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing market share. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.\nIn addition, substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits.\nIf we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food industry, our profitability could decrease.\nOur future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to achieve the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of volatile input costs. We continue to implement profit-enhancing initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative overhead levels. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. If we do not continue to effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies, our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease.\nCommodity Risks\nWe are subject to increases in the price of raw materials, labor, manufacturing, distribution, and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products, and we may not be able to fully offset this input cost inflation on a timely basis or at all.\nMany of the components of our cost of goods sold are subject to price increases that are attributable to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, global economic conditions, trade barriers or restrictions, supply chain disruptions, changes in crop size, product scarcity, demand dynamics, currency rates, water supply, weather conditions, import and export requirements, and other factors. The cost of raw materials, labor, manufacturing, energy, fuel, packaging materials, and other inputs related to the production and distribution of our products have increased and may continue to increase unexpectedly.\n9\nIn recent years, input costs have increased materially and at a rapid rate. We expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into fiscal 2024.\nThe Company uses a variety of strategies to seek to offset this input cost inflation such as increasing productivity, cutting costs, increasing pricing and engaging in commodity hedging. However, we may not be able to generate sufficient productivity improvements or sustain our price increases. Commodity price volatility may result in unfavorable commodity positions, the costs of which we may not be able to fully offset on acceptable timelines or at all. To the extent we are unable to offset present and future input cost increases, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nIncreases in commodity costs have in the past and may continue to have a negative impact on profits.\nWe use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats, various vegetables, vegetable oils, beef, pork, poultry, dairy products, steel,\naluminum, and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by global economic conditions, trade barriers or restrictions, supply chain disruptions, commodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, external conditions such as weather, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. In addition, recent world events have increased the risks posed by international trade disputes, tariffs, and sanctions. We procure a wide spectrum of commodities globally and in the past have faced increased prices for commodities sourced from nations that have been impacted by trade disputes, tariffs, or sanctions. Commodity price increases have resulted and may in the future result in increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs and operating costs. We have experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend.\nTo mitigate commodity cost increases, we have implemented various strategies that include, among other things, entering into contracted pricing with certain vendors, procuring commodities in periods of favorable market conditions, or entering into various derivative instruments. These actions may in part mitigate these increased costs, but even by increasing our product prices or implementing cost savings efforts, we may not be able to fully offset these increased costs. Additionally, increased prices may not be sustainable over time and may result in reduced sales volume, which can negatively impact our margins, and profitability.\nVolatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.\nWe utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (wheat and corn), vegetable oils, pork, dairy products, and energy. Changes in the values of these derivatives are generally recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.\nOperating Risks\nSupply chain disruptions have in the past and could continue to negatively impact our profitability.\nIn recent years, our industry has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, transportation issues, labor challenges and continued changes in global economic conditions, which have impacted and could continue to impact our operations and profitability.  Continued inflation, rising interest rates, decreased availability of capital, volatility in financial markets, declining consumer spending rates, recessions, decreased energy availability and increased energy costs (including fuel surcharges) have in the past caused and could continue to cause challenges for us, our suppliers, vendors, customers and consumers of our products and may negatively impact our profitability.  These supply chain disruptions have impacted our ability to source ingredients and manufacture and distribute our products, and may make it difficult for our customers to accurately forecast and plan for their purchases of our products to optimize restocking, all of which could negatively impact our business and profitability.\nWe\nhave in the past been and may in the future be subject to product liability claims, labeling claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our profitability\n.\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. We may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness, or death. In addition, we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. We have issued recalls and have from time to time been and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food products. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction, customer reaction, and consumer attitudes.\nIn addition, we could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws as well as foreign laws, including consumer protection statutes of some states.  The marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive labeling and marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling, including front of pack labeling, and serving size regulations), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. If we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven if a product liability or labeling claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.\n10\nAdditionally, as a manufacturer and marketer of food products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, and local government agencies. The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and the Food Safety Modernization Act and their respective regulations govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, and safety of food products. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior; meaning that no intent is required to be established. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAny damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMaintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our products. Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations of product quality issues, mislabeling, or contamination, even if untrue, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: product recalls, the failure to maintain high ethical, social, and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities including our expectations for our supply chain regarding ethical sourcing; the failure to achieve any stated goals with respect to the nutritional profile of our products; our research and development efforts; or our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, energy use, and waste management.\nMoreover, the growing use of social and digital media by consumers has greatly increased the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation.\nFailure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nDue to the seasonality of the business, our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter.\nOur sales and cash flows are affected by seasonal cyclicality. Sales of frozen foods, including frozen vegetables and frozen complete bagged meals, tend to be marginally higher during the winter months. Seafood sales peak during Lent, in advance of the Easter holiday. Since many of the raw materials we process are agricultural crops, production of these products is predominantly seasonal, occurring during and immediately following the purchase of such crops. For these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons are not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future. If we are unable to obtain access to working capital or if seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCustomer Risks\nWe must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences.\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the priorities, tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences.  Consumer response to our products may be influenced by a growing number and complexity of factors influencing consumer purchasing decisions beyond taste, nutrition and value, including concerns of consumers regarding broader health and wellness perceptions, obesity, product attributes, sourcing of packaging materials, use of organic or natural ingredients, human rights impacts, environmental impacts, recyclability of packaging and local sourcing of ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment.\nIf our products fail to meet changing consumer preferences or habits, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions, marketing, and innovation will be less successful. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.\nAdditionally, as we have continued to implement pricing actions in response to increased costs of goods sold, the elasticity impact from our pricing actions has been favorable to date compared to historical trends. However, demand for our products could be affected if elasticities become unfavorable in response to our pricing actions in the future.\nChanges in our relationships with significant customers, including our largest customer, could adversely affect us.\nDuring fiscal 2023, our largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 28% of our consolidated net sales. There can be no assurance that Walmart, Inc. and other significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us and their decision to purchase from us is driven by multiple factors including consumer preferences and demand, price, product quality, customer service performance, availability, and other factors.  Strategic and financial goals of our customers can impact their purchasing decisions including store space allocation among product categories and shelf placement of our products.\n11\nThe sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits.\nOur customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business. These consolidations, the growth of supercenters, and the growth of e-commerce customers have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and who can demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products, for their store brand products. We continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures. However, if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength and/or increased private label or store brand competition, our profitability could decline.\nConsolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers' business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.\nThird-Party Partner Risks\nDisruption of our supply chain has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success. In the last two fiscal years, we experienced disruption to our supply and elevated supply chain operating costs due, in part, to disruptions in the availability of labor and certain materials, and input cost inflation. Continued or future damage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes, government action, geopolitical turmoil (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlthough our products are manufactured in North America and we source the significant majority of our ingredients and raw materials from North America, global supply has at times been and may continue to be constrained, which has caused and may continue to cause the price of certain ingredients and raw materials used in our products to increase and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations. Additionally, although we have no operations in Russia and Ukraine, we have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict on the global economy. To date, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, but continued geopolitical turmoil, including expansion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict into other countries, or conflicts in other parts of the world, may negatively impact our supply chain and our ability to manufacture or sell our products.\nThe termination or expiration of current co-manufacturing arrangements could reduce our sales volume and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur businesses periodically enter into co-manufacturing arrangements with manufacturers of products. The terms of these agreements vary. Although many agreements are for a relatively short period of time, some of the co-manufacturing agreements are for extended periods. Volumes produced under each of these agreements can fluctuate significantly based upon the product's life cycle, product promotions, alternative production capacity, and other factors, none of which are under our direct control. Our future ability to enter into co-manufacturing arrangements is not guaranteed, and a decrease in current co-manufacturing levels could have a significant negative impact on sales volume.\nAs we outsource certain functions, we become more dependent on the third parties performing those functions.\nAs part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, we have entered into agreements with third-party service providers under which we have outsourced certain information systems, sales, finance, accounting, and other functions, and we may enter into managed services agreements with respect to other functions in the future. If any of these third-party service providers do not perform according to the terms of the agreements, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers, and our reputation could be harmed. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business interruption, damage or disruption of information technology systems, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or non-public company sensitive information, effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, if we transition functions to one or more new, or among existing, external service providers, we may experience challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\n12\nOur operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties.\nThe success of our end-to-end supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties. Suppliers, co-manufacturers, third-party outsourcers, warehousing partners, and transportation providers are among our critical partners. Although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business, we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all. It is possible that events beyond our control, such as operational failures, labor issues, cybersecurity events, pandemics or other health issues, such as COVID-19, or other issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties. If our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments, introduce unplanned risk to our operations, or are unable to fulfill their obligations, we could experience manufacturing challenges, shipment delays, increased costs, or lost revenue.\nWe may be negatively impacted by cybersecurity incidents involving third parties in our supply chain.\nIf any of our third party service providers or any other third parties in our supply chain experience a cyber breach or system failure, their businesses may be negatively impacted, which can disrupt our end-to-end supply chain or affect our ability to fulfill customer orders, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we incurred charges totaling $4.4 million ($3.3 million after-tax) related to supply chain disruptions caused by a third-party vendor’s system shutdown in connection with the third party experiencing a cybersecurity incident.  The vendor’s shut-down disrupted our operations and negatively impacted our ability to fulfill customer orders.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Environmental Risks\nIf we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties. In addition, changes in such laws may lead to increased costs.\nOur business is subject to a variety of governmental laws and regulations, including food and drug laws, environmental laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws, data privacy laws, human rights laws, and anti-corruption laws, among others, in and outside of the United States. Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, local and foreign government agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Labor. In particular, the processing, packaging, transportation, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation. Additionally, we are subject to data privacy and security regulations, tax and securities regulations, accounting and reporting standards, and other financial laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products.\nWe may suffer losses if changes to regulations require us to change the ingredients we use or how we process, package, transport, store, distribute, advertise, or label our products or include changes that increase our risk of liability for deceptive advertising. Moreover, depending on the implementation of such regulatory changes, we could have increased risk for a product recall or have existing inventory become unsellable, which could materially and adversely impact our product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, changes in applicable laws and regulations, including changes in taxation requirements and new or increased tariffs on products imported from certain countries, may lead to increased costs and could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we continue to monitor The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, H.R. 5376 and related regulatory developments to evaluate their potential impact on our business, tax rate, and financial results including whether we are subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. Other changes in the tax laws can significantly impact our effective tax rate and our financial results.\nOur operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, and affect our net operating revenues.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as wheat, tomatoes, and a wide array of vegetables. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.\n13\nWe may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases including increased mandatory disclosure, carbon pricing or carbon taxes. In the event that such additional regulations are enacted and are more aggressive than the climate risk mitigation measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nWhile we continue to take important steps to strive toward mitigation of climate risk and impact on climate change, transitioning our business to adapt to and comply with evolving policy, legal, and regulatory changes may impose substantial operational and compliance burdens. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Collecting, measuring and analyzing information relating to such matters can be costly, time-consuming, dependent on third-party cooperation and unreliable. Furthermore, methodologies for measuring, tracking and reporting on such matters continue to change over time, which requires our processes and controls for such data to evolve as well. Additionally, we may face increased pressure from customers, consumers, investors, activists and other stakeholders to modify our products or operations away from ingredients or activities that are considered to have a higher impact on climate change. Such changes to methodologies or lack of progress (whether actual or perceived) could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\nFrom time to time, we establish strategies and expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters. Our ability to achieve any such strategies or expectations is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include, but are not limited to, evolving regulatory and other standards, processes, and assumptions, the pace of scientific and technological developments, increased costs and the availability of requisite financing, market trends that may alter business opportunities, the conduct of third-party manufacturers and suppliers, constraint or disruptions to our supply chain, and changes in carbon markets or carbon taxes. We may be required to expend significant resources to achieve these strategies and expectations, which could significantly increase our operational costs. There can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our strategies or expectations will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving these strategies or expectations will meet customer or investor expectations. Failures or delays (whether actual or perceived) in achieving our strategies or expectations related to climate change and other environmental matters could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation, and increase risk of litigation.\nCybersecurity and Information Technology Risks\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, employee error or malfeasance, security breaches, computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, hacking, and other cyberattacks. Additionally, the increase in hybrid working where employees, including third-party employees, access technology infrastructure remotely may create additional information technology and data security risks. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a breach that had a material impact on our operations or business. Cyberattacks are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature and are becoming more sophisticated. Additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the Russia-Ukraine military conflict, has heightened the risk of cyberattacks. While we attempt to continuously monitor and mitigate against cyber risks, including through leveraging multi-sourced threat intelligence, investing in new technologies, and developing third-party cybersecurity risk management capability in support of strategic suppliers, we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents.\nSophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems, including cloud-based platforms. In addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyber-attacks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, violation of data privacy laws and regulations, litigation, and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile we maintain a cyber insurance policy that provides coverage for security incidents, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on financially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. There is no assurance that the measures we have taken to protect our information systems will prevent or limit the impact of a future cyber incident.\nAdditionally, we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and, consequently, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time.\n14\nEmployee Risks\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain, and develop qualified individuals in the locations we need. If key employees terminate their employment, our business activities may be adversely affected by shortages of personnel with the skills, knowledge and talent that we need to effectively run and grow our business. Our business activities may also be adversely affected if we are unable to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.\nWe offer robust training and development programs to help our employees develop the skills they need.  Increased employee turnover results in significant time and expense relating to identifying, recruiting, hiring, relocating and integrating qualified individuals. High employee turnover of key personnel may deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness.\nWe compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. We continue to experience increased competition for talent and at times, in recent years, have experienced periods of increased employee turnover.  If we do not successfully compete for the best talent, our business activities may be adversely affected.\nA number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us at our multiple locations or increase labor costs, including high employment levels, population migration, federal unemployment subsidies, immigration laws, and other government regulations, unemployment programs, and volatility in general macroeconomic factors impacting the labor market. Although we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, over the past few years, we have experienced a tighter and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base (or within the employee base of key suppliers or third-party manufacturers), could negatively affect our supply chain or our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business.\nOur results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor, and people-related expenses.\nOur labor costs include wages and the cost of providing employee benefits including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. The annual cost of providing these benefits varies as a result of factors such as the availability of skilled labor, the costs of health care, and the outcome of collectively bargained wage and benefit agreements. In addition, changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our wage and benefit costs, pension obligations, or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nGoodwill or Other Intangible Assets Risks\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth.\nAs of May 28, 2023, we had goodwill of $11.18 billion and other intangibles of $3.21 billion. The net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable). The net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, customer relationships, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date (or subsequent impairment date, if applicable), net of accumulated amortization. Goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. Amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as the inability to quickly replace lost co-manufacturing business, increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.), or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. Any impairment to goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively impact our net worth.\n15\nStrategic Transactions Risks\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, complete or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or investment, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives. If we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nSimilarly, we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. We may not be able to complete desired divestitures on terms favorable to us. If we do complete such desired divestitures, gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability and margins.\nMoreover, in connection with contemplated or completed acquisitions or divestitures, we may incur related asset impairment charges that reduce our profitability.  For example, in connection with our acquisition of Pinnacle Foods Inc. (\"Pinnacle\"), we incurred material charges over a multi-year period for exit and disposal activities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., recognizing charges of $2.4 million, $19.6 million, and $31.7 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nOur acquisition, joint venture and investment activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks.\nOur acquisition, joint venture and investment activities may present certain risks, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems, effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our employee population, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings, potential loss of customers or key employees, and indemnities and potential disputes with sellers, joint venture partners and investment targets. Any of these factors could affect our sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSimilarly, our divestiture activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks such as diversion of management attention from existing businesses.  Additionally, divestitures may present difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems, possible need for providing transition services to buyers, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers and others. Any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.  For example, in connection with the spinoff of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (\"Lamb Weston\"), we entered into various transition and risk allocation agreements that may give rise to disputes or be challenged by third parties seeking to hold us responsible for liabilities relating to Lamb Weston.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, licensing agreements, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights, are a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws, as well as entering into licensing, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. If we fail to adequately protect the intellectual property rights we have now or may acquire in the future, or if there occurs any change in law or otherwise that serves to reduce or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain of our intellectual property rights, including the\nP.F. Chang's\n®\n,\nBertolli\n®\n, and\nLibby's\n®\ntrademarks, are owned by third parties and licensed to us, and others, such as\nAlexia\n®\n, are owned by us and licensed to third parties. While many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature, others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms. If in the future we are unable to renew such a licensing arrangement pursuant to its terms and conditions, or if we fail to renegotiate such a licensing arrangement, then our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere is also a risk that other parties may have intellectual property rights covering some of our brands, products, or technology. If any third parties bring a claim of intellectual property infringement against us, we may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation, diverting the attention of management and our employees. If we are unsuccessful in defending against such claims, we may be subject to, among other things, significant damages, injunctions against development and sale of certain products, or we may be required to enter into costly licensing agreements, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations."

Results for fiscal 2023 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.\n20\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nConagra Brands, headquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as\nBirds Eye\n®\n,\nMarie Callender's\n®\n,\nDuncan Hines\n®\n,\nHealthy Choice\n®\n,\nSlim Jim\n®\n, and\nReddi-wip\n®\n, as well as emerging brands, including\nAngie's\n®\nBOOMCHICKAPOP\n®\n,\nDuke's\n®\n,\nEarth Balance\n®\n,\nGardein\n®\n, and\nFrontera\n®\n, offer choices for every occasion.\nFiscal 2023 Results\nFiscal 2023 performance compared to fiscal 2022 reflected an increase in net sales, with organic (excludes the impacts of foreign exchange) increases in all of our operating segments. Overall gross profit increased primarily as a result of higher net sales, productivity, and lower transportation costs, which were partially offset by input cost inflation, unfavorable operating leverage, and elevated supply chain operating costs. Excluding items impacting comparability, overall segment operating profit increased in all of our operating segments. Corporate expenses were higher primarily due to items impacting comparability, as discussed below, in addition to higher share-based payment expense. Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were also higher due to items impacting comparability, in addition to higher advertising and promotional expenses. We recognized higher equity method investment earnings, higher interest expense, and lower income tax expense, in each case compared to fiscal 2022. Excluding items impacting comparability, our effective tax rate was slightly higher compared to fiscal 2022.\nDiluted earnings per share were $1.42 and $1.84 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Diluted earnings per share were affected by lower net income as well as several significant items affecting the comparability of year-over-year results (see\n\"Items Impacting Comparability\"\nbelow).\nTrends Impacting our Business\nDuring fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, our industry has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, commodity cost fluctuations, labor market issues, input cost inflation, and other global macroeconomic challenges. While we continued to experience significant input cost inflation throughout fiscal 2023, our pricing actions and supply chain productivity assisted in a 198-basis point recovery to gross margin. While we are seeing some moderation in input cost inflation, we do expect inflationary pressures to persist into fiscal 2024. However, we anticipate continued supply chain productivity and previously implemented pricing actions to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.\nItems Impacting Comparability\nItems of note impacting comparability of results for fiscal 2023 included the following:\n21\nItems of note impacting comparability of results for fiscal 2022 included the following:\nSegment presentation of gains and losses from derivatives used for economic hedging of anticipated commodity input costs and economic hedging of foreign currency exchange rate risks of anticipated transactions are discussed in the segment review below.\n22\nSEGMENT REVIEW\nWe reflect our results of operations in four reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice.\nGrocery & Snacks\nThe Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\n23\nRefrigerated & Frozen\nThe Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment principally includes branded, temperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\nInternational\nThe International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.\nFoodservice\nThe Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products that are packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.\nPresentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results\nDerivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are generally recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately. See Note 19,\n\"Business Segments and Related Information\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for further discussion.\nPresentation of Information\nBelow is a detailed discussion and comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022. For a discussion of changes from the fiscal year ended May 30, 2021 to the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7,\nManagement\n’\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022 (filed July 21, 2022).\nFiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022\nNet Sales\nNet sales for fiscal 2023 in our Grocery & Snacks segment included an increase in price/mix of 15% compared to fiscal 2022\ndue to\nfavorability in inflation-driven pricing\n. V\nolumes decreased by 9% compared to fiscal 2022.\nThis result\nwas primarily due to the elasticity impact from inflation-driven pricing actions and shortages from supply chain disruptions\n. In fiscal 2023,\nwe had a product recall primarily related to our\nArmour Star\n® brand, which resulted in a $7.8 million reduction to net sales for customer returns and fees in addition to estimated lost sales of approximately $40 million.\n24\nNet sales for fiscal 2023 in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment included an increase in price/mix of 13% compared to fiscal 2022\ndue to\nfavorability in inflation-driven pricing. Volumes decreased by 7% compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the elasticity impact from inflation-driven pricing actions and shortages from supply chain disruptions.\nNet sales for fiscal 2023 in our International segment reflected a 13% increase in price/mix, an 8% decrease in volumes, and a 2% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, in each case compared to fiscal 2022.\nThe increase in price/mix was primarily due to favorability in inflation-driven pricing.\nThe decrease in volumes was driven by the elasticity impact from inflation-driven pricing actions.\nNet sales for fiscal 2023 in our Foodservice segment included an increase in price/mix of 16% compared to fiscal 2022, reflecting inflation-driven pricing. Volumes decreased by 3% compared to fiscal 2022. The decrease in volumes was driven by the elasticity impact from inflation-driven pricing actions.\nSG&A Expenses (Includes general corporate expenses)\nSG&A expenses totaled $2.19 billion for fiscal 2023, an increase of $696.7 million compared to fiscal 2022. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2023 reflected the following:\nItems impacting comparability of earnings\nOther changes in expenses compared to fiscal 2022\n25\nSG&A expenses for fiscal 2022 included the following items impacting the comparability of earnings:\nSegment Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expenses, pension and postretirement non-service income, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings)\n26\nOperating profit in our Grocery & Snacks segment for fiscal 2023 reflected an increase in gross profits of $154.2 million compared to fiscal 2022. The higher gross profit was driven by the net sales growth discussed above, productivity, and lower transportation costs, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost leverage, higher inventory reserves, and continued elevated supply chain operating costs. The increase in gross profits was partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, including an increase of $17.3 in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Grocery & Snacks segment included certain brand intangible impairment charges of $78.9 million and $90.7 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 included charges of $0.6 million and $9.4 million, respectively, related to our restructuring plans. Fiscal 2023 included expenses of $3.5 million related to a municipal water break that impacted one of our production facilities. Fiscal 2022 included charges of $26.3 million related to the impairment of businesses previously held for sale. Operating profit for fiscal 2023 in our Grocery & Snacks segment was impacted by $7.8 million in charges related to our product recall, discussed above, in addition to estimated lost profits of approximately $14 million.\nOperating profit in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment for fiscal 2023 reflected an increase in gross profits of $257.8 million compared to fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by the net sales growth discussed above, productivity, and lower transportation costs, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost leverage, and continued elevated supply chain operating costs. The increase in gross profits was partially offset by higher SG&A expenses, including an increase of $26.8 million in advertising and promotion expenses. Operating profit of the Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted by charges of $252.6 million and $103.9 million related to the impairment of certain brand intangible assets as part of our annual impairment testing during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fiscal 2023 also included charges of $385.7 million related to the goodwill and\nBirds Eye\n® brand impairments in connection with certain reporting unit changes within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 included $5.1 million and $14.5 million, respectively, of charges related to our restructuring plans and $15.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in charges associated with fires occurring at certain of our manufacturing facilities. Operating profit in fiscal 2023 was also impacted by $4.2 million of incremental transportation costs and inventory write-offs as a result of supply chain disruptions caused by a third-party vendor’s system shutdown in connection with the third party experiencing a cybersecurity incident. Operating profit in fiscal 2022 included $28.9 million of charges related to the impairment of businesses previously held for sale.\nOperating profit in our International segment for fiscal 2023 reflected an increase in gross profits of $21.4 compared to fiscal 2022, reflecting the net sales growth discussed above and productivity, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost leverage, and elevated supply chain operating costs. Operating profit of the International segment was impacted by charges of $13.7 million and $14.4 million related to the impairment of certain brand intangible assets during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOperating profit in our Foodservice segment for fiscal 2023 reflected an increase in gross profits of $34.1 million compared to fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit was driven by the net sales growth discussed above and productivity, partially offset by the impacts of input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost leverage, and elevated supply chain operating costs. Operating profit in fiscal 2023 and 2022 included expense of $20.5 million and $14.9 million, respectively, related to the impairment of businesses previously held for sale. In addition, fiscal 2023 and 2022 were impacted by a net benefit of $1.9 million and charges of $7.6 million, respectively, associated with fires occurring at certain of our manufacturing facilities and related insurance recoveries.\nPension and Postretirement Non-service Income\nIn fiscal 2023, pension and postretirement non-service income was $24.2 million, a decrease of $43.1 million compared to fiscal 2022.\nFiscal 2023 reflected higher interest costs.\nInterest Expense, Net\nIn fiscal 2023, net interest expense was $409.6 million, an increase of $29.7 million, or 7.8%, from fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by a higher weighted average interest rate on outs\ntanding debt. See Note 3,\n\"Long-Term Debt\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense was $218.7 million and $290.5 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity met\nhod investment earnings) was approximately 24% and 25% for fiscal\n2023\nand\n2022\n, respectively. See Note 13,\n\"Pre-Tax Income and Income Taxes\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for a discussion on the change in effective tax rates.\n27\nWe expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2024, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately\n24%\n.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nWe include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Our most significant affiliate is the Ardent Mills joint venture. Our share of earnings\nfrom our equity method investment earnings were\n$212.0\nmillion and\n$145.3\nmillion for fiscal\n2023\nand\n2022\n, respectively. Ardent Mills earnings for fiscal 2023 reflected favorable market conditions, including the joint venture’s continued effective management through the recent volatility in the wheat markets.\nEarnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023 and 2022 were $1.42 and $1.84, respectively. The decrease in diluted earnings per share reflected lower net income. See\n\"Items Impacting Comparability\"\nabove as several significant items affected the comparability of year-over-year results of operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources of Liquidity and Capital\nThe primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We use short-term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We strive to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings.\nManagement believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, our commercial paper program, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, other contractual obligations, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter.\nBorrowing Facilities and Long-Term Debt\nAt May 28, 2023, we had a revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $2.0 billion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion with the consent of the lenders). The Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 26, 2027 and is unsecured. The Company may request the term of the Revolving Credit Facility be extended for additional one-year or two-year periods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. We have historically used a credit facility principally as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of May 28, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe had $576.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of May 28, 2023, and $180.0 million outstanding as of May 29, 2022. The highest level of borrowings during fiscal 2023 was $718.0 million.\nWe repaid the remaining outstanding $437.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.20% senior notes on their maturity date of January 25, 2023. The repayment was primarily funded by the issuance of commercial paper. We have $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.500% senior notes maturing on August 11, 2023 that we expect to repay with long-term debt and/or cash on hand.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into an unsecured Term Loan Agreement (the \"Term Loan Agreement\") with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Term Loan Agreement provides for delayed draw term loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million. The Term Loan Agreement matures on August 26, 2025. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we borrowed the full $500.0 million aggregate principal amount available under the Term Loan Agreement. The proceeds were used to repay the full outstanding $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.25% senior notes on their maturity date of September 15, 2022 as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program.\n28\nAdditional information about our long-term debt balances as of May 28, 2023 can be found in Note 3,\n\"Long-Term Debt\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. The weighted-average coupon interest rate of the long-term debt obligations outstanding as of May 28, 2023, was approximately 4.6%.\nWe expect to maintain or have access to sufficient liquidity to retire or refinance long-term debt at maturity or otherwise, from operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, access to the capital markets, and our Revolving Credit Facility. We continuously evaluate opportunities to refinance our debt; however, any refinancing is subject to market conditions and other factors, including financing options that may be available to us from time to time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully refinance any debt on commercially acceptable terms at all.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2023, our senior long-term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult, or impossible.\nOur most restrictive debt agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility) generally requires our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense not be less than 3.0 to 1.0 and our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA not to exceed 4.5 to 1.0. Each ratio is to be calculated on a rolling four-quarter basis. As of May 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial covenants.\nEquity and Dividends\nWe repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board. Under our current share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase authorization has no expiration date. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our common stock under this authorization for an aggregate of $150.0 million. The Company’s total remaining share repurchase authorization as of May 28, 2023, was $916.6 million.\nOn April 12, 2023, we announced that our Board had authorized a quarterly dividend payment of $0.33 per share, which was paid on June 1, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 28, 2023. Subsequent to our fiscal year end, on July 12, 2023, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share to be paid on August 31, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 31, 2023, which represents a 6% increase to our annualized dividend rate.\nContractual Obligations\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt and notes payable balances, discussed above, our contractual obligations primarily consist of lease payments, income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and unconditional purchase obligations.\nA summary of our operating and finance lease obligations as of May 28, 2023 can be found in Note 14,\n\"Leases\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\nThe liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was $23.7 million as of May 28, 2023. See Note 13,\n\"Pre-Tax Income and Income Taxes\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for information related to income taxes.\nAs of May 28, 2023, we had an aggregate funded pension asset of $148.3 million and an aggregate unfunded postretirement benefit obligation totaling $49.7 million. We expect to make payments totaling approximately $12.1 million and $7.2 million in fiscal 2024 to fund our pension and postretirement plans, respectively. See Note 17,\n\"Pension and Postretirement Benefits\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and\n\"Critical Accounting Estimates\n–\nEmployee-Related Benefits\"\ncontained in this report for further discussion of our pension obligation and factors that could affect estimates of these obligations.\n29\nAs of May 28, 2023, our unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future\nfor fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as \"take-or-pay\" contracts) totaled approx\nimately $2.58 billion. Approximately $1.72 billion o\nf this balance is due in fiscal 2024. Included in this amount are open purchase orders and other supply agreements totaling appr\noximately $1.45 billion, wh\nich are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year. Warehousing service agreements totaling approximately\n$629 million\nmake up a majority of our remaining unconditional purchase obligations with various terms of up to 10 years.\nWe expect to have sufficient cash flows from the above cited sources to meet the material cash requirements of these contractual obligations as they become settleable in the ordinary course of business.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe continue to make investments in our business and operating facilities. Our preliminary estimate of capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 is approximately $500 million.\nSupplier Arrangements\nCertain suppliers have access to third-party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. These third-party services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. Balances remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements and are either reflected in accounts payable or in notes payable within our Consolidated Balance Sheets depending on the nature of the arrangement. The associated payments are included in net cash flows from operating activities for those balances reflected in accounts payable, whereas the proceeds and payments associated with short-term borrowings are reflected as financing activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, $355.1 million and $378.3 million, respectively, of our total accounts payable was payable to suppliers who utilize these third-party services. As of May 28, 2023, we also had approximately $62.5 million of short-term borrowings related to these arrangements.\nThe program commenced at about the same time that we began an initiative to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. A number of factors may impact our future payment terms, including our relative creditworthiness, overall market liquidity, and changes in interest rates and other general economic conditions.\nCash Flows\nIn fiscal 2023, we generated $10.6 million of cash, which was the net result of $995.4 million generated from operating activities, $354.9 million used in investing activities, $631.6 million used in financing activities, and an increase of $1.7 million due to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCash generated from operating activities totaled $995.4 million in fiscal 2023, as compared to $1.18 billion generated in fiscal 2022. While we had higher gross profits in fiscal 2023, the decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by changes in working capital, which were negatively impacted by the timing of payments of accounts payable, higher inventory balances, due in part to input cost inflation, and increased tax and interest payments.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $354.9 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $434.9 million in fiscal 2022. Net cash outflows from investing activities in fiscal 2023 and 2022 consisted primarily of capital expenditures totaling $362.2 million and $464.4 million, respectively.\nCash used in financing activities totaled $631.6 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $738.0 million in fiscal 2022. Financing activities in fiscal 2023 principally reflected repayments of long-term debt of $712.4 million, the issuance of long-term debt totaling $500.0 million, net short-term borrowing issuances of $351.4 million, cash dividends paid of $623.8 million, and common stock repurchases of $150.0 million. Financing activities in fiscal 2022 reflected net proceeds of $499.1 million from the issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, net short-term borrowing repayments of $523.1 million, cash dividends paid of $581.8 million, and common stock repurchases of $50.0 million.\n30\nCash Held by International Subsidiaries\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $93.9 million at May 28, 2023, and $83.3 million at May 29, 2022, of which $85.5 million at May 28, 2023, and $74.7 million at May 29, 2022, was held in foreign countries. A deferred tax liability is provided for certain undistributed foreign earnings in fiscal 2023 that are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested or cannot be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Other undistributed foreign earnings are invested indefinitely and therefore we have not provided deferred taxes on those earnings.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with management's understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management.\nOur Audit/Finance Committee has reviewed management's development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.\nMarketing Costs\n—We offer various forms of trade promotions which are mostly recorded as a reduction in revenue. The methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance. Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\nWe have recognized trade promotion liabilities of $125.7 million as of May 28, 2023. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\n—Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long-range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\nFurther information on income taxes is provided in Note 13,\n\"Pre-tax Income and Income Taxes\"\n, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\n31\nEmployee-Related Benefits\n—We incur certain employment-related expenses associated with our pension plans. In order to measure the annual expense associated with these pension benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, employee turnover rates, and anticipated mortality rates. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these pension benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time.\nThe Company uses a split discount rate (the \"spot-rate approach\") for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans. The spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost.\nWe have recognized a pension liability of $101.6 million and $114.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also have recognized a pension asset of $249.9 million and $277.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, as certain individual plans of the Company had a positive funded status.\nWe recognize cumulative changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (\"the corridor\") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nWe recognized a pension benefit from Company plans of $13.9 million, $54.4 million, and $38.3 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Such amounts reflect the year-end write-off of actuarial losses (gains) in excess of 10% of our pension liability of $0.1 million, $(2.9) million, and $0.8 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. This also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $145.9 million, $145.4 million, and $140.0 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We contributed $12.5 million, $11.5 million, and $27.6 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $12.1 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2024.\nOne significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. We use a spot-rate approach, discussed above. This approach focuses on measuring the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rates derived from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve and matched with separate cash flows for each future year instead of a single weighted-average discount rate approach.\nBased on this information, the weighted-average discount rate selected by us for determination of the interest cost component of our pension\nexpense was 4.09% for fiscal\n2023\n, 2.29% for fiscal\n2022\n, and 2.30% for fiscal 2021. The weighted-average discount rate selected by us for determination of the service cost component of our pension expense was 4.74% for fiscal 2023, 3.50% for fiscal 2022, and 3.35% for fiscal 2021. We selected a weighted-average discount rate o\nf 5.64% and 5.44% f\nor determination of service and interest expense, respectively, for fiscal 2024. A 25-basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal\n2023\nwould increase our annual pension expense for our pension plans in fiscal 2023 by\n$2.6 milli\non. A 25-basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal\n2023\nwould decrease our annual pension expense for our pension plans in fiscal 2023 by\n$2.8 mill\nion. F\nor our year-end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of 5.50% and 4.48% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAnother significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan's investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long-term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, we selected 4.56% for the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2023 pension expense. A 25-basis point increase/decrease in our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2023 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by $8.0 mi\nllion.\nA 25-basis point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2024\nwould decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans\nby $7.1 m\nillion.\nWe selected a weighted-average expected rate of return on p\nlan assets o\nf 5.01%\nto be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2024.\n32\nBusiness Combinations, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Identifiable Intangible Assets, and Goodwill\n—We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions we normally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nWe reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived assets to their fair values when their carrying amount is determined to not be recoverable. We generally compare undiscounted estimated future cash flows of an asset or asset group to the carrying values of the asset or asset group for property, plant and equipment. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the asset or asset group, no impairment is recognized. If the undiscounted estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the asset or asset group, we write-down the asset or assets to their estimated fair values. The estimates of fair value are generally in the form of appraisal, or by discounting estimated future cash flows of the asset or asset group.\nDetermining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires management judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. The costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life.\nWe reduce the carrying amounts of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets. For further information on our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, see Note 1, “\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\nAs of May 28, 2023, we have goodwill of $11.18 billion, indefinite-lived intangibles of $2.47 billion and definite-lived intangibles of $735.3 million. Historically, we have experienced impairments in brand intangibles and goodwill as a result of declining sales, reductions to our assumed royalty rates due to lower-than-expected profit margins, and other economic conditions such as increases to interest rates. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded goodwill impairments of $141.7 million in our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit. The carrying value of goodwill in our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit was approximately $3.3 billion as of our fiscal 2023 annual impairment testing date and was the only reporting unit with 10% or less excess fair value over carrying value as of that date. For our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit, we selected a discount rate of 7.75% and a long-term growth rate that approximated 1%.\nIn fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded total intangibles impairments of $589.2 million, $209.0 million, and $90.9 million, respectively, primarily related to brands acquired as part of the Pinnacle acquisition that were recorded at fair value in fiscal 2019. We continue to be more susceptible to impairment charges in the future if our long-term sales forecasts, royalty rates, and other assumptions change as a result of lower than expected performance or other economic conditions. We will monitor these assumptions as management continues to achieve gross margin improvement and long-term sales growth. Discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates used to estimate the fair value of our domestic retail brands with 10% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the fiscal 2023 annual impairment test were as follows:\n33\nAssumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based upon the facts and circumstances present at each annual impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation. However, as it is reasonably possible that changes in assumptions could occur, as a sensitivity measure, we have presented the estimated effects of isolated changes in discount rates, long-term growth rates, and royalty rates on the fair value of our reporting unit and brands with 10% or less excess fair value over carrying amount. These estimated changes in fair value are not necessarily representative of the actual impairment that would be recorded in the event of a fair value decline.\nIf we had changed the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit and brands with 10% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of the fiscal 2023 annual impairment test, these isolated changes, which are reasonably possible to occur, would have led to the following increase/(decrease) in the aggregate fair value of this reporting unit and certain brands (in millions):\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2022-04,\nSupplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,\nto add disclosure requirements related to supplier financing programs under Accounting Standards Codification 405,\nLiabilities\n. The guidance requires entities that maintain supplier financing programs to provide information in their financial statements about their use of supplier finance programs and their effect on the entity's working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Specifically, the amendment requires entities to disclose the key terms of their programs, amounts outstanding, balance sheet presentation, and a roll-forward of amounts outstanding during the annual period. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period is required to be disclosed in interim periods. The ASU will be effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, except for the roll-forward requirement, which is effective in fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted. We are reviewing the provisions of this new pronouncement but do not expect this ASU to have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures."

    "text": "The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2023 and 2022 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies.\nCommodity Market Risk\nWe purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, vegetable oils, pork, dairy products, and energy to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded transactions.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt.\nAs of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, the fair value of our long-term debt (including current installments) was estimated at $8.31 billion and $8.85 billion, respectively, based on current market rates. As of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $392.8 million and $481.8 million, respectively, while a 1% decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $441.7 million and $543.4 million, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.\nEffect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation\nThe potential gain or loss on the fair value of our outstanding commodity and foreign exchange contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, would have been (in millions):\n34\nIt should be noted that any change in the fair value of our derivative contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar.\n35"

(\"Conagra Brands\", \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") ends the last Sunday in\nMay.\nThe fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements presented consist of a\n52\n-week period for fiscal\n2023\n,\n2022\n, and\n2021\n.\nBasis of Consolidation\n— The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Conagra Brands, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany investments, accounts, and transactions have been eliminated.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\n— The investments in, and the operating results of,\n50%\n-or-less-owned entities\nnot\nrequired to be consolidated are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity method of accounting.\nWe review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments\nmay\nnot\nbe fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary includes, but is\nnot\nlimited to, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment, or, where applicable, estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment. Management's assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary. Management generally considers our investments in equity method investees to be strategic long-term investments. Therefore, management completes its assessments with a long-term viewpoint. If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an appropriate write-down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n— Cash and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of\nthree\nmonths or less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time deposits and government agency and corporate obligations, are classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nReceivables\n— Receivables from customers generally do\nnot\nbear interest. Terms and collection vary by location and channel. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem them uncollectible.\nThe following table details the balances of our allowance for doubtful accounts and changes therein:\n1\nPrimarily relates to translation and the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\")\n2016\n-\n13.\n2\nBad debts charged off and adjustments to previous reserves, less recoveries.\nInventories\n— We use the lower of cost (determined using the\nfirst\n-in,\nfirst\n-out method) or net realizable value for valuing inventories.\n41\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n— Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows:\nWe review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets\nmay\nnot\nbe fully recoverable. Recoverability of an asset considered \"held-and-used\" is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, the asset's carrying amount is reduced to its estimated fair value. An asset considered \"held-for-sale\" is reported at the lower of the asset's carrying amount or fair value.\nDuring fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, our capital expenditures totaled $\n362.2\nmillion, $\n464.4\nmillion, and $\n506.4\nmillion, respectively. Accrued and unpaid capital expenditures as of\nMay 28, 2023\n,\nMay 29, 2022\n,\nMay 30, 2021\n, and\nMay 31, 2020\ntotaled $\n128.3\nmillion, $\n108.8\nmillion, $\n123.7\nmillion, and $\n112.9\nmillion, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets\n— Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are\nnot\namortized and are tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset\nmay\nbe impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators\nmay\ninclude deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction\nmay\ndiffer from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIn testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to\nfirst\nassess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than\nnot\n(more than\n50%\n) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more likely than\nnot,\nwe are then required to perform a quantitative impairment test, otherwise\nno\nfurther analysis is required. We also\nmay\nelect\nnot\nto perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.\nUnder the goodwill qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.\nUnder the goodwill quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value using level\n3\ninputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note\n18\nfor the definition of the levels in the fair value hierarchy. The inputs used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective factors, such as estimates of future cash flows, estimates of our future cost structure, discount rates for our estimated cash flows, required level of working capital, assumed terminal value, and time horizon of cash flow forecasts.\nIn assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets\nnot\nsubject to amortization for impairment, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is\nnot\nmore likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we are\nnot\nrequired to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment. However, if we conclude otherwise or elect\nnot\nto perform the qualitative assessment, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\n42\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nIn fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\nwe elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets\nnot\nsubject to amortization. The estimates of fair value of intangible assets\nnot\nsubject to amortization are determined using a \"relief from royalty\" methodology, which is used in estimating the fair value of our brands/trademarks. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. Also subject to judgment are assumptions about royalty rates.\nIdentifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g., licensing arrangements with contractual lives or customer relationships) are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset\nmay\nbe impaired. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating elements of property, plant and equipment. If impaired, the asset is written down to its fair value.\nRefer to Note\n7\nfor discussion of the impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\n— Unless otherwise specified, we believe the carrying value of financial instruments approximates their fair value.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\n— Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. We use\nthird\n-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the obligations associated with environmental liabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. We do\nnot\ndiscount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is\nnot\nfixed or readily determinable. Management's estimate of our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. We do\nnot\nreduce our environmental liabilities for potential insurance recoveries.\nEmployment-Related Benefits\n— Employment-related benefits associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers' compensation are expensed as such obligations are incurred. The recognition of expense is impacted by estimates made by management, such as discount rates used to value these liabilities, future health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but\nnot\nyet reported. We use\nthird\n-party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the obligations associated with employment-related benefits.\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of pension plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of\n10%\nof the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (the \"corridor\") in current period expense annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when measurement is required otherwise under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nRevenue Recognition\n— Our revenues primarily consist of the sale of food products that are sold to retailers and foodservice customers through direct sales forces, broker, and distributor arrangements. These revenue contracts generally have single performance obligations. Revenue, which includes shipping and handling charges billed to the customer, is reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including applicable discounts, returns, allowances, trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption, unsaleable product, and other costs. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-term basis and, therefore, we do\nnot\nhave any significant financing components.\nWe recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the goods to customers. Control is transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer. Shipping and/or handling costs that occur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed to be fulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs. We assess the goods and services promised in our customers' purchase orders and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services) that is distinct.\n43\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nWe offer various forms of trade promotions and the methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on local customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to provisions based on actual occurrence or performance. Our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, and loyalty programs. The costs of these activities are recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. These estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\nAdvertising Costs\n— Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $\n290.1\nmillion, $\n244.6\nmillion, and $\n258.0\nmillion in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses.\nResearch and Development\n— We incurred expenses of $\n57.7\nmillion, $\n53.4\nmillion, and $\n51.3\nmillion for research and development activities in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nComprehensive Income\n— Comprehensive income includes net income, currency translation adjustments, certain derivative-related activity, and changes in prior service cost and net actuarial gains (losses) from pension (for amounts\nnot\nin excess of the\n10%\n\"corridor\") and postretirement health care plans. On foreign investments we deem to be essentially permanent in nature, we do\nnot\nprovide for taxes on currency translation adjustments arising from converting an investment denominated in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. A deferred tax liability is recorded on currency translation adjustments related to undistributed foreign earnings that are\nnot\ndeemed to be permanently reinvested.\nThe following table details the accumulated balances for each component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\n44\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes the reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into income:\n1\nAmounts in parentheses indicate income recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nForeign Currency Transaction Gains and Losses\n— We recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $\n2.8\nmillion and $\n2.5\nmillion in fiscal\n2023\nand\n2022\n, respectively, and net foreign currency transaction gains of $\n8.2\nmillion in fiscal\n2021\nin SG&A expenses.\nBusiness Combinations\n— We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition.

Although we remain unable to make good faith estimates relating to the entire Conagra Restructuring Plan, we are reporting on actions initiated through the end of fiscal\n2023\n, including the estimated amounts or range of amounts for each major type of costs expected to be incurred, and the charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n, we had approved the incurrence of $\n186.4\nmillion ($\n58.6\nmillion of cash charges and $\n127.8\nmillion of non-cash charges) for several projects associated with the Conagra Restructuring Plan. We have incurred or expect to incur $\n156.3\nmillion of charges ($\n53.0\nmillion of cash charges and $\n103.3\nmillion of non-cash charges) for actions identified to date under the Conagra Restructuring Plan. We recognized charges of $\n10.7\nmillion, $\n29.4\nmillion, and $\n46.2\nmillion in connection with the Conagra Restructuring Plan in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. We expect to incur costs related to the Conagra Restructuring Plan over a multi-year period.\n46\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nWe anticipate that we will recognize the following pre-tax expenses in association with the Conagra Restructuring Plan (amounts include charges recognized from plan inception through the end of fiscal\n2023\n):\nDuring fiscal\n2023\n, we recognized the following pre-tax expenses for the Conagra Restructuring Plan:\nIncluded in the above results are $\n9.6\nmillion of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $\n1.1\nmillion in non-cash charges.\n47\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nWe recognized the following cumulative (plan inception to\nMay 28, 2023\n) pre-tax expenses for the Conagra Restructuring Plan in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings:\nIncluded in the above results are $\n49.8\nmillion of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $\n103.1\nmillion in non-cash charges.\nLiabilities recorded for the Conagra Restructuring Plan and changes therein for fiscal\n2023\nwere as follows:\n48\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nPinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan\nAs of the end of the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nwe had substantially completed our restructuring and integration plan related to our acquisition of Pinnacle Foods, Inc. (\"Pinnacle\") in\n2018\nfor the purpose of achieving significant cost synergies (the \"Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan\"). We recognized charges of $\n2.4\nmillion, $\n19.6\nmillion, and $\n31.7\nmillion in connection with the Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan in fiscal\n2023\n,\n2022\n, and\n2021\n, respectively.\nWe had recognized $\n295.7\nmillion in pre-tax expenses ($\n13.0\nmillion in cost of goods sold and $\n282.7\nmillion in SG&A expenses) from the inception of this plan through\nMay 28, 2023\n. Included in these results were $\n267.6\nmillion of cash charges and $\n28.1\nmillion of non-cash charges. Our total pre-tax expenses for the Pinnacle Integration Restructuring Plan are expected to be $\n340.7\nmillion ($\n280.1\nmillion of cash charges and $\n60.6\nmillion of non-cash charges). The remaining charges relate primarily to certain leased facilities that are\nnot\nexpected to be used in their current capacity through the contractual lease term.\n3.\nLONG-TERM DEBT\nThe aggregate minimum principal maturities of the long-term debt for each of the\nfive\nfiscal years following\nMay 28, 2023\n, are as follows:\nIn the\nthird\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nwe repaid the remaining outstanding $\n437.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n3.20\n% senior notes on their maturity date of\nJanuary 25, 2023.\nThe repayment was primarily funded by the issuance of commercial paper.\nIn the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nwe entered into an unsecured Term Loan Agreement (the \"Term Loan Agreement\") with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Term Loan Agreement provided for delayed draw term loans to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n500.0\nmillion. The Term Loan Agreement matures on\nAugust 26, 2025.\nDuring the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nwe borrowed the full $\n500.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount available under the Term Loan Agreement. The proceeds were used to repay the full outstanding $\n250.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n3.25\n% senior notes on their maturity date of\nSeptember 15, 2022,\nas well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at the sum of Term SOFR (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), plus a\n0.10\n% per annum rate spread adjustment, plus a percentage spread (ranging from\n0.90\n% per annum to\n1.375\n% per annum) based on the Company's senior unsecured long-term indebtedness ratings. The Company\nmay\nvoluntarily prepay term loans under the Term Loan Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions.\nIn the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2022,\nwe issued $\n500.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n0.500\n% senior notes due\nAugust 11, 2023.\nIn the\nfourth\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe repaid the remaining outstanding\n    $\n195.9\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n9.75\n% subordinated notes on the maturity date of\nMarch 1, 2021.\n49\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nIn the\nthird\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe redeemed\n    $\n400.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n3.20\n% senior notes due\nJanuary 25, 2023,\nprior to maturity, resulting in a loss of\n    $\n24.4\nmillion within SG&A expenses as a cost of early extinguishment of debt.\nIn the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe issued\n    $\n1.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n1.375\n% senior notes due\nNovember 1, 2027 (\nthe\n\"2027\nSenior Notes\"). We also redeemed the entire outstanding\n    $\n1.20\nbillion aggregate principal amount of our\n3.80\n% senior notes prior to their maturity date of\nOctober 22, 2021,\nresulting in a net loss of\n    $\n44.3\nmillion within SG&A expenses as a cost of early extinguishment of debt. This redemption was primarily funded using the net proceeds from the issuance of the\n2027\nSenior Notes.\nIn the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe also repaid the entire outstanding $\n500.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our floating rate notes on the maturity date of\nOctober 9, 2020.\nIn the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe repaid the remaining outstanding $\n126.6\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n4.95\n% senior notes on their maturity date of\nAugust 15, 2020.\nNet interest expense consists of:\nIn the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2019,\nwe entered into deal-contingent forward starting interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to our anticipated issuance of long-term debt to help finance the Pinnacle acquisition. During the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2019,\nwe terminated the interest rate swap contracts and received proceeds of $\n47.5\nmillion. This gain was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the lives of the related debt instruments. Our net interest expense was reduced by $\n3.4\nmillion, $\n3.3\nmillion, and $\n3.3\nmillion in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively, due to the impact of these interest rate swap contracts.\nInterest paid was $\n416.3\nmillion, $\n393.9\nmillion, and $\n445.6\nmillion in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\n4.\nCREDIT FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS\nIn the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nwe entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\") with a syndicate of financial institutions providing for a revolving credit facility in a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any\none\ntime of $\n2.0\nbillion (subject to increase to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $\n2.5\nbillion with the consent of the lenders). The revolving credit facility provided for under the Revolving Credit Agreement replaced the Company's revolving credit facility under the prior revolving credit agreement, which was terminated. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on\nAugust\n26,\n2027\nand is unsecured. The term of the Revolving Credit Agreement\nmay\nbe extended for additional\none\n-year or\ntwo\n-year periods from the then-applicable maturity date on an annual basis. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains events of default customary for unsecured investment grade credit facilities with corresponding grace periods. The Revolving Credit Agreement generally requires our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") to interest expense\nnot\nto be less than\n3.0\nto\n1.0\nand our ratio of funded debt to EBITDA\nnot\nto exceed\n4.5\nto\n1.0,\nwith each ratio to be calculated on a rolling\nfour\n-quarter basis. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nWe finance our short-term liquidity needs with existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, and commercial paper borrowings. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n, we had $\n576.0\nmillion outstanding under our commercial paper program at an average weighted interest rate of\n5.70\n%. As of\nMay 29, 2022\n, we had $\n180.0\nmillion outstanding under our commercial paper program at an average weighted interest rate of\n1.41\n%.\nWe enter into various supplier financing arrangements to facilitate supply from our vendors. Balance sheet classification is based on the nature of the arrangement and amounts are classified as either Accounts payable or Notes payable within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have concluded that certain obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are impacted by\nthird\n-party service programs and therefore we have classified certain amounts outstanding under these programs as Notes payable. We had approximately $\n62.5\nmillion of short-term borrowings as of\nMay 28, 2023\nrelated to these arrangements.\n50\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n5.\nDIVESTITURES AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\nDivestitures\nDuring the\nfourth\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe completed the sale of our\nEgg Beaters\n®\nbusiness for net proceeds of $\n50.7\nmillion. The business results were previously reported primarily within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and to a lesser extent within our International and Foodservice segments. We recognized a gain on the sale of $\n10.4\nmillion, included within SG&A expenses. In connection with the sale of our\nEgg Beaters\n®\nbusiness, we also recognized a loss of $\n7.1\nmillion within SG&A expenses related to the early exit of an unfavorable contract.\nDuring the\nthird\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe completed the sale of our\nPeter Pan\n®\npeanut butter business for net proceeds of $\n101.5\nmillion. The business results were previously reported primarily within our Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within our International and Foodservice segments. We recognized a gain on the sale of $\n49.8\nmillion, included within SG&A expenses.\nDuring the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\nwe completed the sale of our\nH.K. Anderson\n®\nbusiness for net proceeds of $\n8.7\nmillion. The business results were previously reported in our Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within our Foodservice segment. We recognized a gain on the sale of $\n5.3\nmillion, included within SG&A expenses.\nOther Assets Held for Sale\nDuring the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2022,\nwe initiated a plan to sell businesses with operating results included within our Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, and Foodservice segments. In connection with this activity, we recognized impairment charges of $\n70.1\nmillion and $\n26.7\nmillion within SG&A expenses in fiscal\n2022\nand\n2023,\nrespectively. During the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nit was determined that these assets and liabilities previously presented as assets and liabilities held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets\nno\nlonger met the held for sale criteria. Assets of $\n58.9\nmillion and liabilities of $\n4.1\nmillion as of\nMay 29, 2022\nhave been reclassified to assets and liabilities held and used.\n51\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n6.\nINVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES\nThe total carrying value of our equity method investments at the end of fiscal\n2023\nand\n2022\nwas $\n998.4\nmillion and $\n918.3\nmillion, respectively. These amounts are included in other assets and reflect our\n44\n% ownership interest in Ardent Mills and a\n50\n% ownership interest in\none\nother joint venture. Due to differences in fiscal reporting periods, we recognized the equity method investment earnings on a lag of approximately\none\nmonth.\nIn fiscal\n2023\n, we had purchases from our equity method investees of $\n30.8\nmillion. Total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal\n2023\nwere $\n138.4\nmillion.\nIn fiscal\n2022\n, we had purchases from our equity method investees of $\n30.1\nmillion. Total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal\n2022\nwere $\n79.0\nmillion.\nIn fiscal\n2021\n, we had purchases from our equity method investees of $\n28.7\nmillion. Total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal\n2021\nwere $\n56.5\nmillion.\nSummarized combined financial information for our equity method investments on a\n100%\nbasis is as follows:\n52\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n7.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe change in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal\n2023\nand\n2022\nwas as follows:\nOther identifiable intangible assets were as follows:\nDuring the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nmanagement reorganized its reporting structure for certain brands within\ntwo\nreporting units in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. The change in management reporting required us to reassign assets and liabilities, including goodwill, between the reporting units, complete a goodwill impairment test both prior to and subsequent to the change, and evaluate other assets in the reporting units for impairment, including indefinite-lived intangibles (brand names and trademarks). The fair value of our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis and the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles are determined using the \"relief from royalty\" methodology.\nBoth the \"relief from royalty\" methodology used to value our indefinite-lived intangible assets and the discounted cash flow analysis require us to estimate the future cash flows as well as to select a risk-adjusted discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. We estimate cash flows for a reporting unit over a discrete period (typically\nfive\nyears) and a terminal period (considering expected long-term growth rates and trends). Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates in areas such as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows, discount rates, or terminal growth rates could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value.\nWe used a discount rate of\n7.75\n% and a terminal growth rate that approximated\n1\n% in estimating the fair value of our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit during our impairment testing in the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023.\nAs a result of our impairment tests, we recognized goodwill impairment charges within SG&A expenses of $\n141.7\nmillion within our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit.  In addition, we recognized an impairment charge within SG&A expenses of $\n244.0\nmillion related to our\nBirds Eye\n® brand name in the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023.\nThe impairments were largely due to the\n125\nbasis point increase in the discount rate as a result of current economic conditions, including a significant increase in interest rates since our last quantitative impairment tests, as well as a downward revision to our sales forecasts.\nIn the\nfourth\nquarter of fiscal\n2023\n, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment on all of our reporting units and found\nno\nindicators of impairment. We completed a qualitative assessment on all of our reporting units with the exception of our Foodservice and Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting units. Our qualitative assessment considered, among other things, an increase in our market capitalization from our previous testing date, continued sales growth, and improvement in our operating margins which all had a positive impact on our financial results. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any significant changes in consumer purchasing behaviors, government restrictions, input cost inflation, or other macroeconomic conditions that could change certain assumptions and result in future impairments. We completed a quantitative impairment test for our Foodservice and Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting units. We used a discount rate of\n7.75\n% and a terminal growth rate that approximated\n1\n% in estimating the fair value of both of these reporting units. Based upon our quantitative impairment tests, the excess fair value over the carrying value for our Foodservice reporting unit was greater than\n30%.\nThe excess fair value over the carrying value for our Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit was less than\n10%,\nand fair value remained relatively consistent to our quantitative impairment test performed in the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023.\n53\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nAmortizing intangible assets, carrying a remaining weighted-average life of approximately\n18\nyears, are principally composed of customer relationships and acquired intellectual property. For fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, we recognized amortization expense of $\n56.8\nmillion, $\n59.3\nmillion, and $\n59.7\nmillion, respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nMay 28, 2023\n, amortization expense for the next\nfive\nyears is estimated to be as follows:\nFor our non-amortizing intangible assets, which are comprised of brands and trademarks, we use a \"relief from royalty\" methodology in estimating fair value. In the\nfourth\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\nas a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $\n345.2\nmillion, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments. The most notable brands with impairments included\nGardein\n®,\nBirds Eye®, Hungry Man®, Vlasic®, Van De Kamps®, Earth Balance®, and Comstock®.\nThese brands were negatively impacted by an increase in our discount rate in response to the current economic environment (including an increase in interest rates) since our last annual impairment test. Our\ntwo\nlargest impairments were related to\nGardein\n® and\nBirds Eye\n®\nin the amount of $\n91.5\nmillion and $\n78.3\nmillion, respectively. Both of these brands were negatively impacted by lower than expected profit margins which resulted in a reduction to our assumed royalty rates in addition to revised sales growth expectations to be consistent with recent industry trends. Including the\nBirds Eye\n® brand impairment recognized in the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\ndiscussed above, our total brand impairment charges recognized in fiscal\n2023\nwere $\n589.2\nmillion.\nDuring fiscal\n2022,\nas a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $\n209.0\nmillion, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments.\nDuncan Hines\n®\nand\nGardein\n®\nwere the most notable brands with impairments largely due to lower than expected profit margins which resulted in a reduction to our assumed royalty rates along with increases in our discount rate.\nDuring fiscal\n2021\n, as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles, we recognized impairment charges in SG&A expenses of $\n90.9\nmillion, primarily within our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments.\nUdi\n’\ns\n® was the most notable brand with impairment in fiscal\n2021\nlargely due to lower than expected sales and profit margins which resulted in a reduction to our assumed royalty rate.\n8.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted average outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding shares of common stock adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock unit awards, and other dilutive securities.\nThe following table reconciles the income and average share amounts used to compute both basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, there were\n0.5\nmillion\n,\n0.8\nmillion, and\n0.4\nmillion stock options outstanding, respectively, that were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average shares because the effect was antidilutive.\n54\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n9.\nINVENTORIES\nThe major classes of inventories were as follows:\n10.\nOTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES\nOther noncurrent liabilities consisted of:\n11.\nCAPITAL STOCK\nThe total number of shares we are authorized to issue is\n1,218,050,000\nshares, which shares\nmay\nbe issued as follows:\n1,200,000,000\nshares of common stock, par value $\n5.00\nper share;\n150,000\nshares of Class B Preferred Stock, par value $\n50.00\nper share;\n250,000\nshares of Class C Preferred Stock, par value $\n100.00\nper share;\n1,100,000\nshares of Class D Preferred Stock,\nno\npar value per share; and\n16,550,000\nshares of Class E Preferred Stock,\nno\npar value per share. There were\nno\npreferred shares issued or outstanding as of\nMay 28, 2023\n.\nWe have repurchased our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board. We repurchased\n4.2\nmillion shares of our common stock for approximately $\n150.0\nmillion in fiscal\n2023,\n1.5\nmillion shares of our common stock for approximately $\n50.0\nmillion in fiscal\n2022,\nand\n8.8\nmillion shares of our common stock for approximately $\n298.1\nmillion in fiscal\n2021.\n12.\nSHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\nIn accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant stock-based compensation awards, including restricted stock units, performance shares, performance-based restricted stock units, and stock options. The shares delivered upon vesting or lapse of restriction under any such arrangement\nmay\nconsist, in whole or part, of treasury stock or authorized but unissued stock,\nnot\nreserved for any other purpose.\nOn\nSeptember 19, 2014,\nour stockholders approved the Conagra Brands, Inc.\n2014\nStock Plan (as amended effective\nDecember 11, 2017,\nthe \"Plan\"). The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to\n40.3\nmillion shares of Conagra Brands common stock. In addition to the shares under the\n2014\nStock Plan, certain shares of Conagra Brands common stock subject to outstanding awards under predecessor stock plans that expire, lapse, are cancelled, terminated, forfeited, otherwise become unexercisable, or are settled for cash are available for issuance. At\nMay 28, 2023\n, approximately\n37.4\nmillion shares were reserved for granting new share-based awards.\n55\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nShare Unit Awards\nIn accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we grant awards of restricted stock units (\"share units\") to employees and directors. These awards generally have requisite service periods of\nthree\nyears. Under each such award, stock is issued without direct cost to the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do\nnot\nprovide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period (the \"vesting period\"). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments.\nWe recognize compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they occur. The compensation expense for our stock-settled share unit awards totaled $\n34.2\nmillion, $\n25.8\nmillion, and $\n28.1\nmillion for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. The tax benefit related to the stock-settled share unit award compensation expense for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\nwas\n$\n6.2\nmillion\n,\n$\n5.3\nmillion, and $\n6.1\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of\nMay 28, 2023\nand changes during the fiscal year then ended:\nDuring fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, we granted\n1.6\nmillion\n,\n1.1\nmillion, and\n0.9\nmillion stock-settled share units, respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value of\n$\n33.28\n, $\n34.26\n, and $\n36.72\nper share unit, respectively.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock-settled share units vested was\n$\n34.7\nmillion\n, $\n26.9\nmillion, and $\n24.6\nmillion during fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. The total intrinsic value of cash-settled share units vested was $\n4.3\nmillion during fiscal\n2021\n.\nAt\nMay 28, 2023\n, we had\n$\n32.0\nmillion\nof total unrecognized compensation expense that will be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.7\nyears\nrelated to stock-settled share unit awards.\nPerformance Share Awards\nPerformance shares are granted to selected executives and other key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various Company-wide performance goals. The performance goal for\none\n-\nthird\nof the target number of performance shares for the\nthree\n-year performance period ended in fiscal\n2023\n(the\n\"2023\nperformance period\") was based on our fiscal\n2021\ndiluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\"), subject to certain adjustments. The performance goal for the final\ntwo\n-thirds of the target number of performance shares granted for the\n2023\nperformance period was based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the\ntwo\n-year period ended in fiscal\n2023.\nThe performance goal for the\nthree\n-year performance period ending in fiscal\n2024\n(the\n\"2024\nperformance period\") is based on our diluted EPS CAGR, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period. The performance goals for the\nthree\n-year performance period ending in fiscal\n2025\n(the\n\"2025\nperformance period\") are based on our net sales and diluted EPS growth, subject to certain adjustments, measured over the defined performance period, with each year of the performance period weighted\none\n-third. For each of the\n2023\nperformance period,\n2024\nperformance period, and\n2025\nperformance period, the awards actually earned will range from\nzero\nto\ntwo hundred\npercent of the targeted number of performance shares for such performance period. Dividend equivalents are paid on the portion of performance shares actually earned at our regular dividend rate in additional shares of common stock.\nAwards, if earned, will be paid in shares of our common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in our performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed after the end of the performance period, and generally only if the participant continues to be employed with the Company through the date of distribution. For awards where performance against the performance target has\nnot\nbeen certified, the value of the performance shares is adjusted based upon the market price of our common stock and current forecasted performance against the performance targets at the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\n56\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nA summary of the activity for performance share awards as of\nMay 28, 2023\nand changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\nWe recognized expense of $\n45.0\nmillion, a benefit of $\n1.4\nmillion, and expense of $\n34.9\nmillion for our performance share awards in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. The tax expense related to the compensation benefit for fiscal\n2022\nwas $\n0.7\nmillion. The tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal\n2023\nand\n2021\nwas\n$\n1.7\nmillion\nand $\n3.6\nmillion, respectively.\nThe total intrinsic value of performance shares vested (including shares paid in lieu of dividends) during fiscal\n2022\nand\n2021\nwas $\n27.0\nmillion and $\n33.9\nmillion, respectively. Performance targets for the\nthree\n-year performance period ending in fiscal\n2022\nwere\nnot\nmet, resulting in\nno\nvesting during fiscal\n2023.\nBased on estimates at\nMay 28, 2023\n, we had\n$\n17.0\nmillion\nof total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance shares that will be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.7\nyears\n.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards\nOn\nApril\n15,\n2019\n(the \"grant date\"), we made grants of performance-based restricted stock unit (\"PBRSU\") awards to the Company's named executive officers and a limited group of other senior officers of the Company. The compensation expense for our PBRSU awards totaled $\n1.7\nmillion and $\n2.4\nmillion for fiscal\n2022\nand\n2021,\nrespectively. The tax expense (benefit) related to our PBRSU awards for fiscal\n2022\nand\n2021was\n$\n0.4\nmillion and $(\n0.2\n) million, respectively. As of\nMay 27, 2022,\nthe end of the PBRSU performance period, the awards did\nnot\nachieve the absolute TSR goals and resulted in a\n0\n% payout.\n57\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nStock Option Awards\nIn accordance with stockholder-approved equity incentive plans, we granted stock options to employees and directors for the purchase of common stock at prices equal to its fair value at the date of grant. Stock options become exercisable under various vesting schedules (typically\nthree\nyears) and generally expire\nseven\nto\nten\nyears after the date of grant.\nNo\nstock options were granted in fiscal\n2023\n,\n2022\n, or\n2021\n.\nA summary of the option activity as of\nMay 28, 2023\nand changes during the fiscal year then ended is presented below:\nWe recognized compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they occurred. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was\n$\n2.9\nmillion\n, $\n2.0\nmillion, and $\n7.0\nmillion for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. The closing market price of our common stock on the last trading day of fiscal\n2023\nwas\n$\n34.84\nper share.\nAt\nMay 28, 2023\n, we had\nno\nunrecognized compensation expense related to stock options.\nCash received from stock option exercises for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\nwas\n$\n10.7\nmillion\n, $\n7.8\nmillion, and $\n20.5\nmillion, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled\n$\n0.7\nmillion,\n$\n0.5\nmillion, and $\n1.7\nmillion for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\n13.\nPRE-TAX INCOME AND INCOME TAXES\nPre-tax income (including equity method investment earnings) consisted of the following:\n58\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe provision for income taxes included the following:\nIncome taxes computed by applying the U.S. Federal statutory rates to income before income taxes are reconciled to the provision for income taxes set forth in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows:\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds, were $\n407.1\nmillion, $\n299.1\nmillion, and $\n286.3\nmillion in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nThe tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:\n59\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at\nMay 28, 2023\nwas $\n23.7\nmillion, excluding a related liability of $\n5.6\nmillion for gross interest and penalties. As of\nMay 29, 2022\n, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $\n62.9\nmillion, excluding a related liability of $\n6.7\nmillion for gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was a benefit of $\n1.2\nmillion and $\n2.1\nmillion in fiscal\n2023\nand\n2022\n, respectively, and an expense of $\n1.4\nmillion in fiscal\n2021.\nThe net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nthat, if recognized, would favorably impact our effective tax rate was $\n21.3\nmillion and $\n58.0\nmillion, respectively.\nWe accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense.\nWe conduct business and file tax returns in numerous countries, states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") has completed its audit of the Company for tax years through fiscal\n2020.\nAll resulting significant items for fiscal\n2020\nand prior years have been settled with the IRS. Tax elections made in conjunction with filing our fiscal\n2021\nfederal tax return are still under review with the IRS. Statutes of limitation for pre-acquisition tax years of Pinnacle generally remain open for calendar year\n2003\nand subsequent years principally related to net operating losses. Other major jurisdictions where we conduct business generally have statutes of limitations ranging from\nthree\nto\nfive\nyears.\nWe estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $\n4.0\nmillion over the next\ntwelve\nmonths due to various federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations.\nThe change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nwas as follows:\nWe have approximately $\n11.8\nmillion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards ($\n11.5\nmillion will expire between fiscal\n2028\nand\n2043\nand $\n0.3\nmillion have\nno\nexpiration dates) and $\n69.2\nmillion of federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire between fiscal\n2024\nand\n2027.\nIncluded in net deferred tax liabilities are $\n18.3\nmillion of tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in various years ranging from fiscal\n2024\nto\n2043\nand $\n2.1\nmillion of tax effected state capital loss balances that expire in fiscal year\n2027\nthrough\n2037.\nForeign tax credits of $\n9.1\nmillion will expire between fiscal\n2025\nand\n2033.\nState tax credits of approximately $\n4.0\nmillion will expire in various years ranging from fiscal\n2024\nto\n2030.\nIn fiscal\n2022,\nwe reflected additional tax expense of $\n25.0\nmillion related to tax elections made in conjunction with filing our fiscal\n2021\nfederal tax return.  These elections are still under review with the IRS. These elections\nmay\nresult in increases to the tax basis in those assets and if successful would result in tax benefits being realized in future periods.\nWe have recognized a valuation allowance for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets we believe are\nnot\nmore likely than\nnot\nto be realized. The net change in the valuation allowance for fiscal\n2023\nwas an increase of $\n2.1\nmillion. During fiscal\n2023,\nwe concluded that certain tax elections made by a subsidiary had a confidence level of more-likely-than-\nnot\nwhich allowed us to release a valuation allowance of $\n28.1\nmillion. Additionally, a valuation allowance increased by $\n30.1\nmillion for an item that was previously reserved as an uncertain tax position. For fiscal\n2022\n, the change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $\n388.0\nmillion, which principally relates to valuation allowances on increases in tax basis from tax elections made on our fiscal\n2021\nfederal tax return that are still under review with the IRS.\n60\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nIn the prior year, we made the assessment that the current earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries were\nnot\nindefinitely reinvested or that we could\nnot\nremit to the U.S. parent in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $\n6.2\nmillion on approximately $\n123.4\nmillion of earnings at\nMay 28, 2023.\nThe deferred tax liability relates to local withholding taxes that will be owed when this cash is distributed. The undistributed historic earnings in our foreign subsidiaries through\nMay 30, 2021\nare considered to be indefinitely reinvested or can be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. Accordingly, we have\nnot\nrecorded a deferred tax liability related to these undistributed historic earnings.\nOn\nAugust 16, 2022,\nthe Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022\nwas signed into law. We continue to evaluate the impact of the recently enacted law, including whether we are subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. However, we do\nnot\nexpect the impact to be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n14.\nLEASES\nWe have operating and finance leases of certain warehouses, plants, land, office space, production and distribution equipment, automobiles, and office equipment. We determine whether an agreement is or contains a lease at lease inception. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nAs most of our leases do\nnot\nprovide an implicit interest rate, we calculate the lease liability at lease commencement as the present value of unpaid lease payments using our estimated incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term and is determined using a portfolio approach based on information available at the commencement date of the lease.\nWe have elected\nnot\nto separate lease and non-lease components of an agreement for all underlying asset classes prospectively from the ASU\n2016\n-\n02,\nLeases, Topic\n842\nadoption date.\nAny lease arrangements with an initial term of\ntwelve\nmonths or less are\nnot\nrecorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognize lease cost for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOur lease terms\nmay\ninclude options to extend or terminate the lease. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our ROU asset and lease liabilities. A limited number of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Our lease agreements do\nnot\ncontain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nLeases reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\n61\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe components of total lease cost were as follows:\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rate for our leases as of\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nwere as follows:\nCash flows arising from lease transactions were as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities by fiscal year as of\nMay 28, 2023\nwere as follows:\nWe have entered into contracts that are or contain a lease that have\nnot\nyet commenced with aggregate payments totaling $\n268.5\nmillion as of\nMay 28, 2023\n. This amount primarily relates to a warehouse facility with a future minimum lease commitment of $\n254.3\nmillion over a term of\n20\nyears. We expect to take control of this leased asset in fiscal\n2024.\n62\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n15.\nCONTINGENCIES\nLitigation Matters\nWe are a party to certain litigation matters relating to our acquisition of Beatrice Company (\"Beatrice\") in fiscal\n1991,\nincluding litigation proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition. These proceedings have included suits against a number of lead-based paint and pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products Company, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\"ConAgra Grocery Products\"), as alleged successor to W. P. Fuller & Co., a lead-based paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by a predecessor to Beatrice from\n1962\nuntil\n1967.\nThese lawsuits have generally sought damages for personal injury, property damage, economic loss, and governmental expenditures allegedly caused by the use of lead-based paint, and/or injunctive relief for inspection and abatement. When such lawsuits have been brought, ConAgra Grocery Products has denied liability, both on the merits of the claims and on the basis that we do\nnot\nbelieve it to be the successor to any liability attributable to W. P. Fuller & Co. In the\nfirst\nhalf of fiscal\n2023,\nwe obtained a final judgment in our favor in\none\nsuch lawsuit that had been brought in Illinois. Pursuant to the settlement of a consolidated lead-based paint and pigment related action in California in\n2019,\nConAgra Grocery Products is responsible for payments totaling $\n101.7\nmillion, payable in\nseven\nannual installments from fiscal\n2020\nthrough fiscal\n2026,\nof which $\n61.0\nmillion had been paid as of\nMay 28, 2023.\nAs part of the settlement, ConAgra Grocery Products has also provided a guarantee of up to $\n15.0\nmillion in the event co-defendant, NL Industries, Inc., defaults on its payment obligations. We had accrued $\n11.8\nmillion and $\n28.9\nmillion, within other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, for this matter as of\nMay 28, 2023.\nWe are party to a number of putative class action lawsuits challenging various product claims made in the Company's product labeling. In the\nfirst\nhalf of fiscal\n2023,\nwe settled\none\nsuch claim, a class action lawsuit captioned,\nBriseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et al\n, related to the labeling for\nWesson\n® oils as\n100%\nnatural, for $\n3.0\nmillion. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of the remaining claims or any other legal proceedings, we do\nnot\nexpect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.\nIn the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2023,\na consolidated shareholder derivative lawsuit against our executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in\n2018\ncaptioned\nKlein v. Arora, et al.\n, was dismissed and the lawsuit was terminated\n.\nWe are party to matters challenging the Company's wage and hour practices. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal proceedings, we do\nnot\nexpect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.\nWe are party to a number of matters asserting product liability claims against the Company related to certain Pam® and other cooking spray products. These lawsuits generally seek damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by defects in the design, manufacture, or safety warnings of the cooking spray products. We have put the Company's insurance carriers on notice. While we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal proceedings, the Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for the litigation related to the cooking spray products based on information available to us at the time of our evaluation.\nThe Company reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from the litigation related to the cooking spray products, including studying its claims experience and considering numerous variables that can affect its liability exposure from the litigation related to the cooking spray products on an overall or per lawsuit basis. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from the litigation related to the cooking spray products, the Company has updated its liability analysis for the litigation related to the cooking spray products through\nMay 28, 2023.\nAlthough it is reasonably possible that the amount of the loss ultimately incurred\nmay\nbe in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements, we do\nnot\nexpect these cooking spray product matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.\n63\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nEnvironmental Matters\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") regulations require us to disclose certain information about environmental proceedings if a governmental authority is a party to such proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that we reasonably believe will exceed a stated threshold. Pursuant to the SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of $\n1.0\nmillion for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required.\nIn\nOctober 2019,\nthe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (\"MPCA\") initiated an odor complaint investigation at our Waseca, Minnesota vegetable processing facility. As a result of the investigation, the MPCA required implementation of a continuous monitoring system running from\nMay 1\nto\nOctober 31\nin\n2020\nand\n2021\nand from\nApril 1\nto\nOctober 31\nin\n2022\nto monitor hydrogen sulfide emissions at the wastewater treatment facility. As a result of the monitoring data findings, the MPCA has alleged violations of Minnesota Ambient Air Quality Standards based on our hydrogen sulfide emissions during calendar years\n2020,\n2021,\nand\n2022.\nWhile a settlement agreement has\nnot\nbeen finalized, the parties have tentatively agreed upon a penalty amount of $\n1.25\nmillion for all of the alleged violations.\nWe are a party to certain environmental proceedings relating to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to our acquisition in fiscal\n1991,\nincluding litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's possible status as a potentially responsible party at approximately\n35\nSuperfund, proposed Superfund, or state-equivalent sites (the \"Beatrice sites\"). The Beatrice sites consist of locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides, fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes, and/or other contaminants. Reserves for these Beatrice environmental proceedings have been established based on our best estimate of the undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean-up, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its experience in remediating sites. The accrual for Beatrice-related environmental matters totaled $\n40.1\nmillion ($\n1.5\nmillion within other accrued liabilities and $\n38.6\nmillion within other noncurrent liabilities)\nas of\nMay 28, 2023\n, a majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent sites referenced above.\nGuarantees and Other Contingencies\nIn certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. As of\nMay 28, 2023,\nwe continued to guarantee an obligation of the Lamb Weston business pursuant to a guarantee arrangement that existed prior to the spinoff of the Lamb Weston business (the \"Spinoff\"), remained in place following completion of the Spinoff, and will remain in place until such guarantee obligation is substituted for guarantees issued by Lamb Weston. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, dated as of\nNovember 8, 2016 (\nthe \"Separation Agreement\"), between us and Lamb Weston, this guarantee arrangement is deemed a liability of Lamb Weston that was transferred to Lamb Weston as part of the Spinoff. Accordingly, under the Separation Agreement, in the event that we are required to make any payments as a result of this guarantee arrangement, Lamb Weston is obligated to indemnify us for any such liability, reduced by any insurance proceeds received by us. Lamb Weston is a party to an agricultural sublease agreement with a\nthird\nparty for certain farmland through\n2025\n(subject, at Lamb Weston's option, to extension for\none\nadditional\nfive\n-year period). Under the terms of the sublease agreement, Lamb Weston is required to make certain rental payments to the sublessor. We have guaranteed to the sublessor Lamb Weston's performance and the payment of all amounts (including indemnification obligations) owed by Lamb Weston under the sublease agreement, up to a maximum of $\n75.0\nmillion. We believe the farmland associated with this sublease agreement is readily marketable for lease to other area farming operators. As such, we believe that any financial exposure to the Company, in the event that we were required to perform under the guarantee, would be largely mitigated.\n64\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nWe also guarantee a lease resulting from an exited facility. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n, the remaining term of this arrangement did\nnot\nexceed\nfour\nyears and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $\n8.7\nmillion.\nGeneral\nAfter taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should\nnot\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity; however, it is reasonably possible that a change of the estimates of any of the foregoing matters\nmay\noccur in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nCosts of legal services associated with the foregoing matters are recognized within SG&A expenses as services are provided.\n16.\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nOur operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In the normal course of business, these risks are managed through a variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.\nCommodity futures and option contracts are used from time to time to economically hedge commodity input prices on items such as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, packaging materials, dairy, grains, diesel fuel and electricity. Generally, we economically hedge a portion of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to\n36\nmonths. We\nmay\nenter into longer-term economic hedges on particular commodities, if deemed appropriate. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n, we had economically hedged certain portions of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using derivative instruments with expiration dates through\nMay 2024.\nIn order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into forward exchange, option, or swap contracts from time to time for transactions denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. This includes, but is\nnot\nlimited to, hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n, we had economically hedged certain portions of our foreign currency risk in anticipated transactions using derivative instruments with expiration dates through\nFebruary 2024.\nFrom time to time, we\nmay\nuse derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, to reduce risk related to changes in interest rates. This includes, but is\nnot\nlimited to, hedging against increasing interest rates prior to the issuance of long-term debt and hedging the fair value of our senior long-term debt.\nDerivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges\nDuring the\nfirst\nquarter of fiscal\n2019,\nwe entered into deal-contingent forward starting interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to our issuance of long-term debt to help finance the acquisition of Pinnacle. We settled these contracts during the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2019\nand deferred a $\n47.5\nmillion gain in accumulated other comprehensive income that is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the lives of the related debt instruments. In the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2021,\n$\n0.5\nmillion was written off in connection with the early extinguishment of debt (see Note\n3\n). The unamortized amount at\nMay 28, 2023\nwas $\n31.5\nmillion.\n65\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nEconomic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows\nMany of our derivatives do\nnot\nqualify for, and we do\nnot\ncurrently designate certain commodity or foreign currency derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold). The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results immediately.\nEconomic Hedges of Fair Values\n—\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe\nmay\nuse options and cross currency swaps to economically hedge the fair value of certain monetary assets and liabilities (including intercompany balances) denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. These derivatives are marked-to-market with gains and losses immediately recognized in SG&A expenses. These substantially offset the foreign currency transaction gains or losses recognized as values of the monetary assets or liabilities being economically hedged change.\nAll derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value (refer to Note\n18\nfor additional information related to fair value measurements). The fair value of derivative assets is recognized within prepaid expenses and other current assets, while the fair value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other accrued liabilities. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we offset certain derivative asset and liability balances, as well as certain amounts representing rights to reclaim cash collateral and obligations to return cash collateral, where master netting agreements provide for legal right of setoff. At\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\n, amounts representing right to reclaim cash collateral and an obligation to return cash collateral of $\n21.3\nand $\n4.0\nmillion, respectively, were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative assets and liabilities and amounts representing a right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral were reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\nThe following table presents our derivative assets and liabilities at\nMay 28, 2023\n, on a gross basis, prior to the setoff of $\n8.3\nmillion to total derivative assets and $\n13.0\nmillion to total derivative liabilities where legal right of setoff existed:\n66\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents our derivative assets and liabilities, at\nMay 29, 2022\n, on a gross basis, prior to the setoff of $\n20.1\nmillion to total derivative assets and $\n16.1\nmillion to total derivative liabilities where legal right of setoff existed:\nThe location and amount of gains (losses) from derivatives\nnot\ndesignated as hedging instruments in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows:\n67\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nAs of\nMay 28, 2023\n, our open commodity contracts had a notional value (defined as notional quantity times market value per notional quantity unit) of $\n134.6\nmillion for purchase contracts. As of\nMay 29, 2022\n, our open commodity contracts had a notional value of $\n115.3\nmillion and $\n96.7\nmillion for purchase and sales contracts, respectively. The notional amount of our foreign currency forward and cross currency swap contracts as of\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nwas $\n87.3\nmillion and $\n106.6\nmillion, respectively.\nWe enter into certain commodity, interest rate, and foreign exchange derivatives with a diversified group of counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and limit the amount of credit exposure to any\none\nparty. These transactions\nmay\nexpose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties. We have\nnot\nincurred a material loss due to nonperformance in any period presented and do\nnot\nexpect to incur any such material loss. We also enter into futures and options transactions through various regulated exchanges.\nAt\nMay 28, 2023\n, the maximum amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, had the counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contracts, was $\n0.6\nmillion.\n17.\nPENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nWe have defined benefit retirement plans (\"pension plans\") for eligible salaried and hourly employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service. We also sponsor postretirement plans which provide certain medical and dental benefits to qualifying U.S. employees. Effective\nAugust 1, 2013,\nour defined benefit pension plan for eligible salaried employees was closed to new hire salaried employees. New hire salaried employees will generally be eligible to participate in our defined contribution plan.\nWe recognize the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For our pension plans, we also recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the net of tax results of the actuarial gains or losses within the corridor and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are\nnot\nrecognized in net periodic benefit cost. For our postretirement plans, we also recognize as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the net of tax results of the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are\nnot\nrecognized in net periodic benefit cost. These amounts will be adjusted out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as they are subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. For our pension plans, we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur, to the extent they exceed the corridor, eliminating amortization. Amounts are included in the components of pension and postretirement plan costs, below, as recognized net actuarial loss.\n68\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe changes in benefit obligations and plan assets at\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nare presented in the following table.\nThe $\n265.5\nmillion actuarial gain reducing our projected benefit obligation at the end of fiscal\n2023\nis principally related to the increase in the discount rate from\n4.48\n% to\n5.50\n%. The change in interest rates also impacted the fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities which contributed to the $\n158.1\nmillion reduction in plan assets in fiscal\n2023.\nThe funded status and amounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nwere as follows:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n2.80\nbillion and $\n3.13\nbillion at\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\n, respectively.\n69\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nwere as follows:\nComponents of pension and postretirement plan costs included:\nIn fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021,\nthe Company recorded charges of $\n0.1\nmillion, a gain of $\n2.9\nmillion, and charges of $\n0.8\nmillion, respectively, reflecting the year-end write-off of actuarial gains and losses in excess of\n10\n% of our pension liability.\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:\nWeighted-Average Actuarial Assumptions Used to Determine Net Expense\nThe Company uses a split discount rate (spot-rate approach) for the U.S. plans and certain foreign plans. The spot-rate approach applies separate discount rates for each projected benefit payment in the calculation of pension service and interest cost.\n70\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nWe amortize prior service cost for our pension and postretirement plans, as well as amortizable gains and losses for our postretirement plans, in equal annual amounts over the average expected future period of vested service. For plans with\nno\nactive participants, average life expectancy is used instead of average expected useful service.\nPlan Assets\nThe fair value of plan assets, summarized by level within the fair value hierarchy described in Note\n18,\nas of\nMay 28, 2023\n, was as follows:\nThe fair value of plan assets, summarized by level within the fair value hierarchy described in Note\n18,\nas of\nMay 29, 2022\n, was as follows:\nLevel\n1\nassets are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. The majority of the Level\n1\nassets listed above include the common stock of both U.S. and international companies, mutual funds, and master limited partnership units, all of which are actively traded and priced in the market.\nLevel\n2\nassets are valued based on other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities, yield curves, indices, etc. Level\n2\nassets consist primarily of individual fixed income securities where values are based on quoted prices of similar securities and observable market data.\nLevel\n3\nassets consist of investments where active market pricing is\nnot\nreadily available and, as such, fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs.\n71\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nCertain assets that are measured at fair value using the NAV (net asset value) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have\nnot\nbeen classified in the fair value hierarchy. Such investments are generally considered long-term in nature with varying redemption availability. For certain of these investments, with a fair value of approximately $\n26.2\nmillion as of\nMay 28, 2023\n, the asset managers have the ability to impose customary redemption gates which\nmay\nfurther restrict or limit the redemption of invested funds therein. As of\nMay 28, 2023\n,\nno\nsuch gates were imposed.\nAs of\nMay 28, 2023\n, we have unfunded commitments for additional investments of $\n35.2\nmillion in private equity funds and $\n10.1\nmillion in natural resources funds. We expect unfunded commitments to be funded from plan assets rather than the general assets of the Company.\nTo develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the pension plans, we consider the current asset allocation strategy, the historical investment performance, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.\nOur pension plan weighted-average asset allocations by asset category were as follows:\nDue to the salaried pension plan freeze that occurred in fiscal\n2018,\nthe Company's pension asset strategy is now designed to align our pension plan assets with our projected benefit obligation to reduce volatility by targeting an investment strategy of approximately\n90\n% in fixed-income securities and approximately\n10\n% in return seeking assets, primarily equity securities, real estate, and private assets.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the benefit obligation of the postretirement plans.\nWe currently anticipate making contributions of approximately $\n12.1\nmillion to our pension plans in fiscal\n2024.\nWe anticipate making contributions of $\n7.2\nmillion to our other postretirement plans in fiscal\n2024.\nThese estimates are based on ERISA guidelines, current tax laws, plan asset performance, and liability assumptions, which are subject to change.\nThe following table presents estimated future gross benefit payments for our plans:\n72\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nThe Company contributes to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under collective bargaining agreements that cover certain units of its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in such plans are different from the risks of single-employer plans, in the following respects:\nThe Company's participation in multiemployer plans for the fiscal year ended\nMay 28, 2023\nis outlined in the table below. For each plan that is individually significant to the Company the following information is provided:\nFor plans that are\nnot\nindividually significant to Conagra Brands the total amount of contributions is presented in the aggregate.\n73\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe Company was\nnot\nlisted in the Forms\n5500\nfiled by any of the other plans or for any of the other years as providing more than\n5\n% of the plan's total contributions. At the date our financial statements were issued, Forms\n5500\nwere\nnot\navailable for plan years ending in calendar year\n2022.\nCertain of our employees are covered under defined contribution plans. The expense related to these plans was $\n59.4\nmillion, $\n57.9\nmillion, and $\n47.6\nmillion in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\n18.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board guidance establishes a\nthree\n-level fair value hierarchy based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or liabilities. The\nthree\nlevels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel\n1\n— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,\nLevel\n2\n— Observable inputs other than those included in Level\n1,\nsuch as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and\nLevel\n3\n— Unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe fair values of our Level\n2\nderivative instruments were determined using valuation models that use market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level\n2\nprimarily represent commodity and foreign currency option and forward contracts.\n74\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of\nMay 28, 2023\n:\nThe following table presents our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, based upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall, as of\nMay 29, 2022\n:\nCertain assets and liabilities, including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and equity investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level\n3\ninputs.\nDuring fiscal\n2023,\nwe recognized a credit loss of $\n3.9\nmillion within SG&A expenses related to our convertible note receivable.  The loss was measured using the best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected.\nWe recognized charges for the impairment of certain indefinite-lived brands. The fair values of these brands were estimated using the \"relief from royalty\" method (see Note\n7\n). Impairments in our Grocery & Snacks segment totaled $\n78.9\nmillion, $\n90.7\nmillion, and $\n13.0\nmillion for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. Impairments in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment totaled $\n496.6\nmillion, $\n103.9\nmillion, and $\n76.9\nmillion for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. Impairments in our International segment totaled $\n13.7\nmillion, $\n14.4\nmillion, and $\n1.0\nmillion for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively.\nDuring fiscal\n2023,\ngoodwill impairment charges totaling $\n141.7\nmillion were recognized within our Refrigerated & Frozen segment.  The impairments were measured using a discounted cash flow valuation model specific to the Sides, Components and Enhancers reporting unit (see Note\n7\n).\nDuring fiscal\n2023,\nwe recognized impairment charges totaling $\n0.5\nmillion in our Grocery & Snacks segment, $\n5.7\nmillion in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and $\n20.5\nmillion in our Foodservice segment. During fiscal\n2022,\nwe recognized impairment charges totaling $\n26.3\nmillion in our Grocery & Snacks segment, $\n28.9\nmillion in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, and $\n14.9\nmillion in our Foodservice segment. The impairments were measured based upon the estimated sales price of a disposal group that\nno\nlonger met the held for sale criteria as of the\nsecond\nquarter of fiscal\n2023\n(see Note\n5\n).\n75\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nWe recognized charges for the impairment of certain long-lived assets measured based upon the estimated sales price of the assets. Impairments totaled $\n3.0\nmillion in our Grocery & Snacks segment in fiscal\n2021.\nThe carrying amount of long-term debt (including current installments) was $\n8.60\nbillion as of\nMay 28, 2023\nand $\n8.80\nbillion as of\nMay 29, 2022\n. Based on current market rates, the fair value of this debt (level\n2\nliabilities) at\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\nwas estimated at $\n8.31\nbillion and $\n8.85\nbillion, respectively.\n19.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION\nWe reflect our results of operations in\nfour\nreporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, and Foodservice.\nThe Grocery & Snacks reporting segment principally includes branded, shelf-stable food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\nThe Refrigerated & Frozen reporting segment includes branded, temperature-controlled food products sold in various retail channels in the United States.\nThe International reporting segment principally includes branded food products, in various temperature states, sold in various retail and foodservice channels outside of the United States.\nThe Foodservice reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, sauces, and a variety of custom-manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments primarily in the United States.\nWe do\nnot\naggregate operating segments when determining our reporting segments.\nOperating profit for each of the segments is based on net sales less all identifiable operating expenses. General corporate expense, pension and postretirement non-service income, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings have been excluded from segment operations.\n76\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents further disaggregation of our net sales:\nTo be consistent with how we present certain disaggregated net sales information to investors, we have categorized certain net sales of our segments as \"Staples\", which includes all of our U.S. domestic retail refrigerated products and other shelf-stable grocery products. Management continues to regularly review financial results and make decisions about allocating resources based upon the\nfour\nreporting segments outlined above.\nPresentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) from Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results\nDerivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are\nnot\ndesignated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. In the event that management determines a particular derivative entered into as an economic hedge of a forecasted commodity purchase has ceased to function as an economic hedge, we cease recognizing further gains and losses on such derivatives in corporate expense and begin recognizing such gains and losses within segment operating results, immediately.\n77\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology:\nAs of\nMay 28, 2023\n, the cumulative amount of net derivative losses from economic hedges that had been recognized in general corporate expenses and\nnot\nyet allocated to reporting segments was $\n21.2\nmillion. This amount reflected net losses of $\n21.4\nmillion incurred during the fiscal year ended\nMay 28, 2023\n, as well as net gains of $\n0.2\nmillion incurred prior to fiscal\n2023\n. Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify to segment operating results net losses of $\n20.1\nmillion in fiscal\n2024\nand $\n1.1\nmillion in fiscal\n2025\nand thereafter.\nAssets by Segment\nThe majority of our manufacturing assets are shared across multiple reporting segments. Output from these facilities used by each reporting segment can change over time. Also, working capital balances are\nnot\ntracked by reporting segment. Therefore, it is impracticable to allocate those assets to the reporting segments, as well as disclose total assets by segment. Total depreciation expense for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\nwas $\n313.1\nmillion, $\n316.1\nmillion, and $\n328.0\nmillion, respectively.\nOther Information\nOur operations are principally in the United States. With respect to operations outside of the United States,\nno\nsingle foreign country or geographic region was significant with respect to consolidated operations for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n. Foreign net sales, including sales by domestic segments to customers located outside of the United States, were approximately $\n1.04\nbillion, $\n1.00\nbillion, and $\n960.5\nmillion in fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively. Our long-lived assets located outside of the United States are\nnot\nsignificant.\nOur largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately\n28\n%,\n27\n%, and\n26\n% of consolidated net sales for fiscal\n2023,\n2022,\nand\n2021\n, respectively, significantly impacting the Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments.\nWalmart, Inc. and its affiliates accounted for approximately\n29\n% and\n30\n% of consolidated net receivables as of\nMay 28, 2023\nand\nMay 29, 2022\n, respectively.\n78\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFiscal Years Ended\nMay 28, 2023,\nMay 29, 2022,\nand\nMay 30, 2021\n(columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts)\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nConagra Brands, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Conagra Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 28, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n–\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 28, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n–\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n79\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill\nAs described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, indefinite-lived intangible assets (consisting primarily of brand names and trademarks) and goodwill as of May 28, 2023 were $2.47 billion and $11.18 billion, respectively. For the fiscal year ended May 28, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $589.2 million and $141.7 million on indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively. In assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment, the Company performs either a qualitative or quantitative assessment at least annually or whenever circumstances indicate a potential impairment exists. When a quantitative assessment is performed for indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company estimates the fair value of the intangibles by utilizing a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate that would be charged to a third party for the use of the brand. When a quantitative assessment is performed for goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing a discounted cash flow model. Impairment charges are recorded for any intangible assets or goodwill with carrying values in excess of their respective estimated fair values.\nWe identified the evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets and the goodwill assigned to the Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit as a critical audit matter. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of certain identified-lived intangible assets and the goodwill assigned to the Sides, Components, Enhancers reporting unit the Company performed quantitative impairment tests. Subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions used in determining the fair value of these assets. These assumptions included the forecasted revenue growth rates including the terminal growth rates and forecasted margins, royalty rates, and discount rates.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the quantitative impairment assessments, including controls over the development of the assumptions described above. To assess the Company’s ability to forecast, we compared historical forecasts to actual results. We evaluated the forecasted revenue growth rates including the terminal growth rates and forecasted margins, which were also used to support the royalty rates used in the indefinite-lived asset impairment testing, by considering current and past performance, as well as external market and industry outlook data. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n/s/\nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nOmaha, Nebraska\nJuly 13, 2023\n80"

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report and determined that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nConagra Brands' management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of Conagra Brands (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

Conagra Brands' internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Conagra Brands; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Conagra Brands are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of Conagra Brands; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Conagra Brands' assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nWith the participation of Conagra Brands' Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the effectiveness of Conagra Brands' internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023. In making this assessment, management used criteria established in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\"). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of May 28, 2023, its internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of Conagra Brands' internal control over financial reporting as of May 28, 2023 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this annual report on Form 10-K."
