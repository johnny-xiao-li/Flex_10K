As of January 1, 2023, we employed approximately 6,300 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 40 countries and marketing products and services in more than 190 countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.\nRaw Materials, Key Components and Supplies\nEach of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.\nIn some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.\nCompetition\nDue to the range and diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. Our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods\n14\nand services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.\nWe compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market positions. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.\nRegulatory Affairs\nOur operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar foreign agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of our product activities, and if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products.\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products and services to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, as well as other penalties.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. In addition, changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include the handling, transportation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.\nWe may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.\nWe are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $12.2 million and $11.9 million as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As\n15\nassessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.\nWe may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of January 1, 2023, we employed approximately 16,700 employees on a worldwide basis. Roughly 80% of our workforce is based outside of the United States. Several of our subsidiaries outside the United States have employment contracts with our employees where the terms and conditions are influenced by labor unions and workers’ councils’ agreements that involve approximately 5,000 of our employees. During fiscal year 2022, our voluntary turnover rate was 14%. We believe that management of our human capital resources is vital to the continued growth and success of our company, and we endeavor to create an environment that encourages productivity, rewards performance and values diversity. There are several ways in which we attempt to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees, as set forth below.\nOur human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, developing, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees. We strive to meet this objective by offering competitive compensation and benefits, in a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. We hold our employees to high performance standards and our compensation plans are designed to deliver competitive base pay and attractive incentive opportunities. Our benefits programs are specifically tailored to the various countries in which we operate and maintain a significant workforce. We benchmark for market practices and adjust our compensation and benefits programs to ensure they remain both equitable and competitive.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. We have employees in roughly 40 countries around the world. As of the date of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, women comprised roughly 34% of our leadership positions on a global basis, which we define as director level and above. We have provided further information regarding our diversity demographics in our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Report and elsewhere on our website at esg.perkinelmer.com, including summarized data from our EEO-1 form.\nesg.perkinelmer.com is a home for information related to ESG policies and initiatives at PerkinElmer. The site provides information for our employees, customers and investors on our environmental and social metrics and policies, our global efforts to preserve our environment and our global efforts to promote social equality. It helps our employees and stakeholders know and understand of our commitment to make positive impacts on our employees, customers, local communities and the environment, while engaging others in our efforts.\nOur EEO-1 form is a report filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission describing the racial, ethnic and gender composition of our U.S.-based workforce. Information on our website, including the ESG Report, shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report.\nWe understand that our ability to operate in a multicultural world is critical to our long-term value creation. By maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion, we believe that we can innovate more effectively. To that end, we seek to promote diverse perspectives throughout our organization and are an equal opportunity employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race, religion, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or other characteristics protected by law.\nOur commitment to diversity is evidenced by the establishment of our internal Inclusion and Diversity Committee, formed in fiscal year 2020, which is comprised of a wide cross-section of leaders across all regions and backgrounds. The committee focuses on driving increased diversity within our workforce, as well as creating a safe and engaging platform for dialogue on these issues for all of our employees. Our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment is further validated by our employees, as reflected in the results of our 2021 PerkinElmer People Experience Engagement Survey, where we received high scores in the areas of Diversity & Inclusion, Inclusiveness, and Non-Discrimination. Among other comments, employees shared that they are proud of the emphasis we place on diversity and inclusion, and on making our company a place\n16\nwhere everyone is valued and respected. We furthered our journey to maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace in 2022 through the launch of three additional employee resource groups offering our Hispanic and Veteran communities enhanced opportunities and visibility as well our Able group highlighting the power of individuals with disabilities. Focusing also on engagement and belonging, we launched four new Employees Networking Groups during fiscal year 2022 to allow our employees to regroup and connect over their passions or common areas of interest.\nTraining and Development\nWe are committed to the continued development and training of our employees and we seek to provide them with meaningful learning opportunities to help grow their capabilities and careers. We provide such opportunities across all levels of our organization, covering a variety of professional, technical and leadership topics. We do so through a variety of channels and formats, including formal (classroom-based, blended learning solutions, digital learning) and informal, on-the-job learning.\nA pivotal component of our annual performance review and goal-setting process focuses on providing employees with constructive and actionable feedback, as well as management engagement in the creation and completion of development goals. In addition, employees have access to confidential, anonymous feedback through a process that is used as a development tool to help raise awareness on how they are perceived. Lastly, we recognize that professional development requires support of the whole person, and we therefore offer virtual coaching to help eligible employees meet their unique development goals, whether such goals are leadership or well-being focused.\nWith regards to career growth, we regularly fill open vacancies with internal candidates. Our internal mobility program empowers employees to explore many different career options available to them.\nLastly, management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development.\nHealth and Safety\nOur success depends on the well-being of our employees, and one of our top priorities is to protect the health and safety of our employees. We maintain a culture focused on safety and strive to identify, eliminate and control risk in the workplace to prevent injury and illness. Our employees have access to a global safety management system and are encouraged to report incidents, near misses, or other observations in the system. The system has been widely adopted in our manufacturing locations across the globe, and management uses the information generated by it to set safety-related policies and to establish goals for future performance. Further, we provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance and other resources that support their physical and mental well-being. In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to take actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. In particular, during fiscal year 2022, we have followed rigorous safety measures in China, during the country’s various lockdowns and subsequent re-openings, and provided well-being support activities for our employees and their families.\nCommunity\nAt PerkinElmer, we have long held the view that responsible global citizenship along with good governance principles and ethical business practices are essential tenets for sustainability and success. We encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and where we operate, and to assist in that effort, we fund a long-term charitable matching program for our employees. In addition, we have established a group comprised of management and subject matter experts at our company to focus on developing and delivering on measurable advancements in the areas of reducing waste, reducing carbon emissions and improving employee engagement and diversity."

    "text": "The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:\nRisks Related to our Business Operations and Industry\nIf the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.\nOur customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly revenue and results\n17\nof operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.\nThe pandemic caused by COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on the demand for certain of our products and our global operations including our manufacturing capabilities, logistics and supply chain that may materially and adversely impact our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks related to public health crises and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The global impact of COVID-19 resulted in an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, due to significant global mitigation measures, including government-directed quarantines, social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, and travel restrictions and/or bans. Continued uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the volatility of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extended global economic disruption, and a global recession is possible.\nWe have experienced significant reductions in demand for certain of our products due to the COVID-19 pandemic and although the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, additional impacts that we may experience include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in our stock price due to market volatility; further decreases in demand for certain of our products; reduced profitability; large-scale supply chain disruptions impeding our ability to ship and/or receive product; potential interruptions of, or limitations on manufacturing operations imposed by local, state or federal governments; shortages of key raw materials or components; workforce absenteeism and distraction; labor shortages including those resulting from unwillingness to comply with vaccination or other requirements; customer credit concerns; cybersecurity risks and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements; reduced sources of liquidity; increased borrowing costs; fluctuations in foreign currency markets; potential impairment in the carrying value of goodwill; other asset impairment charges; increased obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans; and deferred tax valuation allowances.\nSubstantial uncertainty remains regarding the further development of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we currently anticipate that business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on the growth rate of certain of our businesses, and may also have a material adverse impact on our overall financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Diagnostics segment experienced an increase in revenue resulting from increased demand for our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics COVID-19 product offerings during fiscal years 2020 and 2021, as well as from the COVID-19 testing laboratory facilities we developed to service the State of California and the United Kingdom. The laboratory in the United Kingdom closed earlier in 2022 and the laboratory in the State of California closed in the second quarter of 2022. As a result of these closures, and the general reduction in COVID-19 testing spending by our customers, the demand for these products and services declined in fiscal year 2022 and we expect it will continue to decline in fiscal year 2023, with revenue largely contingent upon consumer demand for COVID-19 testing as well as our ability to develop, produce and market COVID-19 products.\nOur growth and profitability is subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities.\nOur business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets, particularly as the United States and other countries balance concerns around debt, inflation, growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the United States and internationally. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, including war or other conflicts, such as the current conflict in Ukraine, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.\n18\nWhile we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities, a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties, cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nCertain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments, or other measures, and some of these risks are insurable, but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful. Our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments.\nIf we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.\nWe sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:\n•\naccurately anticipate customer needs,\n•\ninnovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications,\n•\nreceive regulatory approvals in a timely manner,\n•\nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,\n•\nprice our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and\n•\ndifferentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.\nMany of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.\nIn addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures, such as the divestiture of the Analytical, Food and Enterprise Services businesses, license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable.\nWe have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, such as:\n•\ncompetition among buyers and licensees,\n•\nthe high valuations of businesses and technologies,\n•\nthe need for regulatory and other approval, and\n•\nour inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.\nSome of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition. If, for example, we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant in-process research and development that we have capitalized, we may have to impair the value of such assets. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences, loss of key personnel, unforeseen\n19\nregulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which may adversely impact our profitability.\nAdditionally, if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest, such as our recent agreement to divest our Analytical, Food and Enterprise Service businesses to New Mountain Capital L.L.C., the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. The transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals as well as establishing operational segregations, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in or liability with respect to the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Our ability to provide transition services and support to assist the buyer in the transition to certain functions, including, but not limited to, information technology, accounting and human resources, for a certain period of time may cause us to incur unanticipated costs and liabilities and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\nWe encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.\nOur quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.\nGiven the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed in the short term, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. As a result, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:\n•\ndemand for and market acceptance of our products,\n•\ncompetitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,\n•\nchanges in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises or pandemics,\n•\nchanges in general economic conditions or government funding,\n•\nsettlements of income tax audits,\n•\nexpenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations,\n•\ncontract termination and litigation costs,\n•\ndiffering tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation,\n•\nchanges in our effective tax rate,\n•\nchanges in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,\n•\nchanges in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers,\n•\nour ability to introduce new products,\n•\nour competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,\n•\ncosts of raw materials, labor, energy, supplies, transportation or other indirect costs,\n20\n•\nchanges in healthcare or other reimbursement rates paid by government agencies and other third parties for certain of our products and services,\n•\nour ability to realize the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives,\n•\nchanges in the volume or timing of product orders,\n•\nfluctuation in the expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans,\n•\nchanges in our assumptions underlying future funding of pension obligations,\n•\nchanges in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions, and\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates.\nA significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.\nWe ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States; TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe; and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including commercial airlines, freight carriers, national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers.\nDisruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.\nThe production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. In addition, a global health crisis or pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic, wars, conflicts, or other changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, could have a significant adverse effect on our supply chain.\nWe are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and their derivatives) that may be contained in our products are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. As a result of these rules, we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflict-free, and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs.\nIf we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers and scientists, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or those of our customers, suppliers or other third parties, or cybercrime, resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of\n21\ninformation or assets, or if we fail to implement new systems, software and technologies successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop, manufacture and provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our and our third-party service providers' information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers, suppliers or other third parties, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems or cybercrime, resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets, could result in losses or misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\nOur results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nAs of January 1, 2023, our total assets included $9.9 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, customer relationships, core technology and technology licenses and in-process research and development, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “indefinite-lived”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets.\nAdverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.\nPatent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. The expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.\nThird parties have in the past and may in the future also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications, or claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries.\nIf we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.\nWe may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.\nOur licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market, or incur losses for failing to comply with our contractual obligations. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights\n22\ngranted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.\nRisks Related to Legal, Government and Regulatory Matters\nThe manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products, services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies in the United States and abroad, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil, criminal or monetary penalties.\nOur operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances, the collection, storage, transfer, use, disclosure, retention and other processing of personal data, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards. A failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil, criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations.\nChanges in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.\nWe compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, data privacy and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.\nThe healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Foreign Operations\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability.\n23\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2022. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n•\nchanges in actual, or from projected, foreign currency exchange rates,\n•\na global health crisis of unknown duration, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\n•\nwars, conflicts, or other changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,\n•\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,\n•\ntrade protection measures including embargoes, sanctions and tariffs, such as the sanctions and other restrictions implemented by the United States and other governments on the Russian Federation and related parties in connection with the conflict in Ukraine,\n•\nimport or export licensing requirements and the associated potential for delays or restrictions in the shipment of our products or the receipt of products from our suppliers,\n•\npolicies in foreign countries benefiting domestic manufacturers or other policies detrimental to companies headquartered in the United States,\n•\ndiffering tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,\n•\nadverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives,\n•\ndiffering business practices associated with foreign operations,\n•\ndifficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States,\n•\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,\n•\ndiffering labor laws and changes in those laws,\n•\ndiffering protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection,\n•\nexpanded enforcement of laws related to data protection and personal privacy,\n•\nincreasing global enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and\n•\ndiffering regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.\nRisks Related to our Debt\nWe have a substantial amount of outstanding debt, which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and stock repurchases;\n•\nreducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions;\n•\nexposing us to interest rate risk as a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates;\n•\nincreasing our foreign currency risk as a portion of our debt obligations are in denominations other than the U.S. dollar; and\n•\nincreasing the chances of a downgrade of our debt ratings due to the amount or intended purpose of our debt obligations.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. In addition, the market for both public and private debt offerings could experience liquidity concerns and increased volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could ultimately increase our borrowing costs and limit our ability to obtain future financing.\n24\nRestrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities.\nOur senior unsecured revolving credit facility, senior unsecured notes due in 2023 (“2023 Notes”), senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (“2024 Notes”), senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (“2026 Notes”), senior unsecured notes due in 2028 (“2028 Notes”), senior unsecured notes due in 2029 (“2029 Notes”), senior unsecured notes due in 2031 (“March 2031 Notes”),  senior unsecured notes due in 2031 (“September 2031 Notes”) and senior unsecured notes due in 2051 (“2051 Notes”) include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n•\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,\n•\nsell assets,\n•\nincur obligations that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to make dividend or other payments to us,\n•\nguarantee or secure indebtedness,\n•\nenter into transactions with affiliates, and\n•\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nWe are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating, our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments.\nAny future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the 2023 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2028 Notes, the 2029 Notes, the March 2031 Notes, the September 2031 Notes, the 2051 Notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances.\nDiscontinuation or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our variable rate debt.\nOur indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits of U.S. dollars. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month) was subsequently extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the United States has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. No later than June 30, 2023, our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility will be indexed to a replacement benchmark based on SOFR in accordance with the terms of that facility. This change could cause the effective interest rate under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall interest expense to increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur share price will fluctuate.\nOver the last several years, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n•\noperating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors,\n•\nthe financial performance of the major end markets that we target,\n•\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us,\n25\n•\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors,\n•\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, inflation, freight costs, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets, and\n•\nchanges to economic conditions arising from global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic or from wars or conflicts.\nDividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.\nOn October 26, 2022, we announced that our\nBoard of Directors (our “Board”) had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2022\nthat was paid in February 2023\n. On January 26, 2023, we\nannounced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of\nfiscal year 2023\nthat will be payable in May 2023. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources."

We are not obligated to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAccounting Period\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. Each of the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 (“fiscal year 2022”) and January 2, 2022 (“fiscal year 2021”) included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 (“fiscal year 2020”) included 53 weeks. The fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) will include 52 weeks.\nOverview of Fiscal Year 2022\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we continued to see strong returns from our acquisitions as well as our organic investments across technology, marketing and people. Our overall revenue in fiscal year 2022 decreased by $516.0 million, or 13%, as compared to fiscal year 2021, reflecting a decrease of $913.0 million, or 31%, in our Diagnostics segment revenue, partially offset by an increase of $395.2 million, or 44%, in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue.\nRevenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $366.9 million to our overall revenue during fiscal year 2022.\nThe decrease in our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by decreased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings, partially offset by an increase in our core product offerings resulting in a decrease of $689.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue and a decrease of $225.8 million in our applied genomics revenue.\nRevenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $58.1 million to our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2022\n. The increase in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2022 was driven by an increase of $395.2 million in our life sciences market revenue. Revenu\ne from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $308.7 million to the increase in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2022.\nIn our Diagnostics segment, we experienced a global decline in demand for our COVID-19 product offerings due to the cancellation of our service contracts for the State of California and the United Kingdom, and lower COVID-19 testing volumes compared to\nfiscal year 2021. We saw strong growth in our core immunodiagnostics business in the Americas and Europe, partially offset by the impact of extensive\nshutdowns in China. In our reproductive health business, an expanded range of product offerings and increased geographic reach more than offset the impact of declining birthrates.\nIn our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment, the increase in our life sciences market revenue was the result of an increase in revenue in our pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets across all regions. Instruments, reagents and software experienced strong growth and we saw a positive impact from pricing actions we took in early 2022.\nOur consolidated gross margins decreased 350 basis points in fiscal year 2022, as compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to increased amortization of acquired intangible assets and lower revenue from our COVID-19 product offerings, partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix and service productivity. Our consolidated operating margin decreased 1,045 basis points in fiscal year 2022, as compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to lower revenue from our COVID-19 product offerings, increased costs related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, and investments in new product development and growth initiatives. During fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions and inflation did not materially impact our results of operations as compared to fiscal year 2021 as the effects of our initiatives to reduce transportation costs more than offset the impact of inflation on our raw materials purchases. During fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions and inflation increased our cost of goods sold by less than\n$10.0 million\nas compared to fiscal year 2021.\nOverall, we believe that our strategic priorities and recent portfolio transformations, coupled with our expanded range of product offerings, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued revenue growth, strong margins and cash flows, and long-term earnings per share growth.\n31\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021\nRevenue\nRevenue for fiscal year 2022 was $3.3 billion, as compared to $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $0.5 billion, or 13%, w\nhich includes an approximate\n4%\ndecrease in revenue attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an approximate\n9% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions\n.\nRevenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed\n$366.9 million to\nour overall revenue during fiscal year 2022.\nThe\nanalysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and acquisitions and divestitures. The decrease in total revenue reflects a decrease in our Diagnostics segment revenue of $913.0 million, or 31%, due to decreased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings, partially offset by an increase in our core product offerings resulting in a decrease of $689.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue and a decrease of $225.8 million in our applied genomics revenue. Our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue increased by $395.2 million, or 44%, due to increase in revenue in our life sciences market, particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.8 million and $2.6 million of revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $1.3 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of approximately $71.8 million, or 5%. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue increased to 40% in fiscal year 2022 from 36% in fiscal year 2021, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of approximately 350 basis points to 60% in fiscal year 2022 from 64% in fiscal year 2021. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $141.6 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $100.7 million for fiscal year 2021. Amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $88.5 million for fiscal year 2022. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $45.3 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $35.2 million for fiscal year 2021. Other purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $6.2 million for fiscal year 2022, of which $5.6 million was acquisition-related stock compensation and $0.6 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipme\nnt. The overall decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix, pricing actions and service productivity.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2022 were $1,025.5 million, as compared to $975.2 million for fiscal year 2021, an increase of approximately $50.3 million, or 5%. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 31% in fiscal year 2022 from 25% in fiscal year 2021. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $229.1 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $155.9 million for fiscal year 2021. Amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $135.3 million for fiscal year 2022. Acquisition and divestiture-related expenses added an incremental expense of $28.9 million for fiscal year 2022, of which $15.6 million was acquisition-related stock compensation, as compared to acquisition and divestiture-related expenses increasing expenses by $59.7 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $3.9 million was acquisition-related stock compensation. Purchase accounting adjustments decreased expenses by $1.2 million for fiscal year 2022, resulting from a $1.4 million change in contingent consideration, partially offset by $0.2 million in increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment, as compared to purchase accounting adjustments increasing expenses by $2.9 million for fiscal year 2021, which was attributable to change in contingent consideration. Asset impairment costs added an incremental expense of $3.9 million for fiscal year 2021. Legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements, net of reversals, decreased expenses by $0.6 million for fiscal year 2022. In addition to the above items, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to investments in people, digital capabilities, innovation, and recent acquisitions.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2022 were $221.6 million, as compared to $200.3 million for fiscal year 2021, an increase of $21.3 million, or 11%. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses increased to 7% in fiscal year 2022 from 5% in fiscal year 2021. Stock compensation related to our acquisitions added an incremental expense of $5.4 million in fiscal year 2022, as compared to $1.4 million for fiscal year 2021. Purchase accounting adjustments for depreciation on property, plant and equipment added an incremental expense of $0.2 million in fiscal year 2022, as compared to $0.1 million for fiscal year 2021.\nExcluding the factors above, the net\nincrease in research and development\n32\nexpenses\nwas due to timing of investments in new non-COVID-19 product development, partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 related research and development expenses.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consisted of the following for the fiscal years ended:\nThe increase of $36.0 million in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was largely due to a change in fair value of financial securities of $15.8 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to $(11.0) million in fiscal year 2021, an increase of $1.8 million in interest expense and $4.5 million in other expense, net in fiscal year 2022 and a lower net pension credit of $33.2 million in fiscal year 2022 as compared to $37.4 million in fiscal year 2021. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rates on continuing operations were 21.3% and 26.1% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under statutory tax rates. A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal\nstatutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nThe variation in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 is primarily affected by the accrual of $20.5 million related to a change in tax status of a certain foreign subsidiary. During fiscal year 2021, we also recognized $37.1 million in U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. taxes related to foreign earnings that we no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. During fiscal year 2022, we adjusted these estimates and recognized a net benefit of $4.9 million relative to our position to permanently reinvest those foreign earnings. We also recognized $1.1 million of benefit in fiscal year 2022 derived from the tax holiday in Singapore. We recognized $18.2 million in fiscal year 2021 of benefits derived from tax holidays in China and Singapore. The effect of these benefits, derived from tax holidays, on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2022 was $0.01 and $0.01, respectively, and for fiscal year 2021 was $0.16 and $0.16, respectively. The tax holiday in China is renewed every three years. We expect to renew the tax holiday for one of our subsidiaries in China that is set to expire in fiscal year 2023.\n33\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was $3.8 billion, as compared to $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 44%, w\nhich includes an approximate 11% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions,\nand a 1% increase in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe\nanalysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and acquisitions and divestitures. The total increase in revenue reflects an increase in our Diagnostics segment revenue of $865.0 million, or 42%, due to increased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings resulting in an increase of $748.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue.\nOur Diagnostics segment revenue also\nincrease\nd during\nfiscal year 2021\ndue to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of\n$58.0 million\nin our reproductive health revenue and an increase of\n$59.0 million\nin our applied genomics revenue.\nOur Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue increased by\n$301.1 million\n, or 50%, due to an increase in\nrevenue in our life sciences market, particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.\nAs a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $2.6 million and $1.1 million of revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $1.4 billion, as compared to $933.1 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of approximately $460.8 million, or 49%.

Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $100.7 million for fiscal year 2021,  as compared to $51.4 million for fiscal year 2020. Amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $34.0 million for fiscal year 2021. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $35.2 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $1.8 million for fiscal year 2020. Other purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2021, of which $1.6 million was acquisition-related stock compensation and $0.2 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment. Asset impairment was $7.9 million for fiscal year 2020. The overall decrease in gross margin\nwas partially offset by a favorable shift in product mix and service productivity.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $975.2 million, as compared to $716.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of approximately $258.7 million, or 36%.

Purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $2.8 million was change in contingent consideration and $0.1 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment, as compared to purchase accounting adjustments increasing expenses by $3.5 million for fiscal year 2020, which was attributable to change in contingent consideration. Asset impairment costs added an incremental expense of $3.9 million for fiscal year 2021. Legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements were $5.9 million for fiscal year 2020. Costs for significant environmental matters were $5.2 million for fiscal year 2020. In addition to the above items, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to investments in people, digital capabilities and innovation, and recent acquisitions amplified by pandemic-related cost controls and disruptions in the prior year.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $200.3 million, as compared to $146.4 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $53.9 million, or 36.8%. Research and development expenses from our 2021 acquisitions were $24.0 million.

The increase of $52.4 million in interest expense in fiscal year 2021 was the result of $23.4 million of costs of bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedges that were recognized in fiscal year 2021 and interest expense from new debt in fiscal year 2021. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rates on continuing operations were 26.1% and 21.2% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Segment operating margin increased 750 basis points in fiscal year 2022, as compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to pricing actions, product mix and higher sales volume.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was $897.7 million, as compared to $596.6 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $301.1 million, or 50%, which includes an approximate 33% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and a 1% increase in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The increase in revenue in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment was a result of an\nincrease in revenue in our life sciences market, particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets.\nSegment operating income for fiscal year 2021 was $281.6 million, as compared to $129.2 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $152.4 million, or 118%. Segment operating margin increased 970 basis points in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by investments in new product development and growth initiatives.\n36\nDiagnostics\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021\nRevenue for fiscal year 2022 was $2,019.7 million, as compared to $2,932.7 million for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $913.0 million, or 31%, which includes an appro\nximate\n2%\nincrease in revenue attributable to acquisitions\nand a 4% decrease in revenue attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contribute\nd $58.1 million to our Dia\ngnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2022.\nThe\ndecrease\nin our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by decreased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings, partially offset by an increase in our core product offerings resulting in a\ndecrease of $689.0 million\nin our immunodiagnostics revenue, a\ndecrease of $225.8 million\nin our applied genomics revenue, and an\nincrease of $1.7 million\nin our reproductive health revenue.\nSegment operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2022 was $782.0 million, as compared to $1,432.8 million for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $650.8 million, or 45%. Segment operating margin decreased 1,020 basis points in fiscal year 2022, as compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to lower sales volume and product mix, partially offset by cost controls.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was\n$2,932.7 million\n, as compared to $2,067.7 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $865.0 million, or 42%, which includes an approximate\n5%\nincrease in revenue attributable to acquisitions\nand a\n2% increase in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The increase in our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings resulting in an\nincrease of $748.0 million\nin our immunodiagnostics revenue. Our Diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of\n$58.0 million\nin our reproductive health revenue and an increase of\n$59.0 million\nin our applied genomics revenue.\nSegment operating income for fiscal year 2021 was $1,432.8 million, as compared to $1,010.4 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $422.4 million, or 42%. Segment operating margin was flat in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable product mix, offset by increased investments in new product development and growth initiatives.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn August 2022, we entered into a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Polaris Purchaser, L.P. (the “Purchaser”), a Delaware limited partnership owned by funds managed by affiliates of New Mountain Capital L.L.C. (the “Sponsor”), under which we agreed to sell to the Purchaser certain assets and the equity interests of certain entities constituting our Analytical, Food and Enterprise Services businesses (the “Business”) (as further defined in the Purchase Agreement), for cash consideration of up to approximately $2.45 billion and the Purchaser’s assumption of certain liabilities relating to the Business (collectively, the “Transaction”). Approximately $2.30 billion of the purchase price will be payable at closing, subject to certain customary adjustments, which includes $75.0 million in deferred payments tied to the transfer of the PerkinElmer brand and related trademarks to the Purchaser (which may be completed within 24 months following the date of the closing at our election). The Purchase Agreement also provides for potential post-closing payments totaling up to $150.0 million, which are contingent on the exit valuation the Sponsor and its affiliated funds receive on a sale or other capital events related to the Business. The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nThe Business had been recorded in the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment. The sale of the Business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements. Accordingly, we have classified the assets and liabilities related to the Business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets and its results of operations are classified as income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. Financial information in this report relating to the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this discontinued operation.\nThe summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations, were as follows:\n37\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we recognized $69.4 million of divestiture-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations, as compared to $7.5 million during fiscal year 2021, an increase of $61.9 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by decreased amortization expense and acquisition-related costs. During fiscal year 2022, we recognized $8.2 million of amortization expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations, as compared to $19.3 million during fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $11.1 million, as we suspended the amortization of the intangible assets related to the Business during fiscal year 2022 when it was reclassified into discontinued operations. During fiscal year 2022, we recognized $6.4 million of incentive award associated with one of the Company’s acquisitions in discontinued operations, as compared to $14.3 million during fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $7.8 million.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, divestiture-related costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in discontinued operations increased by $7.5 million as compared to fiscal year 2020. In addition, payroll and employee benefits and acquisition-related costs pertaining to an incentive award associated with one of the Company’s acquisitions increased by $20.4 million and $9.6 million, respectively, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are cash flows from our operations, borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured credit facility and access to the debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. The proposed sale of the Business classified as discontinued operations is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, which we expect will generate approximately $2.2 billion of proceeds to us. We expect to use these proceeds for funding upcoming debt maturities, opportunistic share repurchases and continued strategic and value-creating acquisitions.\nWe and our subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness.\nPrincipal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:\n•\nchanges in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and\n•\nchanges in our working capital requirements.\nPrincipal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:\n•\nfinancial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,\n•\nincreases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,\n•\na ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,\n38\n•\nincreases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,\n•\na decrease in the market price for our common stock, and\n•\nvolatility in the public debt and equity markets.\nCash Flows\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021\nOperating Activities.\nNet cash provided by continuing operations was $672.5 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $1,330.2 million for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $657.7 million. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2022 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $512.7 million, adjustments for non-cash charges aggregating to $422.8 million, including depreciation and amortization of $427.0 million, and a net cash decrease in working capital of $263.0 million. During fiscal year 2022, we contributed $6.6 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States.\nInvesting Activities.\nNet cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations was $116.9 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $4,089.8 million for fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $3,972.9 million. For fiscal year 2022, we used $7.5 million of net cash for acquisitions, as compared to $3,982.2 million used in fiscal year 2021. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 were $85.6 million, primarily for manufacturing equipment and other capital equipment purchases, as compared to $86.0 million for fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2022, we purchased investments amounting to $47.2 million as compared to $23.1 million in fiscal year 2021. These items were partially offset by $14.5 million in proceeds from disposition of businesses and assets in fiscal year 2022, as compared to $1.5 million in fiscal year 2021.\nIn addition, proceeds from notes receivable were $8.9 million\nin fiscal year 2022\n.\nProceeds from surrender of life insurance policies were $0.1 million in fiscal year 2021.\nFinancing Activities.\nNet cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations was $661.8 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to net cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations of $2,941.7 million for fiscal year 2021, an increase of $3,603.5 million in net cash used in financing activities. The cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was primarily a result of payments of borrowings, repurchases of our common stock, payments of dividends and settlement of cash flow hedges.\nDuring\nfiscal year 2022, we made net payments on our borrowings of\n$559.2 million, as\ncompared to net proceeds from borrowin\ngs of $3,043.0 million duri\nng fiscal year 2021. The changes reflect financing transactions in fiscal year 2021 to finance acquisitions and to refinance borrowings as compared to paying down debt in fiscal year 2022, which we expect to continue throughout fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased shares of our common stock for a total cost of $80.6 million, as compared to $73.1 million in fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2022, we paid $35.3 million in dividends as compared to $32.4 million for fiscal year 2021. We paid $0.8 million in settlement of hedges during fiscal year 2022 as compared to $4.5 million for fiscal year 2021. In addition, we paid $14.3 million for settlement of a swap and $2.2 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration in fiscal year 2021. The cash used in financing activities during fiscal year 2022 was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of $14.1 million during fiscal year 2022, as compared to $25.1 million for fiscal year 2021.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nOperating Activities.\nNet cash provided by continuing operations was $1,330.2 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $704.7 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $625.5 million. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $889.4 million, adjustments for non-cash charges aggregating to $307.8 million, including depreciation and amortization of $311.4 million, and a net cash increase in working capital of $133.0 million. During fiscal year 2021, $1.7 million of contingent consideration payments were included in operating activities. During fiscal year 2021, we contributed $6.9 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States and\n$20.0 million\nto our defined benefit pension plan in the United States.\nInvesting Activities.\nNet cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations was $4,089.8 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $490.6 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $3,599.2 million. For fiscal year 2021, we used $3,982.2 million of net cash for acquisitions, as compared to $411.5 million used in fiscal year 2020. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 were $86.0 million, primarily for manufacturing equipment and other capital equipment purchases, as compared to $63.6 million for fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we purchased investments amounting to $23.1 million as compared to $20.1 million in fiscal year 2020. These items were partially offset by $1.5 million in proceeds from disposition of businesses and assets in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $4.3 million in fiscal year 2020, and by proceeds from surrender of life insurance policies of $0.1 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $0.3 million in fiscal year 2020.\n39\nFinancing Activities.\nNet cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations was $2,941.7 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations of $202.9 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $3,144.5 million in net cash provided by financing activities. The cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was primarily a result of net proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans. During fiscal year 2021\n, we had net proceeds from borrowings of\n$3,043.0 million, as\ncompared to net payments on borrowings\nof $187.5 million duri\nng\nfiscal year 2020\n. The changes reflect financing transactions in fiscal year 2021 to finance acquisitions and to refinance borrowings as compared to paying down debt in fiscal year 2020.\nProceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans were $25.1 million during fiscal year 2021, as compared to $37.7 million for fiscal year 2020. The cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was partially offset by repurchases of our common stock, payments of dividends, settlement of swaps, settlement of cash flow hedges and payments for acquisition-related contingent consideration. During fiscal year 2021, we repurchased shares of common stock for a total cost of $73.1 million, as compared to $6.9 million in fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $32.4 million in dividends as compared to $31.2 million for fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $14.3 million for settlement of a swap. We paid $4.5 million in settlement of hedges during fiscal year 2021 as compared to $4.6 million for fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $2.2 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration as compared to $10.4 million in fiscal year 2020.\nBorrowing Arrangements\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we repaid the full $500.0 million principal amount of the term loan facility. Since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we have repurchased $32.9 million and $78.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our 0.550% senior unsecured notes due in September 2023 (the\n“2023 Notes”\n) and 0.850% senior unsecured notes due in September 2024 (the\n“2024 Notes”\n), respectively, in open market transactions.\nWe expect to complete the repayment of the\n$467.1 million in\noutstanding 2023 Notes in fiscal year 2023.\nWe expect to continue repurchasing outstanding 2024 Notes from time to time, subject to market conditions.\nSee Note 13,\nDebt,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nDividends\nOur Board of Directors (our “Board”) declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. At January 1, 2023, we had accrued $8.8 million for a dividend declared in October 2022 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that was paid in February 2023. On January 26, 2023, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 that will be payable in May 2023. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2022, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.\nOther Potential Liquidity Considerations\nAt January 1, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $454.4 million, of which $385.4 million was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we had $1.5 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We had no other liquid investments at January 1, 2023.\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We use our non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the United States including foreign operations,\ncapital investments, acquisitions and repayment of debt. In addition, we transfer cash to the United States using nontaxable returns of capital, distributions of previously taxed income, as well as dividends, where the related income tax cost is managed efficiently. We have accrued tax expense on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the\n“\nTax Act\n”\n) and where the foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested. In accordance with the Tax Act, we are making scheduled annual cash payments on our accrued transition tax.\nAs of January 1, 2023, we evaluated our undistributed foreign earnings and identified approximately $879.0 million in earnings that we do not consider to be permanently reinvested. We have recorded a provision of approximately $15.8 million for taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated. We began repatriating foreign earnings to the United States in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and expect to continue the repatriation in fiscal year 2023. There are no other undistributed\n40\nforeign earnings and outside basis differences for which we have not provided for any taxes as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested, and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability that would be incurred.\nOn July 31, 2020, our Board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $250.0 million under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On July 22, 2022, the Repurchase Program was terminated by our Board and the Board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $300.0 million under a new stock repurchase program (the\n“\nNew Repurchase Program\n”\n). No shares remain available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program due to its termination. The New Repurchase Pro\ngram will expire on July 22, 2024 unless terminated earlier by our Board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2022\n, we repurchased 240,000 shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of $43.4 million.\nDuring fiscal year 2022\n, we\nrepurchased 138,025 shares of common stock under the New Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of\n$19.1 million\n. As of January 1, 2023,\n$280.9 million\nremained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the New Repurchase Program.\nIn addition, our Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans. During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 115,247 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $18.1 million. During fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 71,248 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $10.5 million.\nThe repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the New Repurchase Program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nAs of January 1, 2023, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $106.2 million. As of January 1, 2023, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $46.6 million, of which $3.6 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $43.0 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods is 5.9 years from January 1, 2023, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at January 1, 2023 was 4.9 years.\nDistressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.\nOur pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. With respect to plans outside of the United States, we expect to contribute $6.8 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2023, we contributed $10.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States for the plan year 2022. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we contributed $6.6 million, $6.9 million and $7.5 million in the aggregate, respectively, to pension plans outside of the United States. During fiscal year 2021, we contributed $20.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States.\nWe could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. We expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.\nWe are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations, and are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in our opinion, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at January 1, 2023 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. See “Business—Environmental Matters\n”\nabove and\nNote 16,\nContingencies,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these matters and proceedings.\n41\nEffects of Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1,\nNature of Operations and Accounting Policies,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements. We did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the fiscal year 2022. We do not believe that any recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounting for business combinations, long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles and employee compensation and benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness combinations.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities as\nsumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. For intangible assets, we normally utilize the\n“\nincome method\n”\nwhich incorporates the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset, adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Depending on the asset valued, the key assumptions included one or more of the following: (1) future revenue growth rates, (2) future gross margin, (3) future selling, general and administrative expenses, (4) royalty rates, (5) customer attrition rates, and (6) discount rates. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of\nfinite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.\nValue of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.\nWe carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimates of fair values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings.\nFor goodwill, the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. We perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. We completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of January 3, 2022, and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment. At January 3, 2022, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20.0% for each reporting unit. The range of the long-term terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 2.0% to 5.0% for the fiscal year 2022 impairment analysis. The range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 7.0% to 11.5%. Keeping all other variables\n42\nconstant, a 10.0% change in any one of these input assumptions for the vari\nous reporting units would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill.\nIn connection with the fiscal year 2023 impairment test performed as of January 2, 2023, the Tulip and EUROIMMUN reporting units, which had goodwill balances of $74.4 million and $572.0 million, respectively, at January 1, 2023, had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 20%. These reporting units are at increased risk of an impairment charge given the higher discount rates, competition and, to some extent, the recent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increased impairment risk associated with these reporting units, we do not believe there will be a significant change in the key estimates or assumptions driving the fair value of these reporting units that would lead to a material impairment charge.\nWe consistently emplo\ny the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. Cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years. The income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. The long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our long-term terminal growth rates. We corroborate the income approach with a market approach. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.\nEmployee compensation and benefits.\nWe sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.\nWe recognized gains of $28.3 million and $30.9 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which include the gains from the immediate recognition of the actuarial gains and losses for the benefit plans, which were recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The loss or income related to the immediate recognition of the actuarial gains and losses on benefit plans were pre-tax gains of $28.9 million and $24.7 million fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect an expense of approximately $13.3 million in fiscal year 2023 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding any actuarial gains and losses. It is difficult to reliably calculate and predict the amount of any actuarial gains and losses in fiscal year 2023 as these gains and losses are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. To the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, actuarial losses will impact our operating results. Conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, actuarial gains will favorably impact our operating results. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year. We use discount rates for each individual plan based upon the expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period.\nIf any of our assumptions were to change as of January 1, 2023, our pension plan expenses would also change as follows:\n43"

    "text": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, derivatives, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 1, 2023.\nWe use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nPrincipal hedged currencies include the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee, Singapore Dollar and Swedish Krona. We held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling $476.9 million at January 1, 2023, $371.9 million at January 2, 2022, and $808.0 million at January 3, 2021, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally 30 days or less during each of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nIn addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance our acquisitions and stock repurchase program, we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. We record these hedges at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements, included combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $360.2 million as of January 2, 2022. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material.\nDuring fiscal year 2018, we designated a portion of the 2026 Notes to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 Notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of January 1, 2023, the total notional amount of the 2026 Notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €497.2 million. The unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses recorded in AOCI related to the net investment hedge were $(34.5) million, $33.2 million and $49.6 million during the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe do not expect any material net pre-tax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into interest and other expense, net within the next twelve months.\nSee Note 19,\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.\n44\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.\nForeign Exchange Risk.\nThe potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately 55% of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the United States, resulting in natural hedges.\nAlthough we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted.\nForeign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk Disclosure\n. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of January 1, 2023, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $3.1 million. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2022, the Value-At-Risk ranged between $1.3 million and $3.1 million, with an average of approximately $2.1 million.\nInterest Rate Risk.\nAs of January 1, 2023\n, we had no outstandi\nng borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates; all of our other debt bear interest at fixed rates. Our cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $454.4 million at January 1, 2023. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures. However, no such instruments are outstanding at January 1, 2023.\nInterest Rate Risk—Sensitivity\n. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:\n(i) Changes in interest rates can cause our interest expense and cash flows to fluctuate to the extent we have borrowing outstanding on our revolving credit facility.\n(ii) Changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate.\nWe believe that we do not have any material exposure of interest rate risk.\n45"

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\n46\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of PerkinElmer, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nDiscontinued Operations - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nIn August 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain assets and the equity interests of certain entities constituting the Analytical, Food and Enterprise Services businesses (the “Business”). At that time, management determined that the proposed sale met the criteria for the Business to be classified as held-for-sale and the results of operations and cashflows of the Business was presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification 205-20,\nDiscontinued Operations\n(“ASC 205-20”).\nThe net assets of the Business were $\n1.42\nbillion and $\n1.40\nbillion as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nGiven the level of operational and financial integration between the Business and the continuing operations of the Company, auditing the segregation of assets and liabilities of the Business and the identification of the results of operation and cashflows of the Business required both extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the identification and measurement of the net assets of the Business and the related results of operations and cashflows presented as discontinued operations included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the identification of the net assets, results of operations and cash flows included in the Company’s discontinued operations presentation.\n•\nWe obtained and read the purchase and sale agreement for the proposed sale and compared the terms of that agreement to the identification of the assets and liabilities included in the disposal group.\n•\nWe assessed the Company’s identification of assets and liabilities and the related operations and cash flows of the Business by testing the completeness and accuracy of the Company’s accounting data and schedules that segregate the Business from the continuing operations of the Company.\n•\nWe assessed the presentation and disclosures related to the discontinued operations to ensure proper application of ASC 205-20.\n/s /\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMarch 1, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n47\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n48\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n49\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n50\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n51\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the Fiscal Years Ende\nd\n52\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n53\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1:\nNature of Operations and Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations:\nPerkinElmer, Inc. is a leading provider of products, services and solutions to the diagnostics and life sciences and applied markets. The Company has two operating segments: Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics. The Company’s Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment focuses on service and innovating for customers spanning the life sciences and applied markets. The Company’s Diagnostics segment is targeted towards meeting the needs of clinically-oriented customers, especially within the growing areas of reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and applied genomics.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In August 2022, the Company announced the proposed sale of certain assets and the equity interests of certain entities constituting the Company’s Analytical, Food and Enterprise Services businesses (the “Business”). The 2021 and 2020 consolidated financial statements presented herein have been retrospectively adjusted to present the Business as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. Each of the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 (“fiscal year 2022”) and January 2, 2022 (“fiscal year 2021”) included\n52\nweeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 (“fiscal year 2020”) included 53 weeks.\nThe fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) will include\n52\nweeks.\nAccounting Policies and Estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the promised products or services when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of those products or services to customers.\nTaxes that are collected by the Company from a customer and assessed by a governmental authority, that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, are excluded from revenue.\nThe Company reports shipping and handling revenue in revenue, to the extent it is billed to customers, and the associated costs in cost of product revenue.\nInventories\n:  Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely than not.\nThe Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. These reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense.\n54\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nThe Company depreciates property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over its estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings-\n10\nto\n40\nyears; leasehold improvements - estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter; and machinery and equipment-\n3\nto\n8\nyears. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a\n3\n-year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits:\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. The Company immediately recognizes actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to the Company's fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless the Company is required to perform an interim remeasurement. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis. The Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies:\nFor foreign operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as translation gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions considered permanent in nature, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses arising from transactions and translation of period-end balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in other expense, net\n.\nBusiness Combinations:\nBusiness combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nThe Company’s intangible assets consist of (i) goodwill, which is not being amortized; (ii) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of a trade name that is not subject to amortization; and (iii) amortizing intangibles, which consist of patents, trade names and trademarks, licenses, customer relationships and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nThe process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. This annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of the amortizing intangible asset\n.\nAmortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their respective fair values.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense based on estimated grant date fair value, generally using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is recognized as expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period. The determination of fair value and the timing of expense using option pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company estimates the expected term assumption based on historical\n55\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nexperience. In determining the Company’s expected stock price volatility assumption, the Company reviews both the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s common stock.\nMarketable Securities and Investments:\nInvestments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in AOCI until realized. Investments in equity securities are recorded at their fair values with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings. Investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost minus impairment, if any.\nWhen an observable price change in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer has occurred, the Company elects to carry those equity investments at fair value as of the date that the observable transaction occurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nThe Company considers all highly liquid, unrestricted instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nThe Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.\nResearch and Development:\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. In-process research and development (“IPRD”) costs acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the product is ready for sale or expensed if abandoned.\nRestructuring and Other Costs:\nGenerally, costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred. Prior to recording restructuring charges for employee separation agreements, the Company notifies all employees of termination. Costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period.\nComprehensive Income:\nComprehensive income is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging:\nDerivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.\nFor a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms of the contract to the underlying transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive income, unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements. Settled cash flow hedges related to forecasted transactions that remain probable are recorded as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and are subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis. The Company also has entered into other foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into interest and other expense, net on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company also uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, as well as the offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold.\nLeases:\nOperating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. When the Company’s lease did not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental\n56\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nborrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company used the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as cars, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nThe Company has made an accounting policy election not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases for facilities and equipment. Instead, the Company recognizes the lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nAs a lessor, the Company applies the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component and instead accounts for those components as a single component if the non-lease components otherwise would be accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification 606,\nRevenue From Contracts With Customers\n(“ASC 606”), and both of the following criteria are met: 1) the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease component or components and associated lease component are the same; and 2) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. If the non-lease component or components associated with the lease component are the predominant component of the combined component, the Company accounts for the combined component in accordance with ASC 606. Otherwise, the Company accounts for the combined component as an operating lease in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 842,\nLeases\n(“ASC 842”).\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to the Company’s operations.\nIn October 2021, t\nhe FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-08,\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities From Contracts With Customers\n(\n“ASU 2021-08”\n). ASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n(\n“ASC 805”\n)\n,\nto require acquiring entities to apply ASC 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination. Under ASC 805, an acquirer generally recognizes such items at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 2, 2023 and will apply the guidance on business combinations beginning in fiscal year 2023.\nNote 2:\nRevenue\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct - i.e., if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products, extended warranties, and services. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices by reference to the amount charged for similar items on a stand-alone basis.\nThe Company sells products and services predominantly through its direct sales force. As a result, the use of distributors is generally limited to geographic regions where the Company has no direct sales force. The Company does not offer product return or exchange rights (other than those relating to defective goods under warranty) or price protection allowances to its customers, including distributors. Payment terms granted to distributors are the same as those granted to end-customers and payments are not dependent upon the distributor's receipt of payment from their end-user customers.\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company determined that the contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of its invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing products and services, rather than to receive financing from the customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year software licenses or software subscriptions that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. In limited circumstances where the Company provides the customer with a\n57\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nsignificant benefit of financing, the Company uses the practical expedient and only adjusts the transaction price for the effects of the time value of money and only on contracts where the duration of financing is more than one year.\nNature of goods and services\nThe Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment of the Company principally generates revenue from sales of instruments, reagents, informatics, software, subscriptions, detection and imaging technologies, extended warranties, training and services in the life sciences market and instruments, consumables and services in the applied markets. The Diagnostics segment of the Company principally generates revenue from sales of instruments, solutions, consumables, reagents, extended warranties and services in the diagnostics market. Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical length of a contract for service is 12 to 36 months.\nThe revenue generated from the sale of instruments, consumables, reagents, and certain software is recognized at a point in time. The Company recognizes revenue in these arrangements at the point in time when control of the products has been transferred to customers, which is typically at delivery. Certain of the Company's products require specialized installation and configuration at the customer's site. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is complete and customer acceptance has been received. When the Company places the instrument at the customer's site and sells the reagents to a customer, the instrument and reagents are accounted for together as one performance obligation. The Company does not charge a fee for the use of the instrument and retains ownership of the placed instrument. The Company has a right to remove the instrument and replace it with another instrument at the customer’s site at any time throughout the contract term. The Company recognizes revenue upon delivery of reagents, which is the point in time where the Company has performed its obligation to provide a screening solution to the customer. Payment terms and conditions vary, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\nThe revenue generated from the sale of licenses for software as a service, cloud services, subscriptions, extended warranties, and laboratory services and training is recognized over time. Term licenses, subscriptions and cloud services, are generally recognized ratably over the contract period or based upon consumption. The Company sells its software subscriptions and cloud services with maintenance services and, in some cases, with consulting services. The Company recognizes revenue for the software commencing when the service is made available to the customer. For maintenance and consulting services, revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which the services are provided. Revenue for laboratory services is recognized over the contract period or when the service is billable, based on time and materials. Payment terms and conditions vary, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\nProduct revenue is recognized at a point in time and all service revenue is recognized over time.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nIn the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market, end-markets and timing of revenue recognition.\n58\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nMajor Customer Concentration\nRevenues from one customer in the Company’s Diagnostics segment represent approximately $\n330.7\nmillion, $\n638.6\nmillion\nand\n$\n97.8\nmillion\nof the Company’s total revenue during the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nContract Balances\nContract assets:\nThe unbilled receivables (contract assets) primarily relate to the Company’s right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The unbilled receivables are transferred to trade receivables when billed to customers. Contract assets are generally classified as current assets and are included in “Accounts receivable, net” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities:\nThe contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for products and related services for which transfer of control has not occurred at the balance sheet date. Contract liabilities are classified as either current in “Accounts payable” or “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” or as long-term in “Long-term liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize revenue. The contract liability balances at the beginning of each period presented were generally fully recognized in the subsequent three month period.\nContract balances were as follows:\nNote 3:\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions in fiscal year 2022\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of two businesses for aggregate consideration of $\n13.3\nmillion. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of\n5\nyears.\nAcquisitions in fiscal year 2021\nAcquisition of BioLegend, Inc.\nIn fiscal year 2021, t\nhe Company completed the acquisition of BioLegend, Inc. (\n“\nBioLegend\n”\n) and paid an aggregate consideration\nof\n$\n5.7\nbillion, net of cash acquired of $\n292.4\nmillion, reflecting working capital and other adjustments (the\n“\nAggregate Consideration\n”\n). The Aggregate Consideration was paid in a combination of $\n3.3\nbillion in cash and shares of the Company\n’\ns common stock having a fair value of approximately $\n2.6\nbillion based on the $\n187.56\nper share closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2021 (the\n“\nStock Consideration\n”\n). The Stock Consideration consisted of\n14,066,799\nshares of the Company\n’\ns common stock.\nBioLegend is recognized as\na leading, global provider of life science antibodies and reagents headquartered in San Diego, California, with approximately\n700\nemployees.\nThe operations for this acquisition is reported within the results of\nthe Company\n’\ns\nDiscovery & Analytical Solutions segment from the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and is not tax deductible. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names, customer relationships and clone library, acquired as part of this acquisition had a weighted-average amortization period\nof\n16.3\nyears.\nBioLegend’s revenue and net loss for the period from the acquisition date to January 2, 2022 were $\n91.7\nmillion and $\n25.8\nmillion, respectively. The net loss includes $\n47.0\nmillion of amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined financial results for the Company and BioLegend as if the acquisition of BioLegend had been completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2020:\n59\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe unaudited pro forma information for fiscal year 2021 has been calculated after applying the Company’s accounting policies and the impact of acquisition date fair value adjustments. The fiscal year 2021 unaudited pro forma income from continuing operations was adjusted to exclude approximately $\n43.2\nmillion of acquisition-related transaction costs and $\n23.3\nmillion of costs of bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedges that were recognized in expense during fiscal year 2021. The fiscal year 2020 unaudited pro forma income from continuing operations was adjusted to include these acquisition-related transaction costs and the nonrecurring expenses related to the bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedging costs and fair value adjustments as if those expenses were incurred in fiscal year 2020. These pro forma condensed consolidated financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments, such as fair value adjustment to inventory, increased interest expense on debt obtained to finance the transaction, and increased amortization for the fair value of acquired intangible assets.\nThe pro forma information does not reflect the effect of costs or synergies that would have been expected to result from the integration of the acquisition. The pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the combination occurred at the beginning of each period presented, or of future results of the consolidated entities. The actual results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors.\nOther acquisitions in 2021.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company also completed the acquisition of seven other businesses for aggregate consideration of $\n1.2\nbillion. The acquired businesses include Oxford Immunotec Global PLC, a company based in Abingdon, UK with approximately\n275\nemployees, for total consideration of $\n590.9\nmillion and Nexcelom Bioscience Holdings, LLC, a company based in Lawrence, Massachusetts with approximately\n130\nemployees, for total consideration of $\n267.3\nmillion, and five other businesses, which were acquired for total consideration of $\n318.6\nmillion. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as employee workforces acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, which is not tax deductible. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names, and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted-average amortization period of\n12.4\nyears\n.\n60\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2021 has been allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:\nThe Company does not consider the other acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2021 to be material to its consolidated results of operations; therefore, the Company is only presenting pro forma financial information of operations for the BioLegend acquisition. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for the other acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2021 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to January 2, 2022 were not material.\nAcquisitions in fiscal year 2020\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of four businesses for aggregate consideration of $\n438.9\nmillion. The acquired businesses were Horizon Discovery Group plc, a company based in Cambridge, UK with approximately\n400\nemployees, which was acquired on December 23, 2020 for a total consideration of $\n399.8\nmillion (£\n296.0\nmillion), and three other businesses which were acquired for a total consideration of $\n39.1\nmillion. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforces acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, which is not tax deductible. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names, customer relationships and in-process research and development, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of\n11\nyears.\n61\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2020 has been allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:\nThe Company does not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2020 to be material to its consolidated results of operations. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2020 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to January 3, 2021 were not material.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the allocations of purchase prices for all acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were considered final.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company obtained information relevant to determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, related to recent acquisitions and adjusted its purchase price allocations. The adjustments to the preliminary measurements were not material.\nThe accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during the earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $\n106.2\nmillion. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has recorded contingent consideration obligations of $\n46.6\nmillion, of which $\n3.6\nmillion was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $\n43.0\nmillion was recorded in long-term liabilities. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had recorded contingent consideration obligations with an estimated fair value of $\n58.0\nmillion, of which $\n1.3\nmillion was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $\n56.7\nmillion was recorded in long-term liabilities. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods is\n5.9\nyears from January 1, 2023, and the remaining weighted average expected\n62\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nearnout period at January 1, 2023 was\n4.9\nyears. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations.\nTotal acquisition and dive\nstiture-related costs were $\n39.8\nmillion, $\n80.8\nmillion and $\n4.9\nmillion for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. These amounts included $\n26.5\nmillion and $\n6.9\nmillion of stock compensation expense related to awards given to BioLegend employees in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, $\n5.4\nmillion of net foreign exchange gain and $\n23.4\nmillion of costs of bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedges related to the BioLegend acquisition in fiscal year 2021, and $\n0.5\nmillion of acquisition-related interest expenses in fiscal year 2020. These acquisition and divestiture-related costs were expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and interest and other expense, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nNote 4:\nDiscontinued Operations\nAs part of the Company’s continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses. When the discontinued operations represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements, the Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations.\nIn August 2022, the Company entered into a Master Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Polaris Purchaser, L.P. (the “Purchaser”), a Delaware limited partnership owned by funds managed by affiliates of New Mountain Capital L.L.C. (the “Sponsor”), under which the Company agreed to sell to the Purchaser certain assets and the equity interests of certain entities constituting the Company’s Analytical, Food and Enterprise Services businesses (the “Business”) (as further defined in the Purchase Agreement), for cash consideration of up to approximately $\n2.45\nbillion and the Purchaser’s assumption of certain liabilities relating to the Business (collectively, the “Transaction”). Approximately $\n2.30\nbillion of the purchase price will be payable at closing, subject to certain customary adjustments, which includes $\n75.0\nmillion in deferred payments tied to the transfer of the PerkinElmer brand and related trademarks to the Purchaser (which may be completed within 24 months following the date of the closing at the Company’s election). The Purchase Agreement also provides for potential post-closing payments totaling up to $\n150.0\nmillion, which are contingent on the exit valuation the Sponsor and its affiliated funds receive on a sale or other capital events related to the Business. The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nThe Business had been recorded in the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment. The sale of the Business represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities related to the Business as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and its results of operations are classified as income from discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Financial information in this report relating to fiscal years 2021 and 2020 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this discontinued operation.\nThe summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations, were as follows:\nThe carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities included in discontinued operations related to the Business consisted of the following:\n63\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following operating and investing non-cash items from discontinued operations were as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nNote 5:\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consisted of the following for the fiscal years ended:\n64\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 6:\nIncome Taxes\nThe components of income from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nThe components of the provision for income taxes on continuing operations were as follows:\nThe total provision for income taxes included in the consolidated financial statements is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nA reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\n65\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe variation in the Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 is primarily affected by the recognition of $\n37.1\nmillion in U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. taxes related to foreign earnings that the Company no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. During fiscal year 2022, the Company adjusted these estimates and recognized a net benefit of $\n4.9\nmillion relative to its position to permanently reinvest those foreign earnings.\nThe Company also recognized $\n1.1\nmillion of benefit in fiscal year 2022 derived from the tax holiday in Singapore. The Company recognized $\n18.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2021 and $\n12.7\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 of benefits derived from tax holidays in China and Singapore. The effect of these benefits, derived from tax holidays, on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2022 was $\n0.01\nand $\n0.01\n, respectively, for fiscal year 2021 was $\n0.16\nand $\n0.16\n, respectively, and for fiscal year 2020 was $\n0.11\nand $\n0.11\n, respectively. The tax holiday in China is renewed every three years. The Company expects to renew the tax holiday for one of the Company’s subsidiaries in China that is set to expire in fiscal year 2023.\nThe Company regularly reviews its tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits. The Company makes adjustments to its unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.\nThe tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $\n7.2\nmillion and $\n7.6\nmillion, respectively. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized a net (benefit) expense of $(\n0.5\n) million, $\n1.8\nmillion and $\n1.8\nmillion, respectively,\n66\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nfor interest and penalties in its total tax provision. At January 1, 2023, substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $\n17.8\nmillion of its uncertain tax positions at January 1, 2023, including accrued interest and penalties, and net of tax benefits, may be resolved over the next twelve months as a result of lapses in applicable statutes of limitations and potential settlements. Various tax years after 2010 remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations, such as China, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and attributes that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nThe components of net deferred tax liabilities were recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nAt January 1, 2023, for income tax return purposes, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n67.5\nmillion, state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n4.9\nmillion, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n458.0\nmillion, state tax credit carryforwards of $\n13.8\nmillion and general business tax credit carryforwards of $\n0.1\nmillion. Certain net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards do not expire, while other losses begin to expire in 2023.\n67\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nValuation allowances take into consideration limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the likely net realizable amount. The Company regularly evaluates positive and negative evidence available to determine if valuation allowances are required or if existing valuation allowances are no longer required. Valuation allowances have been provided on state net operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards and on certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely tha\nn not to be realized. The increase in the valuation allowance of $\n7.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to net operating losses incurred for which the benefit is not expected to be realized.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the Company evaluated its undistributed foreign earnings and identified approximately $\n879.0\nmillion in earnings that it does not consider to be permanently reinvested. The Company has recorded a provision of approximately $\n15.8\nmillion for the taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated. The Company began repatriating such foreign earnings to the United States in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and expects to continue the repatriation in fiscal year 2023. There are other undistributed foreign earnings and outside basis differences for which the Company has not provided for any taxes as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested, and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability that would be incurred.\nNote 7:\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations for the fiscal years ended:\nAntidilutive securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share and could become dilutive in the future.\nNote 8:\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net consisted of the following:\nReserves for credit losses consisted of the following:\n68\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(1) Other amounts primarily relate to the impact of acquisitions, discontinued operations and foreign exchange movements.\nNote 9:\nInventories\nInventories consisted of the following:\nNote 10:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following:\nDepreciation expense on property, plant and equipment for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 was $\n56.4\nmillion, $\n54.9\nmillion and $\n40.7\nmillion, respectively.\n69\nNote 11:\nMarketable Securities and Investments\nInvestments, which are classified in Other assets, net, consisted of the following:\nMarketable securities.\nMarketable securities include equity and fixed-income securities. The net unrealized holding gain and loss on marketable securities, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity, was not material in fiscal years 2022 and 2021. The proceeds from the sales of securities and the related gains and losses are not material for any period presented.\nMarketable securities classified as available for sale consisted of the following:\nEquity Investments.\nThe Company has equity interests in privately-held entities over which the Company neither has significant influence nor control.\nEquity investments as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 consisted of the following:\nThe amount of upward adjustments during\nfiscal years 2022 and 2021\nwere $\n2.9\nmillion and $\n19.6\nmillion, respectively. The cumulative amount of upward adjustments as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 was $\n30.7\nmillion and $\n27.8\nmillion, respectively. The amount of impairments and downward adjustments during fiscal year 2020 was $\n4.9\nmillion. The cumulative amount of impairments and downward adjustments as of each of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 was $\n5.0\nmillion.\nInvestments in debt securities.\nThe Company has investments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale. The amortized cost of these investments are not materially different to their fair value. Investments with total carrying value of\n$\n25.5\nmillion\nhave contractual maturities of one year through five years. Investments with a carrying value of\n$\n17.0\nmillion\nare convertible into equity securities or are due and payable upon event of default (as defined in the applicable agreement).\nNote 12:\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for possible impairment. The Company completes the annual testing of impairment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on the later of\n70\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nJanuary 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. In addition to its annual test, the Company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nThe process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. The Company performed its annual impairment testing for its reporting units as of\nJanuary 3, 2022\n, its annual impairment testing date for fiscal year 2022. There were no impairments measured in the periods presented. While the Company believes that its estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used, including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which the Company serves, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n71\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nIdentifiable intangible asset balances at January 1, 2023 by category and segment were as follows:\nIdentifiable intangible asset balances at January 2, 2022 by category and segment were as follows:\nTotal amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets was $\n370.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, $\n256.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2021 and $\n161.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2020. Estimated amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for each of the next five years is $\n363.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2023, $\n355.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2024, $\n334.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2025, $\n327.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2026, and $\n299.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2027.\n72\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 13:\nDebt\nThe Company’s debt consisted of the following:\n73\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn August 24, 2021, the Company terminated its previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five-year term and a borrowing capacity o\nf $\n1.5\nbillion available through August 24, 2026. As of January 1, 2023, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $\n7.1\nmillion were treated as issued and outstanding when calculating the borrowing availability under the facility. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had $\n1.49\nbillion available for additional borrowing under the facility. Borrowings will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of an\ny interest period, at the Company\n’\ns option at either (a) the base rate (as defined in the credit agreement), or (b) the eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate), in each case plus a percentage spread based on the credit rating of the Company's debt. The base rate is the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus\n0.50\n%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its\n“prime rate”,\nand (c) the Eurocurrency Rate plus\n1.00\n%\n. T\nhe credit agreement for the new facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. The financial covenants include a debt-to-capital ratio that remains applicable for so long as the Company\n’\ns debt is rated as investment grade. In the event that the Company\n’\ns debt is not rated as investment grade, the debt-to-capital ratio covenant is replaced with leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, the Company repurchased\n$\n32.9\nmillion\nand $\n28.3\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes, respectively, in open market transactions.\nSubsequent to fiscal year 2022, the Company\nrepurchased\n$\n50.5\nmillion\nin aggregate principal amount of the\n2024 Notes in open market transactions.\n74\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of the Company’s indebtedness as of January 1, 2023:\nNote 14:\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following:\nNote 15:\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nSavings Plan:\nThe Company has a 401(k) Savings Plan for the benefit of all qualified U.S. employees, with such employees receiving matching contributions in the amount equal to\n100.0\n% of the first\n5.0\n% of eligible compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. Savings plan expense was $\n20.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, $\n16.5\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, and $\n14.1\nmillion in fiscal year 2020.\nPension Plans:\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees and non-U.S. pension plans for certain non-U.S. employees. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan is closed to new hires and plan benefits have been frozen. The plans provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation near retirement.\nNet periodic pension cost for U.S. and non-U.S. plans included the following components for fiscal years ended:\n75\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses, unless an interim remeasurement is required, in the fourth quarter of the year in which the gains and losses occur. Such adjustments for gains and losses are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the Company’s control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. Actuarial gains and losses, including other components of periodic pension cost, are recognized in the line item “Interest and other expense, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.\n76\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the funded status of the principal U.S. pension plan and the principal non-U.S. pension plans and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022. The pension liability of the Business at the end of fiscal year 2022 that will transfer upon sale was reclassified to discontinued operations, while the prior year was not restated.\nActuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost during the year were as follows:\n77\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company’s expected rate of return on assets assumptions are derived from management’s estimates, as well as other information compiled by management, including studies that utilize customary procedures and techniques. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.\nThe Company’s discount rate assumptions are derived from a range of factors, including a yield curve for certain plans, composed of the rates of return on high-quality fixed-income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and the related expected duration for the obligations, and a bond matching approach for certain plans.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the non-U.S. benefit obligations and fair value of assets for pension plans that have benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:\nAssets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocations as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and target asset allocations for fiscal year 2023 are as follows:\nThe Company maintains target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments.\nThe target allocations for plan assets are listed in the above table. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and mid-cap companies located in the United States and abroad, and equity index funds. Debt securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, high-yield bonds, and U.S. government securities. Other types of investments include investments in non-U.S. government index linked bonds, multi-strategy hedge funds and venture capital funds that follow several different strategies.\n78\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 by asset category, classified in the three levels of inputs described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nValuation Techniques:\nValuation techniques utilized need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There have been no changes in the methodologies utilized at January 1, 2023 compared to January 2, 2022. The following is a description of the valuation techniques utilized to measure the fair value of the assets shown in the table above.\nEquity Securities:\nShares of registered investment companies that are publicly traded are categorized as Level 1 assets; they are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of the fund. These instruments have active markets.\nEquity index funds are mutual funds that are not publicly traded and are comprised primarily of underlying equity securities that are publicly traded on exchanges. Price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily observable and available. Equity index funds are categorized as Level 2 assets.\nFixed Income Securities:\nFixed income mutual funds that are publicly traded are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of securities held by the fund and are categorized as Level 1 assets.\n79\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nFixed income index funds that are not publicly traded are stated at net asset value as determined by the issuer of the fund based on the fair value of the underlying investments and are categorized as Level 2 assets.\nIndividual fixed income bonds are categorized as Level 2 assets except where sufficient quoted prices exist in active markets, in which case such securities are categorized as Level 1 assets. These securities are valued using third-party pricing services. These services may use, for example, model-based pricing methods that utilize observable market data as inputs. Broker dealer bids or quotes of securities with similar characteristics may also be used.\nOther Types of Investments:\nHedge funds, private equity funds, foreign real estate funds and venture capital funds are valued at fair value by using the net asset values provided by the investment managers and are updated, if necessary, using analytical procedures, appraisals, public market data and/or inquiry of the investment managers. The net asset values are determined based upon the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. These other investments invest primarily in readily available marketable securities and allocate gains, losses, and expense to the investor based on the ownership percentage as described in the fund agreements. They are categorized as Level 3 assets.\nIn September 2021, the Company’s UK pension scheme executed a buy-in contract with Phoenix Life LTD (“Phoenix”), under which the Company made an upfront payment to Phoenix in exchange for Phoenix agreeing to make the benefit payments under the Company’s UK pension scheme due to specified participants and their beneficiaries, thus transferring most of the investment and longevity risk associated with the covered participants and beneficiaries from the Company to Phoenix. This buy-in contract can be considered a liability-driven investment (“LDI”) solution that hedges not only the investment risk but also the longevity risk under the Company’s UK pension scheme. Like other LDI solutions, it does not eliminate ongoing administrative costs.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize significant transfers between levels at the actual date of the event.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 assets for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nWith respect to plans outside of the United States, the Company expects to contribute $\n6.8\nmillion in the aggregate during fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2023, the Company contributed $\n10.0\nmillion to its defined benefit pension plan in the United States for the plan year 2022.\n80\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:\nThe Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the projected benefit obligations were $\n18.9\nmillion and $\n24.1\nmillion, respectively. Assets with a fair value of $\n0.9\nmillion and $\n1.6\nmillion, segregated in a trust (which is included in marketable securities and investments on the consolidated balance sheets), were available to meet this obligation as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. Pension expenses and income for this plan netted to income of $\n3.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, expense of $\n0.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2021 and expense of $\n2.1\nmillion in fiscal year 2020.\nPostretirement Medical Plans:\nThe Company provides healthcare benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. Eligible U.S. employees qualify for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities and are available only to pay retiree health benefits. The costs of these plans are not material and the net assets in the plans totaled $\n17.1\nmillion and $\n20.7\nmillion at January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nNote 16:\nContingencies\nThe Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations of the Company and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company’s responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $\n12.2\nmillion and $\n11.9\nmillion as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which represents its management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. The Company’s environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to\nten\nyears. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at January 1, 2023 should not have a material\n81\nadverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.\nNote 17:\nStock Plans\nStock-Based Compensation:\nThe Company’s 2019 Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) authorizes the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and cash awards as part of the Company’s compensation programs. The 2019 Plan replaced the Company’s 2009 Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). Upon shareholder approval of the 2019 Plan,\n6.25\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock, as well as shares of the Company’s common stock previously granted under the 2009 Plan that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, canceled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price subject to a contractual repurchase right, became available for grant under the 2019 Plan. Awards granted under the 2009 Plan prior to its expiration remain outstanding. As part of the Company’s compensation programs, the Company also offers shares of its common stock under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nThe following table summarizes total pre-tax compensation expense recognized related to the Company’s stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units, performance units and stock grants, included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nThe total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation was $\n12.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, $\n12.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2021 and $\n18.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2020. Stock-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were immaterial in all periods presented.\nStock Options:\nThe Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of\nthree years\n, and will generally expire\nseven years\nafter the date of grant. Options replaced in association with business combination transactions are generally issued with the same terms of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic exercise experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant.\nThe Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the fiscal years ended:\n82\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding at January 1, 2023 was $\n24.4\nmillion with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of\n4.7\nyears. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercisable at January 1, 2023 was $\n20.1\nmillion with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of\n3.6\nyears. At January 1, 2023, there\nwere\n0.6\nmillion stock\noptions that were expected to vest in the future, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $\n4.3\nmillion and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of\n5.6\nyears.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n48.09\n, $\n40.00\n, and $\n18.98\nper share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n13.9\nmillion, $\n32.4\nmillion, and $\n51.1\nmillion, respectively. Cash received from option exercises for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n14.1\nmillion, $\n25.1\nmillion, and $\n37.7\nmillion, respectively. The total compensation expense recognized related to the Company’s outstanding options was $\n9.5\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, $\n5.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2021 and $\n3.1\nmillion in fiscal year 2020.\nThere was $\n15.3\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted as of January 1, 2023. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.9\nyears.\nRestricted Stock Awards:\nThe Company has awarded shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors at no cost to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction period. The restricted stock and restricted stock units vest through the passage of time, assuming continued employment. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses over the vesting period, which is generally\n3\nyears. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock award activity for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023:\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards vested during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n32.8\nmillion, $\n11.6\nmillion, and $\n14.0\nmillion, respectively. The total compensation expense recognized related to the restricted stock awards was $\n34.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, $\n16.3\nmillion in fiscal year 2021 and $\n8.7\nmillion in fiscal year 2020.\nAs of January 1, 2023, there was $\n43.5\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost, related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.3\nyears.\n83\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan:\nIn April 1999, the Company’s shareholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the “Board”) voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating employees have the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to\n95\n% of the closing price on the last day of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed\n10\n% of the employee’s base compensation. During fiscal year 2022, the Company issued\n30,818\nshares of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted-average price of $\n134.05\nper share. During fiscal year 2021, the Company issued\n21,578\nshares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $\n168.11\nper share. During fiscal year 2020, the Company issued\n38,727\nshares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $\n105.23\nper share. At January 1, 2023 there remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of\n0.7\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock out of the\n5.0\nmillion shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under this plan.\nNote 18:\nStockholders’ Equity\nComprehensive Income:\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income consisted of the following:\nStock Repurchases:\nOn July 31, 2020, the Company\n’\ns Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized the Company to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $\n250.0\nmillion under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On July 22, 2022, the Repurchase Program was terminated by the Board and the Board authorized the Company to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $\n300.0\nmillion under a new stock repurchase program (the\n“\nNew Repurchase Program\n”\n). No shares remain available for repurchase under the Repurchase Program due to its termination. The New Repurchase Pro\ngram will expire on July 22, 2024 unless terminated earlier by the Board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2022\n, the Company repurchased\n240,000\nshares of common stock under the Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of $\n43.4\nmillion.\nDuring fiscal year 2022\n, the Company\nrepurchased\n138,025\nshares of common stock under the New Repurchase Program for an aggregate cost of\n$\n19.1\nmillion\n. As of January 1, 2023,\n$\n280.9\nmillion\nremained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the New Repurchase Program.\nIn addition, the Board has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans. During fiscal year 2022, the Company repurchased\n115,247\nshares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $\n18.1\nmillion. During fiscal year 2021, the Company repurchased\n71,248\nshares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $\n10.5\nmillion. During fiscal year 2020, the Company repurchased\n72,251\nshares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $\n6.9\nmillion. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.\n84\nDividends:\nThe Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.07\nper share in each quarter of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020. At January 1, 2023, the Company had accrued $\n8.8\nmillion for a dividend declared in October 2022 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that was paid in February 2023. On\nJanuary 26, 2023\n, the Company announced that the Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $\n0.07\nper share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 that will be payable in May 2023. In the future, the Board may determine to reduce or eliminate the Company’s common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.\nNote 19:\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and has policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately\n55\n% of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed\n12\nmonths, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nPrincipal hedged currencies include the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee, Singapore Dollar and Swedish Krona. The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling $\n476.9\nmillion at January 1, 2023 $\n371.9\nmillion at January 2, 2022, and $\n808.0\nmillion at January 3, 2021, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally\n30\ndays or less during each of fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nIn addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance its acquisitions and stock repurchase program, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Company records these hedges at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements, included combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $\n360.2\nmillion as of January 2, 2022. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material.\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company designated a portion of the 2026 Notes to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 Notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of January 1, 2023, the total notional amount of the 2026 Notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €\n497.2\nmillion. The unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses recorded in AOCI related to the ne\nt investment hedge were $(\n34.5\n) million, $(\n33.2\n) million and $\n49.6\nmillion during the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company does\nno\nt expect any material net pre-tax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into interest and other expense, net within the next twelve months.\n85\nNote 20:\nFair Value Measurements\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, derivatives, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 1, 2023.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of marketable securities, derivative contracts used to hedge the Company’s currency risk, and acquisition related contingent consideration. The Company has not elected to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value.\nValuation Hierarchy:\nThe following summarizes the three levels of inputs required to measure fair value. For Level 1 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices as these instruments have active markets. For Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or utilizes alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. For Level 3 inputs, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based on the best information available, including estimates by management primarily based on information provided by third-party fund managers, independent brokerage firms and insurance companies. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible.\nThe following tables show the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 classified in one of the three classifications described above:\nLevel 1 and Level 2 Valuation Techniques:\nThe Company’s Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities are comprised of investments in equity and fixed-income securities as well as derivative contracts. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including common stock price quotes, foreign exchange forward prices and bank price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities.\nMarketable securities:\nInclude equity and fixed-income securities measured at fair value using the quoted market prices in active markets at the reporting date.\nForeign exchange derivative assets and liabilities:\nInclude foreign exchange derivative contracts that are valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date. The Company’s foreign exchange derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements that allow the Company and its counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled under these arrangements have been presented in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a net basis and are recorded in other assets. As of both January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, none of the master netting arrangements involved collateral.\n86\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nLevel 3 Valuation Techniques:\nThe Company’s Level 3 liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration related to acquisitions. For liabilities that utilize Level 3 inputs, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 3 liabilities.\nContingent consideration:\nContingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date using projected milestone dates, discount rates, probabilities of success and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected risk-adjusted contingent payments are discounted back to the current period using a discounted cash flow model.\nThe fair values of contingent consideration are calculated on a quarterly basis based on a collaborative effort of the Company’s regulatory, research and development, operations, finance and accounting groups, as appropriate. Potential valuation adjustments are made as additional information becomes available, including the progress towards achieving proof of concept, regulatory approvals and revenue targets as compared to initial projections, the impact of market competition and market landscape shifts from non-invasive prenatal testing products, with the impact of such adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods that are substantially all revenue-based consideration, of up to $\n106.2\nmillion. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency period is\n5.9\nyears from January 1, 2023, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at January 1, 2023\nwas\n4.9\nyears.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 net liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\nAssets and Liabilities Not Carried at Fair Value\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. If measured at fair value, cash and cash equivalents would be classified as Level 1.\nThe Company’s outstanding senior unsecured notes had an aggregate fair value of $\n3,812.3\nmillion and aggregate carrying value of $\n4,390.5\nmillion as of January 1, 2023. The Company's outstanding senior unsecured notes had an aggregate fair value of $\n4,612.8\nmillion and aggregate carrying value of $\n4,479.5\nmillion as of January 2, 2022. The fair values of the outstanding senior unsecured notes were estimated using market quotes from brokers and were based on current rates offered for similar debt, which are Level 2 measurements.\nThe Company’s other debt facilities, including the Company's senior revolving credit facility and term loan facility, had an aggregate carrying value of $\n3.7\nmillion and $\n504.5\nmillion as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. The carrying value approximates fair value and were classified as Level 2.\n87\nNote 21:\nLeases\nLessee Disclosures\nThe Company leases certain property and equipment under operating and finance leases. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the lease within 1 year. Finance leases are not material to the Company.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nLease costs from finance leases, short-term leases, variable lease costs and sub-lease income are not material.\n88\nFuture payments of operating lease liabilities as of January 1, 2023 were as follows:\nNote 22:\nIndustry Segment and Geographic Area Information\nThe Company discloses information about its operating segments based on the way that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and operating income. Intersegment revenue and transfers are not significant. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1.\nThe principal products and services of the Company’s\ntwo\noperating segments are:\n•\nDiscovery & Analytical Solutions\n.  Provides products and services targeted towards the life sciences and applied markets.\n•\nDiagnostics\n.  Develops diagnostics, tools and applications focused on clinically-oriented customers, especially within the reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and applied genomics markets. The Diagnostics segment serves the diagnostics market.\nThe Company has included the expenses for its corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. The Company has a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in the Company’s calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of the Company’s operating segments.\nThe primary financial measure by which the Company evaluates the performance of its segments is adjusted operating income, which consists of operating income plus amortization of intangible assets, adjustments to operations arising from purchase accounting (primarily adjustments to the fair value of acquired inventory that are subsequently recognized), acquisition and divestiture-related costs, and other costs that are not expected to recur or are of a non-cash nature, including primarily restructuring actions.\n89\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nRevenue and operating income (loss) from continuing operations by operating segment are shown in the table below for the fiscal years ended:\nAdditional information relating to the Company’s reporting segments is as follows for the three fiscal years ended January 1, 2023:\nThe following geographic area information for continuing operations includes revenue based on location of external customers for the three fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 and net long-lived assets based on physical location as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022:\n90\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(1) Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, net, operating lease right-of-use assets, rental equipment, software and other long-term assets.\n91\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 23:\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nSelected quarterly financial information is as follows for the fiscal years ended:"

    "text": "Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n92\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 1, 2023. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 1, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n.\nBased on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of January 1, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nOur registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the effect of the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness.\n93\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of PerkinElmer, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PerkinElmer, Inc. and sub\nsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 1, 2023 of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMarch 1, 2023\n94"
