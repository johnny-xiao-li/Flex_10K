    "text": "Background\nAs used in this report, except where the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Moody’s” or the “Company” refer to Moody’s Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are located at 7 World Trade Center at 250 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10007 and its telephone number is (212) 553-0300.\nTHE COMPANY\nCompany Overview\nMoody’s is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations and investors to make better decisions. Moody’s reports activities in two segments: MIS and MA. Financial information and operating results of these segments, including revenue, expenses and Adjusted Operating Income, are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements of this annual report and are herein incorporated by reference.\n10\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMoody's Investors Service Overview\nMoody's Investors Service (MIS) publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities. A rating from MIS enables issuers to create timely, go-to-market debt strategies in order to capture wider investor focus and deeper liquidity options.\nRatings revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use MIS ratings to support the distribution of their debt issues to investors. Ratings are disseminated via press releases to the public primarily through a variety of electronic media, including the internet and real-time information systems widely used by securities traders and investors.\nMIS also generates revenue from certain non-ratings-related operations, which primarily consist of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region, revenue from ESG research, data and assessments and revenue from ICRA's non-ratings operations. The revenue from these operations is included in the MIS Other LOB and is not material to the results of the MIS segment.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     11\nMoody's Analytics Overview\nMoody's Analytics (MA) is a global provider of: i) data and information; ii) research and insights; and iii) decision solutions, which help customers navigate increasingly complex risks. MA leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks such as credit, market, financial crime, supply chain, catastrophe and climate to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities. MA’s proprietary data, research and analytics combined with cloud-based software tools deliver solutions to meet customer needs as they arise. MA’s subscription businesses provide a significant base of recurring revenue to mitigate cyclical changes in debt issuance volumes that may result in volatility in MIS’s revenues.\n12\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nSustainability\nMoody’s manages its business with the goal of delivering value to all of its stakeholders, including but not limited to, its customers, employees, business partners, local communities and stockholders. As part of this effort, Moody’s advances sustainability by considering environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors in its operations, products and services. The Company uses its expertise and assets to make a positive difference through technology tools, research and analytical services that help other organizations and the investor community better understand the links between sustainability considerations and the global markets. Moody’s efforts to promote sustainability-related thought leadership, assessments and data to market participants include adhering to the policies of recognized sustainability organizations that develop standards or frameworks and/or evaluate and assess performance, including: the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB); and the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s Stakeholder Capitalism metrics. Moody's also issues an annual report on Stakeholder Sustainability and its implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations. Moody’s sustainability-related achievements in 2022 included the following:\n–\nValidated Moody’s long-term net-zero targets with SBTi;\n–\nRolled out an all-employee training on Sustainability and ESG;\n–\nReceived the following awards/recognition: i) featured on the 2022 CDP ‘A List’ for Climate Action for third consecutive year; ii) included in FTSE4Good Index Series for the fourth consecutive year; iii) received ‘Net Zero Transition’ award from Reuters Responsible Business; iv) named ‘Climate Leader’ by the Finance of the Future Awards; v) awarded 'Best ESG Reporting (large-cap)' from IR Magazine U.S. 2022; vi) received ‘Sustainability reporting of the year – Americas’ from Environmental Finance Company Awards 2022; and vii) included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time;\n–\nPublished Moody’s 2021 Stakeholder Sustainability report and 2021 TCFD report; and\n–\nIssued a global tax policy.\nThe Board oversees sustainability matters, with assistance from the Audit, Governance & Nominating and Compensation & Human Resources Committees, as part of its oversight of management and the Company’s overall strategy. The Audit Committee oversees financial, risk and other disclosures made in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports related to sustainability and has overseen the expanded voluntary disclosures the Company has made in its periodic filings. The Governance & Nominating Committee oversees sustainability matters, including significant issues of corporate social and environmental responsibility, as they pertain to the Company’s business and to long-term value creation for the Company and its stockholders, and makes recommendations to the Board regarding these issues. This has helped to develop the Company’s robust ESG strategy. Finally, the Compensation & Human Resources Committee oversees inclusion of sustainability-related performance goals for determining compensation of all senior executives. This oversight has resulted in the Company more fully integrating sustainability-related performance metrics into the strategic & operational compensation metric of all senior executives. The Board also oversees Moody’s policies for assessing and managing the Company's exposure to risk, including climate-related risks such as business continuity disruption and reputational or credibility concerns stemming from incorporation of climate-related risks into the credit methodologies and credit ratings of MIS.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     13\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nMoody's believes that a workforce representing an array of backgrounds and experiences helps create an environment that maximizes every employee’s contribution, widens the leadership pipeline and enhances our work, including the quality of our opinions, products and services.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the number of Moody’s employees was as follows:\n–\nThe MIS employee population primarily consists of credit analysts, data and operations analysts, credit strategy and methodology professionals, software engineers, sales and sales operations, and international strategy teams.\n–\nMA’s employee population primarily consists of software engineers, data and operation analysts, advisory and implementation teams and economists, as well as sales and sales support professionals.\n–\nThe MSS employee population primarily consists of information technology professionals and other professional staff such as finance, human resources and legal that support both MIS and MA.\nAs a global integrated risk assessment firm, attracting, supporting and retaining skilled talent is essential to the Company’s success. Moody’s addresses these goals by:\n–\nchampioning DE&I among employees;\n–\nproviding market-competitive compensation, benefits and wellness programs; and\n–\nadvancing employee engagement, including supporting employee learning, development and skills enhancement.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\nMoody's believes it is imperative to be visible champions of DE&I because differing thoughts and perspectives help to enrich the Company’s offerings to its many stakeholders and improve performance and retention. The key objectives for which the Company focuses with respect to these items include:\n–\nincorporating DE&I into Moody’s business strategy;\n–\nestablishing leadership accountability with respect to diversity, including through executive compensation programs;\n–\nworking to increase diverse representation (e.g., women and underrepresented groups);\n–\ncontinuing to advance women and underrepresented employees in leadership roles;\n–\nenhancing employee training in DE&I matters;\n–\npromoting equal employment opportunities in all aspects of employment;\n–\ndesigning the Company’s compensation practices to provide equal pay for equal work; and\n–\nincorporating market standards, role, experience and performance into compensation decisions.\nThe executive leadership team’s focus on these items is vital to attract, support and retain its skilled talent. Additionally, an Executive Diversity Council is tasked with overseeing the implementation and progression of the DE&I strategy and goals across our business. Chaired by our CEO and composed of senior leaders who are committed to DE&I best practices, the members of the council meet quarterly so that DE&I policies are an ongoing focus throughout the company.\n14\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMoody’s has numerous diversity programs and eleven active business resource groups (“BRGs”) that contribute to a more effective and inclusive work environment by fostering the recruitment, development and retention of diverse and talented individuals. The BRGs represent 53 chapters and more than 3,600 employees participating globally as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s diversity programs are designed to expand Moody’s talent pipeline and include the TIDE program (Talent Aspirations & Alignment, Insights, Development & Career Planning and Exposure & Expansion), which is a high potential employee diversity initiative aimed at elevating women and ethnically diverse employees at the Senior Vice President/Senior Director level and above; and RISE, a global program for women at the Vice President/Director level focused on addressing the unique challenges of women in the workplace.\nThe Company provides and periodically updates information on its BRGs and other diversity, inclusion and equity programs in its various sustainability and stakeholder reports and on its DE&I microsite. See\nmoodys.com/sustainability\nand\nmoodys.com/diversity\nfor these items. The content of those websites is not incorporated by reference herein.\nThe charts below present additional information regarding the diversity of the Company's workforce as of December 31, 2022. The percentage for people of color (\"POC\") includes those who identified as Asian, Hispanic, Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hawaiian/Other Pacific Island or two or more races. Officers and Managers are calculated using the job categories: executives, senior managers, mid-level managers, and first-level managers. The following data is based on Company records and may involve estimates or assumptions.\n(1)\nTotal officers and managers by gender represents approximately 90% of employees (excludes certain non-wholly-owned subsidiaries and newly acquired companies for which this data was not available).\nAdditionally, approximately 27% of our Board of Directors identified as female and 27% as POC.\nCompensation, Health and Wellness\nMoody’s compensation programs are designed to foster and maintain a strong, capable, experienced and motivated global workforce. An important element of the Company’s compensation philosophy is aligning compensation to local market standards so that Moody's can attract and retain the highly-skilled talent needed to thrive. The Company’s compensation packages include market-competitive salaries, annual bonuses and equity grants for certain employees.\nWith respect to benefits, the Company views investments in benefits as an investment in its people. Moody’s is committed to providing competitive benefits programs designed to care for all employees and their families. The Company’s comprehensive programs offer resources for physical and mental health that promote preventive care, awareness and support for a healthy\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     15\nlifestyle. Beyond delivering health, welfare, retirement benefits, and paid vacation and sick days, Moody’s extends other benefits to support its employees and their families, such as parental leave and educational support.\nThe Company also promotes flexible work arrangements, which support the Company’s efforts to create a work atmosphere in which people feel valued and inspired to give their best. To balance the needs of Moody's employees and business, the Company has implemented a \"PurposeFirst\" framework, which fosters purpose-driven decisions relating to how and where Moody's teams work.\nTalent Management, Employee Engagement and Retention\nMoody’s talent management framework includes learning and development, talent acquisition, performance management, total rewards, succession planning and leadership development. Each of these areas supports the Company’s business strategy and Moody’s culture as a diverse, equitable and inclusive place to work. Moody's views learning and development as an investment in its people that aligns their professional goals and interests with the success of the Company and helps to retain talent over the longer-term. A number of training programs are available, including leadership development, professional skills development, and technical skills.\nThe Company measures employee engagement via multiple channels, including a Business Engagement Survey (BES) for employees to provide anonymous and candid feedback to management. This periodic survey helps Moody's management understand our employees’ level of engagement in critical areas, which include, but are not limited to: company strategy; opportunities for employee development; and work/life balance. Managers are accountable for identifying opportunity areas and taking targeted actions based on survey results. The feedback received through the BES is used as a vital input into making decisions to improve employee experience and retention.\nManagement monitors employee turnover rates as presented in the chart below:\nThe increase in the Company's voluntary turnover rates in 2022 compared to 2021 is likely due to the overall strength of the global labor market for much of 2022, especially for technology-related jobs. The increase in the Company's involuntary turnover rates in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to the 2022-2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program, which resulted in a reduction in staff, including the relocation of certain job functions.\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nClimate change is a defining issue of our time, and while Moody’s has a limited direct environmental impact, we do nonetheless have an important role to play in demonstrating proactive corporate responsibility and best practices when it comes to climate change mitigation. As such, the Company is taking steps to achieve its commitment to net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2040 by publishing its TCFD report on an annual basis, issuing its decarbonization plan and taking actions to achieve its near and long-term net-zero targets.\nMoody’s Decarbonization Plan outlines tangible strategies for realizing its climate ambitions, including the procurement of 100% of renewable electricity in the Company’s office spaces and optimizing efficiencies in its operations through its hybrid work program. The costs associated with the implementation of the Decarbonization Plan are not expected to be material.\nFurthermore, Moody’s has invested in acquisitions, including RMS, that expand its climate data and analytics capabilities further. To integrate these capabilities into existing offerings, Moody’s is enhancing its technology infrastructure to provide its analysts and researchers with streamlined access to consistent and high-quality climate insights. These enhancements will allow Moody’s to seamlessly integrate climate considerations into its solutions to enable sustainable decision-making.\n16\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMOODY’S STRATEGY\nMoody's is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations to make better decisions. Our data, analytical solutions and insights help decision-makers identify opportunities and manage the risks of doing business with others.\nMoody’s invests in initiatives to implement the Company’s strategy, including internally-led organic development and targeted acquisitions. Illustrative examples include:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     17\nPROSPECTS FOR GROWTH\nMoody’s believes that the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued growth of the global fixed-income market and related financial information market, which includes information such as credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services.\nMoody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact financial information markets including:\nIn an environment of increasing financial complexity and heightened attention to credit analysis and risk management, Moody’s is well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixed-income market activity and more widespread use of credit ratings, research and related analytical products. Moody’s expects that these developments will support continued long-term demand for high quality, independent credit opinions, research, data, analytics, risk management tools and related services. Moreover, pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in information technology present growth opportunities for Moody’s.\nMoody’s operations are subject to various risks, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” inherent in conducting business on a global basis. Such risks include currency fluctuations and possible nationalization, expropriation, exchange and price controls, changes in the availability of data from public sector sources, limits on providing information across borders and other restrictive governmental actions.\nMIS Prospects for Growth\nStrong secular trends should continue to provide long-term growth opportunities in MIS. Key growth drivers include:\n18\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nIn addition to the factors noted above, growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including:\nRating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS’s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual debt monitoring fees and annual fees from commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank deposit ratings, insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas partially mitigate MIS’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets.\nMA Prospects for Growth\nAs an integrated risk assessment business, MA helps customers build resilience by providing tools to measure the financial implications of risk and capitalize on related opportunities. Growth in MA is likely to be driven by expansion across customer sectors fostered by a broadening of MA's data, analytics and software solutions to meet an expanded set of customer use cases.\nMA’s business growth is driven by a number of factors, including:\nMoody’s expects that MA products and services that measure and manage risk, provide business insights, and enable compliance with financial regulation, including AML, KYC, and accounting standards, will continue to be in demand from institutions worldwide. To respond to other sources of demand and drive growth, MA is actively investing in new product innovation, enhanced data sets and improved delivery services (e.g., software-as-a-service). These efforts should support broader distribution of MA’s capabilities, deepen relationships with existing customers and drive new customer acquisition.\nCompetition\nMIS competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MIS’s ratings also have in-house credit research capabilities. There are also some rating markets, based on industry, geography and/or instrument type, in which Moody’s has made investments and obtained market positions superior to its competitors, while in other markets, the reverse is true.\nMA competes broadly in the financial information and enterprise risk software industries against various diversified competitors. MA’s main competitors within Decision Solutions are providers of software and analytic solutions. In Research & Insights, MA faces competition from providers of economic data, financial research and analysis. MA's main competitors within Data & Information are providers of commercial and financial data.\nRegulation\nMIS, certain of the Company's credit rating affiliates and many of the issuers and/or securities that MIS and the affiliates rate, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., EU and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). In addition, some of the services offered by MA and its affiliates are subject to regulation in a number of countries. MA also derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight and who are required to pass through certain regulatory requirements to key suppliers such as MA. Existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations, products and the markets in which the Company operates. Additional laws and regulations have been proposed or are being considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the Company’s operations, including the issuance of credit ratings, and may negatively impact the Company’s profitability and ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for the Company's products and services, in the manner in which the Company's products and services are utilized and in the manner in which the Company operates.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     19\nIn the U.S., CRAs are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to the Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Reform Act added Section 15E to the Exchange Act and provided the SEC with the authority to establish a registration and oversight program for CRAs registered as NRSROs. The Dodd-Frank Act added additional provisions to Section 15E.\nIn the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a pan-EU regulatory framework. ESMA has direct supervisory responsibility for registered CRAs throughout the EU. MIS’s EU CRA subsidiaries are registered and are subject to CRA regulation in the EU and periodic inspection by ESMA. From time to time, ESMA publishes interpretive guidance, or thematic reports regarding various aspects of the CRA regulation and, annually, sets out its work program for the forthcoming year. The Commission is moving forward with their sustainable finance strategy which was released in July 2021. This includes further assessments in respect of both CRAs and sustainability ratings and research, which might lead to legislative action.\nOn December 31, 2020, the MIS U.K. registered CRA ceased to be registered with and regulated by ESMA and became subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Regulatory arrangements also came into effect in both the U.K. and the EU to allow credit ratings to be available for regulatory use in both the EU and the U.K. MIS has put arrangements in place to endorse its U.K. credit ratings into the EU and its EU credit ratings into the U.K. The FCA has recently stated that it intends to launch a review of competition in the market for credit rating data feeds during the first quarter of 2023. The U.K. Government is also considering bringing ESG data and ratings firms within the scope of FCA authorization and regulation.\nIntellectual Property\nMoody’s and its affiliates own and control a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to:\nManagement of Moody’s believes that each of the trademarks and related corporate names, marks and logos relating to its businesses, including those containing the term “Moody’s”, are of material importance to the Company.\nThe Company, primarily through MA and its subsidiaries, licenses certain of its databases, software applications, credit risk models, research and other publications and services that contain intellectual property to its customers. In addition, the Company licenses certain databases, software applications, assessments, research and other publications and services relating to ESG and climate risks that contain intellectual property to its customers. These licenses are provided pursuant to standard agreements containing customary restrictions and intellectual property protections.\nIn addition, Moody’s licenses from third parties certain technology, data and other intellectual property rights. Specifically, Moody’s obtains licenses from third parties to use financial information (such as market and index data, financial statement data, research data, default data, and security identifiers) as well as software development tools and libraries. In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries obtain from third party information providers certain financial, credit risk, compliance, management, ownership, news and/or other data worldwide, which are distributed through certain of Moody's information products. The Company obtains such technology and intellectual property rights from generally available commercial sources. The Company also utilizes generally available open source software and libraries for internal use and subject to appropriately permissive open source licenses, to carry out routine functions in certain of the Company’s software products. Most of such technology and intellectual property is available from a variety of sources. Although certain financial information (particularly security identifiers, certain pricing or index data, and certain company financial data in selected geographic markets) is available from a limited number of sources, Moody’s does not believe it is dependent on any one data source for a material aspect of its business.\nThe names of Moody’s products and services referred to herein are trademarks, service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to Moody’s or one or more of its affiliates. The Company owns patents (including granted, allowed and pending patents). None of the Company's intellectual property is subject to a specific expiration date, except to the extent that the patents and the copyright in items that the Company creates (such as credit reports, research, software, and other written opinions) expire pursuant to relevant law.\n20\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nThe Company considers its intellectual property to be proprietary, and Moody’s relies on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, non-disclosure and other contractual and technological safeguards for protection. Moody’s also pursues instances of third-party infringement of its intellectual property in order to protect the Company’s rights.\nAvailable Information\nMoody’s investor relations internet website is https://ir.moodys.com/. Under the “SEC Filings” tab at this website, the Company makes available free of charge its annual reports on Form 10-K, proxy and other information statements, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy and other information statements that the Company files electronically with the SEC.

    "text": "Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in the Company’s securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the “forward-looking” statements discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and elsewhere. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThe events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results (including components of the Company’s financial results such as sales and profits), cash flows and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that Moody’s faces. The Company could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not consider to present significant risks. In addition to the effects of general economic conditions, including inflation and related monetary policy actions in response to inflation, and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below.\nA. Legal and Regulatory Risks\nMoody’s Faces Risks Related to U.S. Laws and Regulations Affecting the Credit Rating Industry and Moody’s Customers.\nMoody’s operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S., including the Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. Additionally, changes in Congress may increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new or existing legislation or directives by government authorities. See “Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information. The current laws and regulations:\n–\nseek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among CRAs and in the credit rating business;\n–\nmay result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings;\n–\nrestrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;\n–\nincrease regulatory oversight of the credit markets and CRA operations;\n–\nprovide the SEC with direct jurisdiction over CRAs that seek NRSRO status, and grant authority to the SEC to inspect the operations of CRAs; and\n–\nprovide for enhanced oversight standards and specialized pleading standards, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs.\nIf these laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking or court rulings, reduce demand for credit ratings or increase costs, Moody’s may be unable to pass such costs through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions can result in significant expenses. Legal proceedings that are increasingly lengthy can result in uncertainty over and exposure to liability.\nIt is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on Moody’s business and its customers’ businesses. For example, new laws and regulations may affect MIS’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which MIS’s credit ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for MIS’s credit ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for CRAs. Further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect Moody’s stock price. Although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to CRAs and credit markets generally, they may affect Moody’s in a disproportionate manner. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and can have a material adverse effect on Moody’s operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.\nIn addition, MA derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight. U.S. banking regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as many state agencies, have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with third-party relationships, which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity, by contract or otherwise, and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with third-party service providers, and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their third-party relationships. In light of this, MA’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought to and may further revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with MA. This can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers, adversely affect MA’s relationship with such customers, increase the costs of doing business with such customers and/or result in MA assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     23\nMoody’s Faces Risks Related to Financial Reforms Outside the U.S. Affecting the Credit Rating Industry and Moody’s Customers.\nIn addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations governing the industry, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to regulate CRAs and the markets for credit ratings. In particular, the EU has adopted a common regulatory framework for CRAs operating in the EU and continues to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation. Credit ratings emanating from outside the EU are subject to ESMA’s oversight if they are endorsed into the EU. Additionally, other foreign jurisdictions have  taken measures to increase regulation of CRAs and markets for credit ratings. See “Regulation” in Part 1, Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information.\nThe EU and other jurisdictions, as discussed further below, adopt legislation and engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that significantly impacts operations and the markets for the Company's products and services. Future laws and regulations could extend to products and services not currently regulated. These regulations could: (i) affect the need for debt securities to be rated, (ii) expand supervisory remits to include credit ratings issued outside the home jurisdiction and used for regulatory purposes, (iii) increase the level of competition in the market for credit ratings, (iv) establish criteria for credit ratings or limit the entities authorized to provide credit ratings, (v) restrict the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of personal information by CRAs, or (vi) regulate pricing (for example to require  fees that are based on costs and are non-discriminatory) on products and services provided by MA such as those products that incorporate credit ratings and research originated by MIS.  Future regulations could also affect products and services the Company offers in the ESG sector.\nFollowing the Brexit implementation period that ended December 31, 2020 the MIS U.K. registered CRA ceased to be registered with and regulated by ESMA and became subject to regulation by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"). MIS put arrangements in place to endorse its U.K. credit ratings into the EU and its EU credit ratings into the U.K. On December 31, 2020, the U.K. also onshored the EU CRA Regulation, with certain necessary modifications, into U.K. domestic law (the “U.K. CRA Regulation”). The U.K. CRA Regulation contains requirements for the registration, regulation and supervision of CRAs based in the U.K. It also sets out the circumstances in which U.K. financial institutions can use credit ratings for regulatory purposes, as well as specific obligations for issuers, originators and sponsors relating to structured finance instruments. It is unclear if the regulation of CRAs in the EU and the U.K. will differ over time, and divergent regulation between the EU and the U.K. over time or differing interpretations by the FCA and ESMA of CRA regulation could adversely affect MIS’s business through additional operating obligations and resulting increased cost.\nIn February 2022, the FCA published a portfolio letter on its CRA supervision strategy. Among other things, the FCA explained that it takes a holistic approach to supervising CRAs. This means that if a CRA or the group to which it belongs also carries on unregulated activities (for example, ESG ratings), the FCA may assess these unregulated activities as part of its supervision of regulated activities. CRAs need to be able to demonstrate that they have considered, and are actively managing, potential risks from any unregulated activities. The FCA also identified its supervisory priorities for CRAs, which consist of: ratings process and methodologies; governance and oversight; market and perimeter risks; and operational resilience and resourcing. The FCA also identified some other priority areas where it will be carrying out work relevant to CRAs, including a market study on accessing and using wholesale data and ongoing work on ESG ratings.\nBoth of Moody’s segments face risks related to financial reforms outside the U.S. affecting the credit rating industry and Moody’s customers. MIS is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic or other inspections in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions, such as, but not limited to, Hong Kong and China, where it operates through registered subsidiaries.  For example:\n–\nIn the EU and the U.K., applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to credit ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of CRAs hired by issuers of securities for credit ratings of resecuritizations, and restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed. Additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules regarding the organization of CRAs, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest, including requirements that fees be based on costs and non-discriminatory, and special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments.\n–\nIn Hong Kong, applicable rules include liability for the intentional or negligent dissemination of false and misleading information and procedural requirements for the notification of certain matters to regulators. In addition, MIS Hong Kong is subject to a code of conduct applicable to CRAs that imposes procedural and substantive requirements on the preparation and issuance of credit ratings, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including the disclosure of its compensation arrangements with rated entities and special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments. A failure to comply with these procedural and substantive requirements also exposes MIS Hong Kong to the risk of regulatory enforcement action which could result in financial penalties or, in serious cases, affect its ability to conduct credit rating activities in Hong Kong.\n–\nIn China, while MIS is not a licensed CRA, it does issue global credit ratings on Chinese issuers from offices outside of China. In addition, the Company holds a 30% investment in CCXI, a domestic CRA licensed in China. China has laws applicable to domestic CRAs as well as foreign investment in such entities and entities in general (including national security review). Such laws are broadly crafted and the implementation and interpretation of such laws are subject to the broad discretion of Chinese regulators, which could affect the Company's ability to conduct business in China.\n24\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\n–\nIn addition, U.S. economic sanctions have increasingly targeted Chinese persons. In response, China issued a blocking statute that establishes a framework for limiting the effect of foreign sanctions on Chinese persons. Blocking statutes typically create conflicts of law. An entity that is subject to conflicting laws in multiple jurisdictions may need to determine a means to comply with such laws. Such conflicts could eventually affect the ability of entities to adhere to applicable laws.\nWith respect to MA, regulators in Europe and other foreign markets in which MA is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the U.S. relating to financial institutions’ assessment and management of risks associated with third-party relationships. In light of this, MA’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought and may further revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with MA. This can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers, adversely affect MA’s relationship with such customers, increase the costs of doing business with such customers and/or result in MA assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers.\nAlthough Moody’s will monitor developments related to financial reforms outside the U.S. affecting the credit rating industry and Moody’s customers, Moody’s cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations, and the effect that they will have on Moody’s business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant. For example, compliance with the EU, U.K. and other foreign regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on Moody’s operations, profitability or ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services, including in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict. In addition, exposure to increased liability under the EU, U.K. regulations and regulations of other foreign jurisdictions may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact Moody’s results of operations. Financial reforms in the EU, U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Faces Exposure to Litigation and Government Regulatory Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries Related to Rating Opinions and Other Business Practices.\nMoody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to MIS’s ratings actions, as well as other business practices and products within both MIS and MA. When the market value of credit-dependent instruments has declined or defaults have occurred, whether as a result of difficult economic times, turbulent markets or otherwise, the number of investigations and legal proceedings that Moody’s has faced has increased significantly. Parties who invest in securities rated by MIS have pursued claims against MIS or Moody’s for losses they faced in their portfolios. For instance, Moody’s faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation, government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Evolving expectations on ESG disclosures and reporting could also result in new regulatory actions at a corporate and business unit level.  Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time to addressing other business issues, and any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions. Risks relating to legal proceedings are heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. Moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, when Moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by Moody’s increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome.\nAdditionally, as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, Moody’s will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates, which could require Moody’s to record or increase liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. See Note\nto the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the Company currently faces. Due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought, there is a risk that Moody’s will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results that have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Its Compliance and Risk Management Programs.\nMoody’s operates in a number of countries, and as a result the Company is required to comply with and quickly adapt to numerous international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The Company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, antitrust and securities trading laws, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel. Moody’s policies and procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the Company’s risks, including risks resulting from acquisitions, may not be fully effective, and Moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct, fraud or other errors. It is not always possible to deter such errors, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. If Moody’s employees violate its policies or if the Company’s risk management methods are not effective, the Company may be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of the Company’s employees, fines, penalties, regulatory sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets or other penalties, and may suffer harm to its reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     25\nMoody’s Faces Risks Related to Protecting Its Intellectual Property Rights.\nMoody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect the Company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the Company’s ability to compete effectively. Businesses the Company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges the Company faces in protecting its strategic advantage. In addition, the Company’s operating results can be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. The lack of strong legal and technological intellectual property protections in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may increase our vulnerability and may pose risks to our business. From time to time, laws are passed that require publication of certain information, in some cases at no cost, that the Company considers to be its intellectual property and that it currently sells or licenses for a fee, which could result in lost revenue.\nUnauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the Company regards as proprietary. It is also possible that Moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that Moody’s offers, and attempt to require Moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing, or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services. Even if Moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. The Company’s ability to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft, misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient and/or changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets. These risks, and the cost, time and resources needed to address them, may increase as the Company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the United States.\nMoody’s Faces Risks Related to Tax Matters, Including Changes in Tax Rates or Tax Rules.\nAs a global company, Moody’s is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is determined based on the taxable income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors, including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where Moody’s faces higher tax rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which Moody’s is not able to realize the related tax benefit, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, policies and administrative practices, or changes to their interpretation or enforcement, including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting and the global minimum tax rate initiatives being led by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, and the European Union’s state aid rulings, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries.\nIn addition, Moody’s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. Moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits; however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the Company. Although the Company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its income tax provisions, accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nB. Risks Related to our Business\nThe Company is Exposed to Legal, Economic, Operational and Regulatory Risks of Operating in Multiple Jurisdictions.\nMoody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources. Changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the Company operates have an impact on the Company’s business. For example, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone or elsewhere, including, but not limited to, in Latin America or China, affects the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas. In addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section, operations abroad expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:\n–\neconomic and geopolitical market conditions, including the effect of these conditions on customers and customer retention;\n–\nexposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and USD;\n–\nrestrictions on the ability to convert local currency into USD and the costs, including the tax impact, of repatriating cash held by entities outside the U.S.;\n–\nU.S. laws affecting overseas operations, including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions, such as those related to the U.S.’s relationship with China and embargoes and sanctions laws with respect to Russia, including the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and Venezuela;\n–\ndiffering and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards;\n26\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\n–\ncurrent and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by issuers of securities;\n–\nuncertain and evolving laws and regulations, including those applicable to the financial services industries, such as the European Union’s implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, MiFID II, in January 2018, and to the protection of intellectual property;\n–\nuncertainty regarding the future relationship between the U.S. and China, which may result in further restrictions or actions by the U.S. government with respect to doing business in China and/or by the Chinese government with respect to business conducted by foreign entities in China;\n–\nthe possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;\n–\ncompetition with CRAs that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;\n–\nuncertainties in obtaining data and creating products and services relevant to particular geographic markets;\n–\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n–\nlonger payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables;\n–\ndiffering accounting principles and standards;\n–\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n–\ndifficulties and delays in translating documentation into foreign languages;\n–\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n–\ncomplexities of compliance with employment laws and new data and cybersecurity rules in numerous jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, Moody’s is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as laws and regulations governing economic and trade sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, and anticorruption including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other similar local laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices the Company has implemented may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination or allegations, even if unfounded, that the Company has violated sanctions, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, and restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody’s Operations are Exposed to Risks from Infrastructure Malfunctions or Failures.\nMoody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which Moody’s is located, including: (i) New York City, the location of Moody’s headquarters, (ii) major cities worldwide in which Moody’s has offices, (iii) locations in Europe that may be affected by the conflict in Russia/Ukraine; and (iv)  locations in China used for certain Moody’s work. This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure (whether or not controlled by the Company), including the Company’s electronic delivery systems, the Company's data center facilities, or the Internet, used by the Company or third parties with or through whom Moody’s conducts business. Many of the Company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the Company’s customers depend on the Company’s ability to receive, store, process, transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks. Some of Moody’s operations require complex processes and the Company’s extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations cannot eliminate such risk completely. To the extent the Company grows  through acquisitions, newly acquired businesses may not have invested in technological infrastructure and disaster recovery to the same extent as Moody's has. As their systems are integrated into Moody's, a vulnerability could be introduced, which could impact platforms across the Company. The Company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of the Company’s telecommunications, data centers, networks and other electronic delivery systems, including its websites and connections to the Internet. The Company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use. Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-breach, interruption or a significant slowdown of operations of the Company’s infrastructure, whether due to human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, weather (including climate change), natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, pandemic (including the COVID-19 pandemic), war or otherwise, may impair the Company’s ability to deliver its products and services.\nMoody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. The Company relies on third-party providers, including, increasingly, cloud-based service providers, to provide certain essential services. While the Company believes that such providers are reliable, the Company has limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of the Company’s third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the Company’s needs and the needs of the Company’s customers, the Company could\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     27\nexperience lower revenues and higher costs. Additionally, although the Company maintains processes to prevent, detect and recover from a disruption, the Company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with Moody’s customers will suffer. The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the Company’s failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to Moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Economics of the Company’s Business is Dependent on the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets. Recent Financial Market Conditions, Including Decreased Asset Levels and Flows into Investment Vehicles, Increases in Interest Rates and Other Volatility Has Had, and May Continue to Have, a Material Adverse Impact on the Volume of Debt Securities Issued.\nMoody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in world financial markets. Furthermore, issuers of debt securities have increasingly elected to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional CRAs, such as MIS. A majority of Moody’s credit-rating-based revenue is transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities, such as market volatility, declining growth, currency devaluations, changes in laws (including tax-related laws) or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which Moody’s provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees Moody’s earns in its ratings business.\nCurrent market, economic and government factors are negatively impacting the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings, which is materially and adversely affecting the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. These factors include increases in interest rates (as well as the related monetary policy by governments in the response to inflation), the withdrawal of COVID-19 economic stimulus, inflationary pressures, increases in mortgage rates, widening credit spreads, regulatory and political developments (including uncertainty in various jurisdictions where Moody's operates), difficult economic conditions, growth in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. Further declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.\nMoody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business, including the 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program, may not be sufficient. Cost reductions, including those associated with this program, may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance, compensation and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, cost-reduction initiatives, including those under-taken to date, could make it difficult for the Company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings. Further volatility in the financial markets, including continued decreases in the volumes of debt securities and increases in interest rates, may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition, which the Company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions.\nThe Company Faces Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers.\nThere is price competition in the credit rating, research, and credit risk management markets, as well as in the market for research, business intelligence and analytical services offered by MA. Moody’s faces competition globally from other CRAs and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research, as well as from in-house research operations. Competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from non-NRSROs that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors. At the same time, a challenging business environment and consolidation among both competitors and customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products and commercial real estate, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the Company’s customer base. Recent weak economic growth has intensified competitive pricing pressures, which may result  in customers’ use of free or lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources or their development of alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk that replace the products currently purchased from Moody’s. While Moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services, it can lose market share when its pricing is not sufficiently competitive. In addition, the Reform Act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. The formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing and competitive pressures. Furthermore, in some of the countries in which Moody’s operates, governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies. Any inability of Moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services will have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.\n28\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nThe Company Is Exposed to Reputation and Credibility Concerns.\nMoody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. To the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or Moody's, relative to its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody’s business will be significantly impacted. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in ratings, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process, including as to the Company’s recent ESG initiatives, and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional, poor representation of our products and services by our partners or agents, manipulation of our products and services by third parties, or unintentional misrepresentations of Moody’s products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications. Operational errors, whether by Moody’s or a Moody’s competitor, could also harm the reputation of the Company or the credit rating industry. Damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition, as well as on the Company’s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition.\nThe Introduction of Competing Products, Technologies or Services by Other Companies Can Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.\nThe markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, business intelligence and analytical services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer and investor demands, and evolving regulatory requirements, industry standards and market preferences. The ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products, technologies and services that anticipate customers’ and investors’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends in a timely and cost-effective manner is a key factor in maintaining market share. Moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s, or may position, price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by Moody’s. Moody’s also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers, some of whom are also suppliers to Moody’s; these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with Moody’s, cease doing business with Moody’s or change the terms under which they do business with Moody’s in a way that could negatively impact our business. In addition, customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing risk, including credit and climate risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody’s products and services and its growth prospects. Further, the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for Moody’s products and services. Moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by Moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors. Any inability of Moody’s to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\nMoody’s Is Exposed to Risks Related to Loss of Skilled Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures.\nMoody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced professionals, including financial analysts. Competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries. Rising expenses including wage inflation, and global labor shortages could adversely affect Moody’s ability to attract and retain high-quality employees. As greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, Moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. We could also fail to effectively respond to evolving perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire, including in response to changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, with respect to flexible working or other matters. There is a risk that even when the Company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be harmed. Further, employee expectations in areas such as environmental, social matters and corporate governance have been rapidly evolving and increasing. A failure to adequately meet employee expectations may result in an inability to attract and retain talented employees.\nMoody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of Robert Fauber, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior officers and key employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and Moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     29\nMoody’s Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Strategic Transactions or Investments May Not Produce Anticipated Results Exposing the Company to Future Significant Impairment Charges Relating to Its Goodwill, Intangible Assets or Property and Equipment.\nMoody’s regularly evaluates and enters into acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions and investments to strengthen its business and grow the Company. For example, Moody’s acquired Bureau van Dijk in 2017, Reis in 2018, Regulatory DataCorp (RDC) in 2020, and RMS in 2021. Such transactions and investments present significant challenges and risks. The Company faces intense competition for acquisition targets, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect Moody’s ability to complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, the Company makes significant investments in technology, including software for internal use, which can be expensive, time-intensive and complex to develop and implement.\nThe anticipated growth, synergies and other strategic objectives of completed transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Any strategic transaction involves a number of risks, including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations, technologies and new employees; the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the Company prior to closing a transaction; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities; failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; future developments that impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets; diversion of management’s focus from other business operations; failure to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; disputes or litigation arising out of acquisitions or dispositions; challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business; coordination of product, sales, marketing and program and systems management functions; integration of employees from the acquired business into Moody’s organization; integration of the acquired business’s accounting, information technology, human resources, legal and other administrative systems with Moody’s; risks that acquired systems expose us to cybersecurity risks; and for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction or investment may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions and investments to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2022, Moody’s had $5,839 million of goodwill and $2,210 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet. Approximately 94% of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the MA business, including those related to Bureau van Dijk and RMS, and are allocated to the two reporting units within MA. The remaining 6% of goodwill and intangible assets reside in MIS and primarily relate to ICRA. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Global COVID-19 Pandemic May Have a Material Adverse Impact on the Company’s Operations and Financial Performance.\nThe Company’s operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted by future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The future impact of the pandemic on the Company’s operations and financial performance as well as the performance of our customers, depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals’ actions (including restrictions on travel and workforce pressures); actions taken in response to global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the potential emergence of new COVID-19 variants; uncertainty presented by approved vaccines, corresponding rollout and unanticipated consequences of such vaccines; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides. These future impacts may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks, such as those surrounding cybersecurity due to increased remote work, described in our risk factors in this Form 10-K.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by climate change\n.\nAs a global company, our employees and offices are subject to risks related to the impact of climate change. We have offices in locations that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and extreme weather.  In addition, continued reliable energy sources are critical for business continuity globally and those sources too can be impacted by extreme weather. The frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure has the potential to disrupt the Company’s ongoing operations, as well as the  operations of our vendors and customers, and may result in losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\nC.\nTechnology Risks\nThe Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Protection of Confidential Information.\nThe Company’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the Company’s computer systems and networks, and in those of its third party vendors. Unauthorized disclosure of\n30\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nthis information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us. The risks the Company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target the Company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to its ratings of sovereign debt. Breaches of Moody’s or Moody’s vendors’ technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks some of which may be carried out by state-sponsored actors, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, social media impersonation, ransomware, or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s or such vendors’ web sites or systems, applications, data processing, or disruption of other business operations, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about Moody’s business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable information (PII), the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Measures that Moody’s takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective. Additionally, the Company may be exposed to additional threats as the Company migrates its data from legacy systems to cloud-based solutions, and increased dependence on third parties to store cloud-based data subjects the Company to further cyber risks. Further, many of our employees work remotely, which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures and may expose the Company to additional cyber risks.\nThe Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, disaster plans, and technical defenses. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex, and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite the Company’s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from, and has in the past experienced, security threats and system disruptions. Although past incidents have not had a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Because the methods used for these systems cyberattacks are rapidly changing, the Company, despite significant focus and investment, may be unable to anticipate/deploy sufficient protections against such incidents. Further, the extent of a particular security incident and the steps needed to investigate may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident, including the extent of the harm and how best to remediate it, is known. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity compliance requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Cybersecurity incidents, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, could cause reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company’s customers’ information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. In addition, disclosure or media reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company’s systems or those of the Company’s third parties, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could lead to reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, or increased regulatory actions oversight and scrutiny.\nAny of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Protection of Personal  Information\nTo conduct its operations, the Company regularly moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security such as the Federal Trade Commission Act in the United States, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation in the U.K., the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law in China and various other international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to Moody’s is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union privacy law and added a broad array of requirements for processing personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. Additionally, other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. Further, laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"), require among other things, covered companies to provide disclosures to consumers, and affords consumers the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) became effective on January 1, 2023. The effects of non-compliance with the CCPA, CPRA and other similar data privacy laws in other jurisdictions are significant, and may require the Company to modify its data processing practices and policies and to incur additional costs and expenses. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements have required changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, requiring significant management time and attention, and subjecting the Company to negative publicity, as well as remedies that may harm its business, including fines, modified demands or orders, the cessation of existing business practices, and exposure to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     31\nThe Company Is Dependent on the Use of Third-Party Software, Data, Hosted Solutions, Data Centers, Cloud and Network Infrastructure (Together, “Third Party Technology”), and Any Reduction in Third-Party Product Quality or Service Offerings, Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations.\nMoody’s relies on Third Party Technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations. The Company depends on the ability of Third Party Technology providers to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, provide data necessary to develop and maintain its products and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. The Third Party Technology Moody’s uses can become obsolete or restrictive, incompatible with future versions of the Company’s products, fail to be comprehensive or accurate, unavailable or fail to operate effectively, and Moody’s business could be adversely affected when the Company is unable to timely or effectively replace such Third Party Technology.\nThe Company also monitors its use of Third Party Technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements. Despite the Company’s efforts, the Company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit Moody’s use in the future, resulting in increased Third Party Technology acquisition costs and loss of rights. In addition, the Company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for Third Party Technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to Third Party Technology are substantial. In the ordinary course, our third-parties, including our vendors, are subject to various forms of cyber attacks. To date, such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. Some of these third-party suppliers are also Moody’s competitors, increasing the risks noted above. When any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations."

    "text": "This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page\nand Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing on page\nfor a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.\nThe Company\nMoody’s is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations and investors to make better decisions. Moody’s reports in two segments: MIS and MA.\nMIS publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities.\nMA is a global provider of: i) data and information; ii) research and insights; and iii) decision solutions, which help companies make better and faster decisions. MA leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks such as credit, market, financial crime, supply chain, catastrophe and climate to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities.\nCurrent Matters Impacting Moody's Business\nCurrent Macroeconomic Uncertainties/Market Volatility\nThe Company is monitoring current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that have contributed to declines in rated issuance volumes in 2022. A substantial portion of MIS’s revenue is impacted by the level of issuance activity in the fixed income capital markets, both in the U.S. and internationally. While market volatility in 2022 has resulted in declines in rated issuance volumes, the Company believes that these declines are predominantly cyclical in nature. However, due to various uncertainties, Moody's is unable to predict the severity and duration of current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and their potential impact on future ratings issuance volumes. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further disclosure relating to these risks.\nRussia/Ukraine Conflict\nThe Company is closely monitoring the impact of the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict on all aspects of its business. In response to the conflict, the Company is no longer conducting commercial operations in Russia for both MIS and MA and is complying with all applicable regulatory restrictions set forth by the jurisdictions in which Moody's operates. Furthermore, the Company also has withdrawn MIS credit ratings on Russian entities.\nWhile Moody's Russian operations and net assets are not material, broader global market volatility, which partially relates to uncertainties surrounding the conflict, has contributed to an adverse impact on rated issuance volumes in 2022. This impact to rated issuance volumes is more fully discussed in the \"Results of Operations\" section of this MD&A. The Company is unable to predict either the near-term or longer-term impact that the conflict may have on its financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties regarding the severity and duration of the conflict and its broader potential macroeconomic impact.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business. The Company continues to monitor regional developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic to inform decisions regarding its offices and its business travel policies. As of the date of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, the Company has reopened all of its offices for employees to access.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on the Company's reported results to date and is currently not expected to have a material adverse impact on its financial outlook. Refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further disclosure relating to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nMoody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its critical accounting estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     35\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nAt July 31st of each year, Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., MIS and MA), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment).\nThe Company has four reporting units: two within the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations) and two reporting units within MA consisting of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and CRE solutions.\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired, and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions, realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years.\nThe Company last performed quantitative assessments on all reporting units at July 31, 2021, pursuant to a change in reporting unit structure in the MA reportable segment. The quantitative assessments performed at July 31, 2021 resulted in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values for all reporting units.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are more fully described below. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.\nOther assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.\nAnnual goodwill impairment assessment performed at July 31, 2022\nAt July 31, 2022, the Company performed qualitative assessments for each of the four reporting units. These qualitative assessments resulted in the Company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.\nMethodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units:\nThe following is a discussion regarding the Company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding ICRA, at July 31, 2021 (the date of the last quantitative assessment). As ICRA is a publicly traded company in India, the Company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.\nThe fair value of each reporting unit, excluding ICRA, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.\nThe sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and WACC assumptions are described below. These key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology require significant management judgment:\n–\nFuture cash flow assumptions\n- The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. These projections are consistent with the Company’s operating budget and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on new customer acquisition and new products. Beyond five years, a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. For each reporting unit analyzed, a 10% reduction in the revenue growth rates used would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.\n–\nWACC\n- The WACC is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate and an equity risk factor, which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the\n36\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nweighted average cost associated with all of the Company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 8.0% to 8.5% as of July 31, 2021. Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units as of July 31, 2021 for each reporting unit. For all reporting units, an increase in the WACC of one percentage point would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.\nLong-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, which consist primarily of amortizable intangible assets, operating lease ROU assets and property and equipment, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nUnder the first step of the recoverability assessment, Moody's compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value, no further assessment is required. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, Moody's proceeds with step two of the assessment. Under step two of this assessment, Moody's is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In performing this assessment, Moody's must include assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value, including the estimated future cash flows and discount rate. Moody's must apply judgment in developing estimated future cash flows and in the determination of market participant assumptions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.\nThe Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for UTPs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.\nFor UTPs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTPs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\nRevenue Recognition and Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nRevenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe discussion below outlines areas of the Company’s revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates. Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the Company’s accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer.\nAllocating consideration to performance obligations:\nManagement judgment is required in the determination of the SSP, which is utilized to allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation at contract inception when the contract includes multiple distinct performance obligations.\nIn the MIS segment, the SSP for both ratings and monitoring services is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately.\nIn the MA segment, for performance obligations where an observable price exists, such as PCS, the observable price is utilized. If an observable price does not currently exist, the Company will utilize management’s best estimate of SSP for that good or service using estimation methods that maximize the use of observable data points.\nThe SSP in both segments is usually apportioned along the lines of class of customer, nature of product/services, and other attributes related to those products and services. Once SSP is determined for each performance obligation, the transaction price, including any discount, is allocated based on the relative SSP of the separate performance obligations.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     37\nCosts to Obtain a Contract with a Customer:\nCosts incurred to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract, would not have been incurred otherwise and the Company expects to recover those costs. These costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of products or services to the customer for which the asset relates. Depending on the line of business to which the contract relates, this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided, inclusive of anticipated contract renewals.\nContingencies\nAccounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.\nFor claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly.\nMoody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. However, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.\nPension and Other Retirement Benefits\nThe expenses, assets and liabilities that Moody’s reports for its Retirement Plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These significant assumptions include the following:\n–\nfuture compensation increases based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook;\n–\nlong-term expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments); and\n–\ndiscount rates based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.\nThe discount rates used to measure the present value of the Company’s benefit obligation for its Retirement Plans as of December 31, 2022 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the FTSE pension discount curve. The cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.\nMoody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s Retirement Plans.\nWhen actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. Excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets, the Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For Moody’s Retirement Plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2022 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $68 million, and Moody’s expects the net periodic expense related to the amortization of net actuarial (losses)/gains will be immaterial in 2023.\n38\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nFor Moody’s funded U.S. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under ASC Topic 715, the Company amortizes the impact of asset returns over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has an unrecognized loss of $106 million, of which $19 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2023 expense.\nThe table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2023 income before provision for income taxes. These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2023 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moody’s Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.\n(1)\nWeighted average discount rates of 4.93% and 4.90% for pension plans and Other Retirement Plans, respectively.\nBased on current projections, the Company estimates that expenses related to Retirement Plans will be immaterial in 2023.\nInvestments in Non-consolidated Affiliates\nEquity method investments are reviewed for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. These investments are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary.\nFor equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which the Company does not have significant influence, Moody's generally elects to measure these investments at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place.\nThe Company performs an assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment for its investments in non-consolidated affiliates. If there are indicators of impairment, the Company estimates the investment’s fair value and records an impairment if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value.\nIn situations where estimation of fair value is required for investments in non-consolidated affiliates, the Company considers various factors, including: recent observable investee equity transactions, comparable public company/precedent transaction multiples and discounted cash flow models. The estimation of fair value for these investments may involve significant judgment.\nOther Estimates\nIn addition to the critical accounting estimates described above, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moody’s.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company is organized into two reportable segments at December 31, 2022: MIS and MA, which are more fully described in the section entitled “The Company” above and in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     39\nResults of Operations\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 financial results and year-to-year comparisons between these years. Discussions related to the year ended December 31, 2020 financial results and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2021\n.\nImpact of acquisitions/divestitures on comparative results\nMoody’s completed the following acquisitions, which impact the Company's year-over-year comparative results:\n–\nCortera on March 19, 2021;\n–\nRMS on September 15, 2021;\n–\nRealXData on September 17, 2021;\n–\nPassFort on November 30, 2021; and\n–\nkompany on February 28, 2022.\nRefer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" of this MD&A for the definitions of how the Company determines certain organic growth measures used in this MD&A that exclude the impact of acquisition activity.\nThe following footnotes are applicable throughout the discussion of the Company's results of operations:\n(1)\nRefer to the section entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" of this MD&A for the definition and methodology that the Company utilizes to calculate this metric.\n(2)\nRefer to the section entitled \"Key Performance Metrics\" of this MD&A for the definition and methodology that the Company utilizes to calculate this metric.\n40\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nYear ended December 31, 2022 compared with year ended December 31, 2021\nExecutive Summary\nThe following table provides an executive summary of key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2022. Following this executive summary is a more detailed discussion of the Company’s operating results as well as a discussion of the operating results of the Company’s reportable segments.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     41\nMoody’s Corporation\nGLOBAL REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nThe decrease in global revenue reflected declines in MIS in all regions, partially offset by growth in MA in all regions. Refer to the section entitled “Segment Results” of this MD&A for a more fulsome discussion of the Company’s segment revenue.\n42\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nChanges in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted global revenue by three percent.\nOrganic constant currency revenue\n(1)\nfor MCO decreased 13%.\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense is driven by higher amortization of intangible assets reflecting recent M&A activity (most notably RMS) coupled with amortization of internally developed software, which is primarily related to the development of MA SaaS solutions.\nThe restructuring charge in 2022 relates to the Company's 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program as more fully discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOverall, margin declines primarily resulted from the aforementioned decrease in MIS revenue.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     43\nThe gain in 2022 relates to the early redemption of a portion of the 2.55% 2020 Senior Notes, Due 2060, as more fully discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe primary drivers for the increase in the ETR include:\n— tax benefits realized upon resolution of uncertain tax positions during 2021 that did not recur to the same extent in 2022; and\n— a non-deductible loss in 2022 associated with the Company no longer conducting commercial operations in Russia.\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS declined mainly due to lower operating income and Adjusted Operating Income, respectively. Refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of this MD&A for items excluded in the derivation of Adjusted Diluted EPS.\n44\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nSegment Results\nMoody’s Investors Service\nThe table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary:\nThe following chart presents changes in rated issuance volumes compared to 2021. To the extent that changes in rated issuance volumes had a material impact to MIS's revenue compared to the prior year, those impacts are discussed below.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     45\nMOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nThe decrease in global MIS revenue primarily relates to a 31% decrease in rated issuance volumes, which resulted in transaction revenue declining $1,128 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in rated issuance volumes compared to 2021 reflected muted credit market activity across all sectors given ongoing market volatility, central bank actions, high levels of balance sheet cash, as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns.\nChanges in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted MIS revenue by two percentage points.\nCFG REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\n46\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nGlobal CFG revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was comprised as follows\n:\n(1)\nOther includes: recurring monitoring fees of a rated debt obligation and/or entities that issue such obligations as well as fees from programs such as commercial paper, medium term notes and ICRA corporate finance revenue.\nThe decrease in CFG revenue of 39% reflected declines both in the U.S. (40%) and internationally (38%), which resulted in an $828 million decrease in transaction revenue.\nThe most notable drivers of the decrease compared to 2021 reflected declines in leveraged finance and investment-grade issuance activity resulting from muted credit market activity given ongoing market volatility, central bank actions, high levels of balance sheet cash, as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns compared to a strong prior year period.\nSFG REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nGlobal SFG revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was comprised as follows:\nThe decrease in SFG revenue of 18% reflected declines both in the U.S. (15%) and internationally (21%). Transaction revenue decreased $100 million.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     47\nThe most notable driver of the decline compared to 2021 was a decrease in CLO refinancing activity in the U.S. and EMEA resulting from the widening of credit spreads for this asset class.\nChanges in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted SFG revenue by three percentage points.\nFIG REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nGlobal FIG revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was comprised as follows:\nThe decrease in FIG revenue of 18% reflected declines both in the U.S. (23%) and internationally (14%) which resulted in a $109 million decrease in transaction revenue compared to the prior year.\nThe most notable drivers of the decline reflected lower revenue from banking and insurance issuers primarily due to:\n–\nan unfavorable product mix; and\n–\na decline in opportunistic issuance, as banks, insurers and asset management issuers were well capitalized following financing activity in the prior year period ahead of anticipated interest rate increases.\nChanges in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted FIG revenue by two percentage points.\n48\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nPPIF REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nGlobal PPIF revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was comprised as follows:\nTransaction revenue decreased $91 million compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe 17% decrease in PPIF revenue reflected declines both in the U.S. (13%) and internationally (24%) The decrease in revenue was mainly due to:\n–\ndeclines in U.S. public finance revenue resulting from market volatility, which increased funding costs, coupled with issuers in this sector being currently well capitalized; and\n–\ndeclines in sovereign, project finance and infrastructure finance rated issuance volumes in EMEA resulting from market volatility and rising funding costs.\nChanges in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted PPIF revenue by two percentage points.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     49\nThe decrease in operating and SG&A expense reflects a $150 million decrease in compensation expense partially offset by a $31 million increase in non-compensation expenses. The most notable drivers of these changes are as follows:\nFavorable changes in FX translation rates reduced compensation and non-compensation costs by approximately $40 million and approximately $10 million, respectively.\nThe MIS Adjusted Operating Margin decline primarily reflected the aforementioned 29% decrease in revenue.\nThe restructuring charge in 2022 relates to the Company's 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program as more fully discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nMoody’s Analytics\nThe table below provides a summary of revenue and operating results, followed by further insight and commentary:\n50\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nThe 15% increase in global MA revenue reflects strong growth both in the U.S. (19%) and internationally (12%) in all LOBs and includes revenue from the acquisitions of RMS, PassFort and kompany. Changes in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted MA revenue by five percentage points.\nOrganic constant currency revenue\n(1)\ngrowth was 10%.\nARR\n(2)\nincreased 10% reflecting strong growth across all LOBs.\nDECISION SOLUTIONS REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nGlobal DS revenue grew 31% compared to 2021 reflecting growth in the U.S. (34%) and internationally (29%). The most notable drivers of the growth include:\n–\ninorganic revenue growth from the acquisitions of RMS, PassFort and kompany;\n–\ncontinued demand for KYC and anti-money laundering compliance solutions;\n–\ngrowth in subscription-based revenue for pension and actuarial modeling tools in support of certain international accounting standards relating to insurance contracts; and\n–\ngrowth in subscription-based banking solutions driven by continued product development with a strategic emphasis on cloud-based SaaS solutions.\nChanges in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted DS revenue by four percentage points.\nOrganic constant currency revenue\n(1)\ngrew 12%.\nARR\n(2)\ngrew 11% primarily reflecting increased demand for KYC and banking products.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     51\nRESEARCH AND INSIGHTS REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nGlobal R&I revenue increased 5% compared to 2021, mainly driven by growth in recurring revenue of 6%, primarily due to continued strong retention and demand for credit research, analytics and models.\nChanges in foreign currency translation rates unfavorably impacted R&I revenue by three percentage points.\nConstant currency revenue\n(1)\ngrowth for R&I was 8%.\nARR\n(2)\ngrew 9%, primarily reflecting the aforementioned strong retention and demand for credit research, analytics and models.\nDATA AND INFORMATION REVENUE\n2022\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2021\n_________________________________________________\n_________\n______________________________________________\nGlobal D&I revenue increased 2% compared to 2021, with the main drivers of the growth reflecting:\n–\ncontinued strong retention and new sales for ratings data feeds coupled with pricing increases; and\n–\nincreased demand for company data.\nChanges in foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted D&I revenue by seven percentage points.\nOrganic constant currency revenue\n(1)\ngrowth for D&I was 9%.\nARR\n(2)\ngrew 9% reflecting increasing demand for company data and ratings data feeds products.\n52\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nThe increase in operating and SG&A expenses compared to 2021 is primarily due to growth in both compensation and non-compensation costs of $125 million and $17 million, respectively, with the most notable drivers of the increase reflecting:\nFavorable changes in FX translation rates reduced compensation and non-compensation costs by approximately $45 million and approximately $20 million, respectively.\nThe Adjusted Operating Margin increase for MA is primarily due to the 15% increase in global MA revenue partially offset by operational and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions.\nThe increase in depreciation and amortization expense is driven by higher amortization of intangible assets reflecting recent M&A activity (most notably RMS) and amortization of internally developed software relating to the development of SaaS-based solutions.\nThe restructuring charge in 2022 relates to the Company's 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program as more fully discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nMarket Risk\nForeign exchange risk:\nMoody’s maintains a presence in more than 40 countries. In 2022, approximately 40% of the Company’s revenue and approximately 38% of the Company's expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 51% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S., making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. The effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies to the U.S. dollar are charged or credited to OCI.\nThe effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency. The following table shows the impact to the fair value of\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     53\nthe forward contracts if currencies being purchased were to weaken by 10%:\n(1)\nRefer to Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail on the forward contracts.\nThe change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by FX revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency.\nDerivatives and non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges:\nThe Company designates derivative instruments and foreign currency-denominated debt as hedges of foreign currency risk of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries (net investment hedges) under ASC Topic 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n.\nCross-currency swaps\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries, for which the notional values and corresponding interest rates are disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIf the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $310 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the cross-currency swaps recognized in OCI, which would be offset by favorable currency translation gains on the Company’s euro net investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nEuro-denominated debt\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has designated €500 million of the 2015 Senior Notes and €750 million of the 2019 Senior Notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate FX exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. If the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $133 million unfavorable adjustment to OCI related to these net investment hedges. This adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the Company’s euro net investment in subsidiaries.\nInterest rate and credit risk:\nInterest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge:\nThe Company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to a desired risk profile. Moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed-rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month and 6-month LIBOR as well as SOFR. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. A hypothetical change of 100 BPS in the LIBOR/SOFR-based swap rate would result in an approximate $110 million change to the fair value of the swaps, which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item.\nAdditional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nMoody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.\n54\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nMoody's remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by both investing in the Company's employees and growing the business through targeted organic initiatives and inorganic acquisitions aligned with strategic priorities. Additional excess capital is returned to the Company’s shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nCash Flow\nThe Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases from operating and financing cash flows.\nThe following is a summary of the changes in the Company’s cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes:\n(1)\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital expenditures. Refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of this MD&A for further information on this financial measure.\nNet cash provided by operating activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities decreased $531 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting:\n–\na decrease in operating income of $961 million (see section entitled “Results of Operations” of this MD&A for further discussion);\n–\nhigher incentive compensation payouts in 2022 of approximately $130 million resulting from the Company's strong performance during 2021; and\n–\nvarious changes in working capital;\npartially offset by:\n–\nfavorable impact from changes in accounts receivable of $291 million in 2022 resulting from collections in 2022 relating to strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2021; and\n–\nlower cash paid for income taxes of $444 million (refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further analysis of the Company's income taxes).\nNet cash used in investing activities\nThe $2,357 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities compared to 2021 primarily reflects:\n–\nhigher cash paid of $2,082 million in the prior year for acquisitions, primarily reflecting the acquisition of RMS (refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Company's M&A activity);\n–\n$250 million of cash paid in the prior year for a minority investment in BitSight (refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the Company's investments in non-consolidated affiliates); and\n–\nhigher net cash receipts of $231 million in 2022 relating to the settlement of net investment hedges;\npartially offset by:\n–\nan increase in cash paid for capital additions of $144 million reflecting product development and investments relating to strategic initiatives to support business growth and to enhance technology infrastructure to enable automation, innovation and efficiency.\nNet cash used in financing activities\nThe $1,086 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributed to:\n–\nhigher net issuance (issuance, less repayment) of $810 million in long-term debt in 2021;\n–\nhigher cash paid for treasury share repurchases in 2022 of $233 million, which includes payment for shares made under an ASR agreement executed in the first quarter of 2022; and\n–\nhigher dividend payments of $52 million in 2022.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     55\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments\nThe Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2022 included approximately $1.4 billion located outside of the U.S. Approximately 42% of the Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in euros and British pounds. The Company manages both its U.S. and non-U.S. cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to U.S. tax. The Company continues to evaluate which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the U.S. The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, the Company has commenced repatriating a portion of its non-U.S. cash in these subsidiaries and will continue to repatriate certain of its offshore cash in a manner that addresses compliance with local statutory requirements, sufficient offshore working capital and any other factors that may be relevant in certain jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the Tax Act, which generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the U.S., cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes or withholding or similar taxes.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe Company's material cash requirements consist of the following contractual and other obligations:\nFinancing Arrangements\nIndebtedness\nAt December 31, 2022, Moody’s had $7.4 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $1 billion of additional capacity available under the Company’s CP program, which is backstopped by the $1.25 billion 2021 Facility.\nThe repayment schedule for the Company’s borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nFuture interest payments and fees associated with the Company's debt and credit facility are expected to be $4.8 billion, of which approximately $316 million is expected to be paid over the next twelve months. For additional information on the Company's outstanding debt, CP program and 2021 Facility, refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations generally include multi-year agreements with vendors to purchase goods or services and mainly include data center/cloud hosting fees and fees for information technology licensing and maintenance. As of December 31, 2022, these purchase obligations totaled $218 million, of which $138 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating lease obligations of $474 million at December 31, 2022, primarily related to real estate leases, of which approximately $119 million in payments are expected over the next twelve months. For more information on the Company's operating leases, refer to Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.\nPension and Other Retirement Plan Obligations\nThe Company does not anticipate making significant contributions to its funded pension plan in the next twelve months. This plan is overfunded at December 31, 2022, and accordingly holds sufficient investments to fund future benefit obligations. Payments for the Company's unfunded plans are not expected to be material in either the short or long-term. For further information on the Company's pension and other retirement plan obligations, refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\n56\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nDividends and share repurchases\nOn January 30, 2023, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share for Moody’s common stock, payable March 17, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 24, 2023. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board.\nOn February 9, 2021, the Board approved $1 billion in share repurchase authority, and on February 7, 2022, the Board approved an additional $750 million of share repurchase authority. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $848 million of remaining authority. There is no established expiration date for the remaining authorizations.\nRestructuring\nAs more fully discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is currently in the process of executing the 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program. This program relates to the Company's post-COVID-19 geolocation strategy and includes the rationalization and exit of certain real estate leases and a reduction in staff, including the relocation of certain job functions from their current locations. Future cash outlays associated with this program are expected to be approximately $60 million to $80 million, which are expected to be paid through 2024.\nSources of Funding to Satisfy Material Cash Requirements\nThe Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2023. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources as described above.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to its reported results, Moody’s has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as “Non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such adjusted financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These adjusted measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore, these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are brief descriptions of the Company’s adjusted financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the adjusted measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:\nThe Company presents Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody's operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income excludes the impact of: i) depreciation and amortization; and ii) restructuring charges/adjustments. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different useful lives and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Restructuring charges/adjustments are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies.\nManagement believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company’s operating results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     57\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS attributable to Moody’s common shareholders:\nThe Company presents Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody's operating performance. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude the impact of: i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; iii) a gain on the extinguishment of debt; iv) FX translation losses reclassified to earnings resulting from the Company no longer conducting commercial operations in Russia; and v) a non-cash gain relating to the Company’s minority investment in BitSight.\nThe Company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different estimated useful lives and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. These intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisition accounting and contribute to revenue generation. The amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. Restructuring charges/adjustments, the gain on extinguishment of debt, FX translation losses reclassified to earnings resulting from the Company no longer conducting commercial operations in Russia, and the non-cash gain relating to the Company's minority interest in BitSight are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these items may vary widely across periods and companies.\nThe Company excludes the aforementioned items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted EPS from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.\n58\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nBelow is a reconciliation of this measure to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP amount:\nNote: the tax impacts in the table above were calculated using tax rates in effect in the jurisdiction for which the item relates.\nFree Cash Flow:\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of Moody’s cash flow. Below is a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     59\nOrganic Constant Currency Revenue Growth (Decline)/Constant Currency Revenue Growth (Decline):\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2022, the Company began presenting organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) and constant currency revenue growth (decline) as its non-GAAP measure of revenue growth (decline). Previously, the Company presented organic revenue growth (decline), which excluded only the impact of certain acquisition activity. Management deems this revised measure to be useful in providing additional perspective in assessing the Company's revenue growth (decline) excluding both the inorganic revenue impacts from certain acquisition activity and the impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company calculates the dollar impact of foreign exchange as the difference between the translation of its current period non-USD functional currency results using comparative prior period weighted average foreign exchange translation rates and current year reported results.\nBelow is a reconciliation of the Company's reported revenue and growth (decline) rates to its organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) and constant currency revenue growth (decline) measures:\n60\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nKey Performance Metrics:\nThe Company presents Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) on a constant currency organic basis for its MA business as a supplemental performance metric to provide additional insight on the estimated value of MA's recurring revenue contracts at a given point in time. The Company uses ARR to manage and monitor performance of its MA operating segment and believes that this metric is a key indicator of the trajectory of MA's recurring revenue base.\nThe Company calculates ARR by taking the total recurring contract value for each active renewable contract as of the reporting date, divided by the number of days in the contract and multiplied by 365 days to create an annualized value. The Company defines renewable contracts as subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and renewable services. ARR excludes transaction sales including training, one-time services and perpetual licenses. In order to compare period-over-period ARR excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the Company bases the calculation on currency rates utilized in its current year operating budget and holds these FX rates constant for the duration of all current and prior periods being reported. Additionally, ARR excludes contracts related to acquisitions to provide additional perspective in assessing growth excluding the impacts from certain acquisition activity.\nThe Company’s definition of ARR may differ from definitions utilized by other companies reporting similarly named measures, and this metric should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements located in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K for a discussion on the impact to the Company relating to recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nContingencies\nLegal proceedings in which the Company is involved also may impact Moody’s liquidity or operating results. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. In addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. For information regarding legal proceedings, see Part II, Item 8 – “Financial Statements”, Note 21 “Contingencies” in this Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements and are based on future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company's business and operations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

As defined by the SEC in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nMoody’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Moody’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of the Company evaluated and assessed the design and operational effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on the assessment performed, management has concluded that Moody’s maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Moody's  internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n/s/ ROBERT FAUBER\nRobert Fauber\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ MARK KAYE\nMark Kaye\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 15, 2023\n64\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nMoody’s Corporation:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Moody’s Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     65\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGross uncertain tax positions\nAs discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded uncertain tax positions (UTPs), excluding associated interest, of $322 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nWe identified the assessment of the Company’s gross UTPs as a critical audit matter because complex judgment was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of the tax positions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s tax process, including those related to the timely identification of UTPs, the assessment of new information related to previously identified UTPs, and the measurement of UTPs. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Additionally, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\nevaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws and judgments about the administrative practices of tax authorities\n•\ninspecting settlement documents with applicable taxing authorities\n•\nassessing the expiration of statutes of limitations\n•\nperforming an assessment of the Company’s tax positions and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment.\nIn addition, we evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its gross UTPs by comparing historical gross UTPs to actual results upon conclusion of tax audits or expiration of the statute of limitations.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 15, 2023\n66\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     67\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(Amounts in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n68\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Amounts in millions, except share and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     69\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Amounts in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n70\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     71\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY continued\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n72\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY continued\n(Amounts in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n(1)\nRepresents a non-cash investing activity relating to the issuance of common stock to fund a portion of the purchase price for kompany.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     73\nMOODY’S CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(tabular dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data)\nNOTE 1\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nMoody’s is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations and investors to make better decisions. Moody’s reports in\ntwo\nreportable segments: MIS and MA.\nMIS publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities.\nMA is a global provider of: i) data and information; ii) research and insights; and iii) decision solutions, which help companies make better and faster decisions. MA leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks such as credit, market, financial crime, supply chain, catastrophe and climate to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current presentation.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards in 2022\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform - Scope,” which clarified the scope and application of the original guidance, ASU No. 2020-04, \"Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\" (\"ASU No. 2020-04\"), issued in March 2020 (codified into ASC Topic 848 \"Reference Rate Reform\"). ASU No. 2020-04 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, \"Reference Rate Reform—Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,\" which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. These ASU's were effective upon issuance, and the Company may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2024 as the transition from LIBOR is completed.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges and cross currency swaps designated as net investment hedges referencing three-month or six-month USD LIBOR with aggregate notional amounts as disclosed in Note 7. For derivative instruments that will be outstanding at the transition date, the Company intends to modify the contractual terms of the instruments to replace LIBOR with another reference rate, such as SOFR. Pursuant to the modification of the contractual terms of these instruments, the Company intends to utilize the various optional expedients set forth in ASC Topic 848 relating to derivative instruments used in hedging relationships.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\" (\"ASU No. 2021-08\"). This ASU requires companies to apply the definition of a performance obligation under ASC Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination. The adoption of this ASU will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC Topic 606. Accordingly, upon adoption, the Company will no longer be required to adjust acquired deferred revenue to fair value in business combination transactions. The amendments in ASU No. 2021-08 are applied prospectively and have been applied to business combination transactions completed subsequent to January 1, 2022.\nReclassification of Previously Reported Revenue by LOB\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company realigned its revenue by LOB reporting structure for the MA operating segment to enhance insight and transparency into this business. As of January 1, 2022, the MA LOBs have been realigned from RD&A and ERS to:\n–\nDecision Solutions (DS) -\nprovides software and workflow tools for specific use cases (banking, insurance, KYC/KYS, CRE and structured finance solutions). This LOB utilizes components from the Data & Information and Research & Insights LOBs to provide integrated risk solutions;\n–\nResearch & Insights (R&I) -\nprovides models, scores, expert insights and commentary. This LOB includes: credit research; credit models and analytics; and economics data and models; and\n–\nData & Information (D&I) -\nprovides vast data sets on companies and securities via data feeds and data applications products.\nPrior year revenue by LOB disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the new LOB reporting structure, which is presented in Note 3.\n74\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nNOTE 2\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include those of Moody’s Corporation and its majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The effects of all intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies for which the Company has significant influence over operating and financial policies but not a controlling interest are accounted for on an equity basis whereby the Company records its proportional share of the investment’s net income or loss as part of other non-operating income (expense), net and any dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for under the ASC 321 measurement alternative; these investments are recorded at initial cost, less impairment, adjusted upward or downward for any observable price changes in similar investments. The Company applies the guidelines set forth in Topic 810 of the ASC in assessing its interests in variable interest entities to decide whether to consolidate an entity. The Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under Topic 810 of the ASC. The Company consolidates its ICRA subsidiaries on a three month lag.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents principally consist of investments in money market deposit accounts as well as certificates of deposit with maturities of three months or less when purchased.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments are securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase that are available for operations in the next 12 months. The Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and their cost approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. Interest and dividends on these investments are recorded into income when earned.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets are charged to expense as incurred.\nComputer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use\nThe Company capitalizes costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. These assets, included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets, relate to the Company’s financial, website and other systems. Such costs generally consist of direct costs for third-party license fees, professional services provided by third parties and employee compensation, in each case incurred either during the application development stage or in connection with upgrades and enhancements that increase functionality. Such costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage of development as well as maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company also capitalizes implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements (e.g., hosted arrangements) and depreciates the costs over the non-cancellable term of the cloud computing arrangements plus any option renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised or for which the exercise is controlled by the service provider. The Company classifies the amortization of capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the statement of operations as the fees associated with the hosting service (i.e., operating and SG&A expense) and classifies the related payments in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting service (i.e. cash flows from operating activities). In addition, the capitalization of implementation costs is reflected in the balance sheet consistent with the location of prepayment of fees for the hosting element (i.e., within other current assets or other assets).\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nMoody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., MIS and MA), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment), annually as of July 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350.\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     75\nThe Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions, reporting unit realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. Goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units, and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.\nFor purposes of assessing the recoverability of goodwill, the Company has\nfour\nreporting units:\ntwo\nwithin the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations) and\ntwo\nreporting units within MA consisting of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and CRE solutions.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets\nLong-lived assets (including ROU Assets) and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nUnder the first step of the recoverability assessment, the Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  attributable to the asset or asset group to their carrying value. If the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value, no further assessment is required. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, Moody's proceeds with step two of the assessment. Under step two of this assessment, Moody's is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group (reduced by the estimated cost to sell the asset for assets or disposal groups classified as held-for-sale) and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records compensation expense over the requisite service period for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under stock option and restricted stock plans.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nBased on the Company’s risk management policy, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values on a gross basis. The changes in the value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the same income statement line item in earnings in which the corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is presented. The entire change in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded to OCI and such amounts are reclassified from AOCI(L) to the same income statement line in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The Company assesses effectiveness for net investment hedges using the spot-method. The entire change in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as net investment hedges is initially recorded to OCI. Those changes in fair value attributable to components included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in a net investment hedge are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of OCI and remain in AOCI(L) until the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Those changes in fair value attributable to components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in a net investment hedge are recorded to OCI and amortized to earnings using a systematic and rational method over the duration of the hedge. Any changes in the fair value of derivatives that the Company does not designate as hedging instruments under Topic 815 of the ASC are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they occur.\nRevenue Recognition and Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract with a Customer\nRevenue recognition:\nRevenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nWhen contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The Company determines the SSP by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or uses management’s best estimate of SSP for goods or services not sold separately using estimation techniques that maximize observable data points, including: internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives; standalone sales prices of similar products; pricing policies; percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service; and customer segment and geography. Additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trends.\nSales, usage-based, value added and other taxes are excluded from revenues.\nMIS Revenue\nIn the MIS segment, revenue arrangements with multiple elements are generally comprised of two distinct performance obligations, a rating and the related monitoring service. Revenue attributed to ratings of issued securities is generally recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the\n76\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nperiod in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of certain structured finance products, primarily CMBS, issuers can elect to pay all of the annual monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities.\nMIS arrangements generally have standard contractual terms for which the stated payments are due at conclusion of the ratings process for ratings and either upfront or in arrears for monitoring services; and are signed by customers either on a per issue basis or at the beginning of the relationship with the customer. In situations when customer fees for an arrangement may be variable, the Company estimates the variable consideration at inception using the expected value method based on analysis of similar contracts in the same line of business, which is constrained based on the Company’s assessment of the realization of the adjustment amount.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price within arrangements that include multiple performance obligations based upon the relative SSP of each service. The SSP for both rating and monitoring services is generally based upon observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately to similar customers.\nMA Revenue\nIn the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include hosted research and data subscriptions, installed and hosted software subscriptions, perpetual installed software licenses and related maintenance, or PCS, and professional services. Subscription and PCS contracts are generally invoiced in advance of the contractual coverage period, which is principally one year, but can range from\n3\n-\n5\nyears. Perpetual software licenses are generally invoiced upon delivery and professional services are invoiced as those services are provided. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, but primarily include a requirement of payment within\n30\nto\n60\ndays.\nRevenue from research, data and other hosted subscriptions is recognized ratably over the related subscription period as MA's performance obligation to provide access to these products is progressively fulfilled over the stated term of the contract. A large portion of these services are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.\nRevenue from the sale of a software license, when considered distinct from the related software implementation services, is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to the customer. PCS is generally recognized ratably over the contractual period commencing when the software license is fully delivered. Revenue from installed software subscriptions, which includes PCS, is bifurcated into a software license performance obligation and a PCS performance obligation, which follow the patterns of recognition described above.\nFor implementation services and other service projects for which fees are fixed, the Company determined progress towards completion is most accurately measured on a percentage-of-completion basis (input method) as this approach utilizes the most directly observable data points and is therefore used to recognize the related revenue. For implementation services where price varies based on time expended, a time-based measure of progress towards completion of the performance obligation is utilized.\nRevenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized over time as the services are performed.\nProducts and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for the individual performance obligations separately if they are considered distinct. Revenue is generally allocated to all performance obligations based upon the relative SSP at contract inception. For certain performance obligations, judgment is required to determine the SSP. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.\nIn the MA segment, customers usually pay a fixed fee for the products and services based on signed contracts. However, accounting for variable consideration is applied mainly for: i) estimates for cancellation rights and price concessions and ii) T&M based services.\nThe Company estimates the variable consideration associated with cancellation rights and price concessions based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduces the amount of revenue to be recognized.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract with a Customer:\nCosts to obtain a contract with a customer\nCosts incurred to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract, would not have been incurred otherwise and the Company expects to recover those costs. These costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of the products or services to the customer. Depending on the line of business to which the contract relates, this may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided, inclusive of anticipated contract renewals. Determining the estimated economic life of the products sold requires judgment with respect to anticipated future technological changes. Costs to obtain customer contracts are only incurred in the MA segment.\nCost to fulfill a contract with a customer\nCosts incurred to fulfill customer contracts, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs relate directly to a contract, generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and the Company expects to recover those costs.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     77\nThe Company capitalizes work-in-process costs for in-progress MIS ratings, which is recognized consistent with the rendering of the related services to the customers, as ratings are issued.\nIn addition, within the MA segment, the Company capitalizes royalty costs related to third-party information data providers associated with hosted company information and business intelligence products. These costs are amortized to expense consistent with the recognition pattern of the related revenue over time.\nAccounts Receivable Allowances\nIn order to determine an estimate of expected credit losses, receivables are segmented based on similar risk characteristics including historical credit loss patterns and industry or class of customers to calculate reserve rates. The Company uses an aging method for developing its allowance for credit losses by which receivable balances are stratified based on aging category. A reserve rate is calculated for each aging category which is generally based on historical information, and is adjusted, when necessary, for current conditions (e.g., macroeconomic or industry related) and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. The Company also considers customer specific information (e.g., bankruptcy or financial difficulty) when estimating its expected credit losses, as well as the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Expected credit losses are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual uncollectible account write-offs are recorded against the allowance.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases, which substantially all relate to the lease of office space. The Company’s leases which are classified as finance leases are not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement meets the definition of a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes in its consolidated balance sheet a lease liability and an ROU Asset for all leases with a lease term greater than 12 months. In determining the length of the lease term, the Company utilizes judgment in assessing the likelihood of whether it is reasonably certain that it will exercise an option to extend or early-terminate a lease, if such options are provided in the lease agreement.\nROU Assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU Assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As substantially all of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its estimated secured incremental borrowing rates at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. These secured incremental borrowing rates are attributable to the currency in which the lease is denominated.\nAt commencement, the Company’s initial measurement of the ROU Asset is calculated as the present value of the remaining lease payments (i.e., lease liability), with additive adjustments reflecting: initial direct costs (e.g., broker commissions) and prepaid lease payments (if any); and reduced by any lease incentives provided by the lessor if: (i) received before lease commencement or (ii) receipt of the lease incentive is contingent upon future events for which the occurrence is both probable and within the Company’s control.\nLease expense for minimum operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This straight-line lease expense represents a single lease cost which is comprised of both an interest accretion component relating to the lease liability and amortization of the ROU Assets. The Company records this single lease cost in operating and SG&A expenses. However, in situations where an operating lease ROU Asset has been impaired, the subsequent amortization of the ROU Asset is then recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and is combined with accretion expense on the lease liability to result in single operating lease cost (which subsequent to impairment will no longer follow a straight-line recognition pattern).\nThe Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components. For the Company’s office space leases, the lease components (e.g., fixed rent payments) and non-lease components (e.g., fixed common-area maintenance costs) are combined and accounted for as a single lease component.\nVariable lease payments (e.g. variable common-area-maintenance costs) are only included in the initial measurement of the lease liability to the extent those payments depend on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments not included in the lease liability are recognized in net income in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nContingencies\nMoody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.\nFor claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if\n78\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nmaterial. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. Moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. However, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses include costs associated with the development and production of the Company’s products and services and their delivery to customers. These expenses principally include employee compensation and benefits and travel costs that are incurred in connection with these activities. Operating expenses are charged to income as incurred.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses include such items as compensation and benefits for corporate officers and staff and compensation and other expenses related to sales. They also include items such as office rent, business insurance and professional fees. SG&A expenses are charged to income as incurred.\nForeign Currency Translation\nFor all operations outside the U.S. where the Company has designated the local currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of year exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the year. For these foreign operations, currency translation adjustments are recorded to other comprehensive income.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income represents the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period due to transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources including: foreign currency translation impacts; net actuarial gains and losses and net prior service costs related to pension and other retirement plans; and gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges or cash flow hedges. Comprehensive income items, including cumulative translation adjustments of entities that are less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests and thereby, adjusting accumulated other comprehensive income proportionately in accordance with the percentage of ownership interest of the non-controlling shareholder.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.\nThe Company classifies interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties are recognized in other non-operating expenses. For UTPs, the Company first determines whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, resulting in all previously undistributed foreign earnings being subject to U.S. tax. The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, and certain short-term investments consisting primarily of certificates of deposit and money market deposits, all of which are short-term in nature and, accordingly, approximate fair value.\nThe Company also invests in mutual funds, which are accounted for as equity securities with readily determinable fair values under ASC Topic 321. The Company measures these investments at fair value with both realized gains and losses and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments included in net income.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     79\nAlso, the Company uses derivative instruments to manage certain financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nFair value is defined by the ASC 820 as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of this fair value is based on the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company could commence transactions and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. Also, determination of fair value assumes that market participants will consider the highest and best use of the asset.\nThe ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy whereby the inputs contained in valuation techniques used to measure fair value are categorized into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1: quoted market prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the date of the fair value measurement;\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted market prices described in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;\nLevel 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables and derivatives.\nFor cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivatives, the Company manages its credit exposure by limiting the amount of counterparty risk with any particular financial institution; limits are assigned to each counterparty based on perceived quality of credit, and are monitored daily. Cash equivalents are held among various money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Derivatives primarily consist of foreign exchange forwards or swap contracts (interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. For trade receivables,\nno\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 or 2021.\nEarnings per Share of Common Stock\nBasic shares outstanding is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming that such shares were outstanding and dilutive during the reporting period.\nPension and Other Retirement Benefits\nMoody’s maintains various noncontributory DBPPs as well as other contributory and noncontributory retirement plans. The expense and assets/liabilities that the Company reports for its pension and other retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimates and may vary by plan. The differences between the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and actual experience is spread over a five-year period to the market-related value of plan assets, which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual pension expense. All other actuarial gains and losses are generally deferred and amortized over the estimated average future working life of active plan participants.\nThe Company recognizes as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet the funded status of its defined benefit retirement plans, measured on a plan-by-plan basis. Changes in the funded status due to actuarial gains/losses are recorded as part of other comprehensive income during the period the changes occur.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n80\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nNOTE 3\nREVENUES\nRevenue by Category\nThe following table presents the Company’s revenues disaggregated by LOB:\n(1)\nOther includes: recurring monitoring fees of a rated debt obligation and/or entities that issue such obligations as well as fees from programs such as commercial paper, medium term notes, and ICRA corporate finance revenue.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     81\nThe following table presents the Company’s revenues disaggregated by LOB and geographic area:\nThe following table presents the Company's reportable segment revenues disaggregated by segment and geographic region:\n82\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nThe following tables summarize the split between transaction and recurring revenue. In the MIS segment, excluding MIS Other, transaction revenue represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other one-time fees while recurring revenue represents the recurring monitoring fees of a rated debt obligation and/or entities that issue such obligations, as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper, medium-term notes and shelf registrations. In MIS Other, transaction revenue represents revenue from professional services and recurring revenue represents subscription-based revenues. In the MA segment, recurring revenue represents subscription-based revenues and software maintenance revenue. Transaction revenue in MA represents perpetual software license fees and revenue from software implementation services, risk management advisory projects, and training and certification services.\nThe following table presents the timing of revenue recognition:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     83\nUnbilled Receivables, Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nUnbilled receivables\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, accounts receivable included approximately $\n385\nmillion and $\n386\nmillion,  respectively, of unbilled receivables related to the MIS segment. Certain MIS arrangements contain contractual terms whereby the customers are billed in arrears for annual monitoring services and rating fees, requiring revenue to be accrued as an unbilled receivable as such services are provided.\nIn addition, for certain MA arrangements, the timing of when the Company has the unconditional right to consideration and recognizes revenue occurs prior to invoicing the customer. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, accounts receivable included approximately $\n148\nmillion and $\n152\nmillion, respectively, of unbilled receivables related to the MA segment.\nDeferred revenue\nThe Company recognizes deferred revenue when a contract requires a customer to pay consideration to the Company in advance of when revenue is recognized. This deferred revenue is relieved when the Company satisfies the related performance obligation and revenue is recognized.\nSignificant changes in the deferred revenue balances during the year ended December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nSignificant changes in the deferred revenue balances during the year ended December 31, 2021 are as follows:\nFor the MA segment, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in the deferred revenue balance was primarily due to acquisitions (Cortera, RMS, and PassFort) and organic growth.\n84\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nSignificant changes in the deferred revenue balances during the year ended December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nFor the MA segment, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the deferred revenue balance was primarily due to acquisitions (RDC, Acquire Media, ZMFS, and Catylist) and changes in FX translation rates.\nRemaining performance obligations\nRemaining performance obligations in the MIS segment largely reflect deferred revenue related to monitoring fees for certain structured finance products, primarily CMBS, where the issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees for the life of the security in advance. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $\n99\nmillion. The Company expects to recognize into revenue approximately\n25\n% of this balance within\none year\n, approximately\n50\n% of this balance between one to five years and the remaining amount thereafter. With respect to the remaining performance obligations for the MIS segment, the Company has applied a practical expedient set forth in ASC Topic 606 permitting the omission of unsatisfied performance obligations relating to contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\nRemaining performance obligations in the MA segment include both amounts recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 as well as amounts not yet invoiced to customers as of December 31, 2022 largely reflecting future revenue related to signed multi-year arrangements for hosted and installed subscription-based products. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $\n3.5\nbillion. The Company expects to recognize into revenue approximately\n60\n% of this balance within\none year\n, approximately\n25\n% of this balance between one to two years and the remaining amount thereafter.\nCosts to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract with a Customer\nMA Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nAmortization of costs incurred to obtain customer contracts is included within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Costs incurred to obtain customer contracts are only in the MA segment.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     85\nMIS and MA Costs to Fulfill a Contract with a Customer\nAmortization of costs to fulfill customer contracts is included within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nNOTE 4\nRECONCILIATION OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING\nBelow is a reconciliation of basic to diluted shares outstanding:\nThe calculation of diluted EPS requires certain assumptions regarding the use of both cash proceeds and assumed proceeds that would be received upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nNOTE 5\nACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution counterparty to repurchase $\n500\nmillion of its outstanding common stock. The Company paid $\n500\nmillion to the counterparty and received an initial delivery of\n1.2\nmillion shares of its common stock. Final settlement of the ASR agreement was completed in April 2022 and the Company received delivery of an additional\n0.3\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock.\nIn total, the Company repurchased\n1.5\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, based on the volume-weighted average price (net of discount) of $\n324.20\n/share over the duration of the program. The initial share repurchase and final share settlement were recorded as a reduction to shareholders’ equity.\n86\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nNOTE 6\nCASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS\nThe table below provides additional information on the Company’s cash equivalents and investments:\n(1)\nConsists of time deposits and money market deposit accounts. The remaining contractual maturities for the certificates of deposits classified as short-term investments are\none month\nto\n12\nmonths at both December 31, 2022 and at December 31, 2021. The remaining contractual maturities for the certificates of deposits classified in other assets are\n13\nmonths to\n24\nmonths at December 31, 2022 and\n13\nmonths to\n29\nmonths at December 31, 2021. Time deposits with a maturity of less than\n90\ndays at time of purchase are classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nIn addition, the Company invests in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI). As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the contract value of the COLI was $\n40\nmillion and $\n37\nmillion, respectively.\nNOTE 7\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including risks from changes in FX rates and changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the Company uses derivatives in certain instances to manage the aforementioned financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes.\nDerivatives and non-derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nFair Value Hedges\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month LIBOR, 6-month LIBOR, and SOFR. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk associated with changes in the fair value of the long-term debt, thus the Company has designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The fair value of the swaps is adjusted quarterly with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the debt. The changes in the fair value of the swaps and the underlying hedged item generally offset and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each period within interest expense, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:\n(1)\nExecuted in 2022.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     87\nRefer to Note 18 for information on the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of the above hedged items.\nThe following table summarizes the impact to the statements of operations of the Company’s interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:\nNet Investment Hedges\nDebt designated as net investment hedges\nThe Company has designated €\n500\nmillion of the 2015 Senior Notes Due 2027 and €\n750\nmillion of the 2019 Senior Notes due 2030 as net investment hedges to mitigate FX exposure related to a portion of the Company’s euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in euro/USD exchange rates. These hedges are designated as accounting hedges under the applicable sections of ASC Topic 815 and will end upon the repayment of the notes in 2027 and 2030, respectively, unless terminated early at the discretion of the Company.\nCross currency swaps designated as net investment hedges\nThe Company enters into cross-currency swaps to mitigate FX exposure related to a portion of the Company’s euro net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries against changes in euro/USD exchange rates.\nThe following table provides information on the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges under ASC Topic 815:\n88\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nAs of December 31, 2022, these hedges will expire and the notional amounts will be settled as follows unless terminated early at the discretion of the Company:\nThe following table provides information on the gains/(losses) on the Company’s net investment and cash flow hedges:\nThe cumulative amount of net investment hedge and cash flow hedge gains (losses) remaining in AOCL is as follows:\nDerivatives not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange forwards\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency. These forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges under the applicable sections of Topic 815 of the ASC. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately in other non-operating income, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations along with the FX gain or loss recognized on the assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. These contracts have expiration dates at various times through April 2023.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     89\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding foreign exchange forwards:\nNOTE: € = euro, £ = British pound, S$ = Singapore dollar, $ = U.S. dollar, ¥ = Japanese yen, C$ = Canadian dollar,\n₽\n= Russian ruble, ₹= Indian rupee\nThe following table summarizes the impact to the consolidated statements of operations relating to the net gain (loss) on the Company’s derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments:\n(1)\nThe Company entered into forward contracts to sell $\n1,675\nmillion for £\n1,200\nmillion to hedge a portion of the GBP denominated RMS purchase price. The contract was terminated on September 14, 2021 and resulted in a $\n13\nmillion loss.\nThe table below shows the classification between assets and liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets for the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the carrying value of its non-derivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges:\n90\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nNOTE 8\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of:\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to the above assets was $\n131\nmillion, $\n99\nmillion, and $\n96\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 9\nACQUISITIONS\nThe following is a discussion of material acquisitions completed by the Company. The business combinations described below are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at fair value on the date of the transaction. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded to goodwill. Goodwill typically results through expected synergies from combining operations of an acquiree and an acquirer, anticipated new customer acquisition and products, as well as from intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.\nWith the exception of RMS, the Company has not presented pro forma combined results for these acquisitions because the impact on previously reported statements of operations would not have been material.\nPassFort\nOn November 30, 2021, the Company acquired\n100\n% of PassFort, a U.K. SaaS-based workflow platform for identity verification, customer onboarding, and risk analysis.\nThe table below details the total consideration relating to the acquisition:\n(1)\nRepresents additional consideration paid to the sellers following finalization of customary post-closing completion adjustments.\nShown below is the purchase price allocation, which summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed, at the date of acquisition:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     91\nGoodwill\nThe goodwill recognized as a result of this acquisition includes, among other things, value created by combining the complementary risk assessment products of the Company and PassFort. The integration of PassFort’s platform into Moody’s suite of KYC and compliance offerings is expected to create a holistic workflow solution to benefit both new and existing Moody's customers.\nGoodwill, which has been assigned to the MA segment, is not deductible for tax purposes.\nTransaction costs\nTransaction costs directly related to the PassFort acquisition were not material.\nRMS\nOn September 15, 2021, the Company acquired\n100\n% of RMS, a global provider of climate and natural disaster risk modeling and analytics. The cash payment was funded with new debt financing and a combination of U.S. and offshore cash on hand. The acquisition will expand Moody’s insurance data and analytics business and accelerate the development of the Company’s global integrated risk capabilities to address the next generation of risk assessment.\nThe table below details the total consideration relating to the acquisition:\nShown below is the purchase price allocation, which summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed, at the date of acquisition:\n(1)\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company adjusted the purchase price allocation pursuant to the receipt of additional information from the sellers relating to RMS's pre-acquisition income taxes. These adjustments included a decrease to UTPs of $\n25\nmillion along with other immaterial adjustments. These adjustments resulted in a corresponding decrease in goodwill of $\n19\nmillion.\n92\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nGoodwill\nThe goodwill recognized as a result of this acquisition includes, among other things, the value of combining the complementary product portfolios of Moody's and RMS, which is expected to extend the Company's reach into new market segments. The goodwill also includes the combined company's ability to accelerate technology innovations into new product adjacencies (leveraging RMS's team of data scientists, modelers and software engineers) as well as combining RMS's products with Moody’s core data and analytics offerings to provide holistic integrated risk solutions.\nGoodwill, of which $\n1,267\nmillion and $\n90\nmillion has been assigned to the MA and MIS segments, respectively, is not deductible for tax purposes. The amount of goodwill allocated to the MIS segment relates to the integration of certain of RMS's models/processes into the Company's ESG solutions offerings.\nOther assets in the table above includes an indemnification asset of $\n95\nmillion related to uncertain tax positions assumed in the transaction, for which the Company expects to be indemnified by the sellers in the event of an unfavorable outcome.\nTransaction costs\nTransaction costs directly related to the RMS acquisition were $\n22\nmillion and were recorded in SG&A expenses in the statement of operations.\nSupplementary Unaudited Pro Forma Information\nSupplemental information on an unaudited pro forma basis is presented below for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as if the acquisition of RMS occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only, based on certain estimates and assumptions, which the Company believes to be reasonable but not necessarily indicative of future results of operations or the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had been completed at January 1, 2020. The unaudited pro forma information includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, based on the purchase price allocation and an estimate of useful lives reflected above, and incremental financing costs resulting from the acquisition, net of income tax, which was estimated using the weighted average statutory tax rates in effect in the jurisdiction for which the pro forma adjustment relates.\nThe unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of RMS. Accordingly, the pro forma results above are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated, nor are the pro forma results indicative of results which may occur in the future. The RMS results included in the above have been converted to U.S. GAAP from IFRS as issued by the IASB and have been translated to USD at rates in effect for the periods presented. The RMS amounts in the pro forma results include an addition to revenue of approximately $\n18\nmillion and a reduction to revenue of approximately $\n22\nmillion relating to a fair value adjustment to deferred revenue required as part of acquisition accounting for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCortera\nOn March 19, 2021, the Company acquired\n100\n% of Cortera, a provider of North American credit data and workflow solutions.\nThe table below details the total consideration relating to the acquisition:\n(1)\nRepresents additional consideration paid to the sellers following finalization of customary post-closing completion adjustments.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     93\nShown below is the purchase price allocation, which summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed, at the date of acquisition:\n(1)\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company received further information, that existed as of the acquisition date, with respect to Cortera’s deferred taxes. Accordingly, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment of $\n16\nmillion to its estimate for deferred tax assets.\nCurrent assets in the table above include acquired cash of $\n4\nmillion and accounts receivable of approximately $\n2\nmillion.\nGoodwill\nThe goodwill recognized as a result of this acquisition includes, among other things, the value of combining the complementary risk assessment products of the Company and Cortera, which is expected to extend the Company’s reach to new and evolving market segments as well as cost savings synergies, expected new customer acquisitions and products.\nGoodwill, which has been assigned to the MA segment, is not deductible for tax purposes.\nTransaction costs\nTransaction costs directly related to the Cortera acquisition were not material.\nRDC\nOn February 13, 2020, the Company acquired\n100\n% of RDC, a provider of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer data and due diligence services.\nThe table below details the total consideration relating to the acquisition:\n(1)\nRepresents additional consideration paid to the sellers following finalization of customary post-closing completion adjustments.\n94\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nShown below is the purchase price allocation, which summarizes the fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed, at the date of acquisition:\nCurrent assets in the table above include acquired cash of $\n6\nmillion. Additionally, current assets include accounts receivable of approximately $\n14\nmillion.\nGoodwill\nThe goodwill recognized as a result of this acquisition includes, among other things, the value of combining the complementary product portfolios of the Company and RDC, which is expected to extend the Company’s reach to new and evolving market segments as well as cost savings synergies, expected new customer acquisitions and products.\nGoodwill, which has been assigned to the MA segment, is not deductible for tax purposes.\nTransaction costs\nTransaction costs directly related to the RDC acquisition were not material.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company acquired\nthree\nadditional businesses within the MA reportable segment, which were not individually material, but are material in aggregate, to Moody's consolidated financial statements:\n–\nIn December 2020, the Company acquired\n100\n% of Catylist, Inc., a provider of commercial real estate solutions for brokers.\n–\nIn December 2020, the Company acquired\n100\n% of ZM Financial Systems, a provider of financial management software for the U.S. banking sector.\n–\nIn October 2020, the Company acquired\n100\n% of Acquire Media, an aggregator and distributor of curated real-time news, multimedia, data, and alerts.\nThe aggregate consideration transferred for the aforementioned acquisitions of $\n205\nmillion was funded by cash on hand.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     95\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the respective closing dates for each acquisition.\nNOTE 10\nGOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following tables summarize the activity in goodwill:\n(1)\nThe 2022 additions/adjustments for the MA segment in the table above primarily relate to the acquisition of kompany in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by RMS measurement period adjustments in the third quarter of 2022, which are more fully discussed in Note 9.\n(2)\nThe 2021 additions/adjustments for the MA segment in the table above relate to the acquisitions of Cortera, RMS, RealXData, Bogard, and PassFort. The 2021 additions/adjustments for the MIS segment relate to certain revenue synergies from the RMS acquisition that are expected to benefit the ESG solutions group within the MIS Other LOB.\n96\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nAcquired intangible assets and related accumulated amortization consisted of:\n(1)\nOther intangible assets primarily consist of trade secrets, covenants not to compete, and acquired ratings methodologies and models.\nAmortization expense relating to acquired intangible assets is as follows:\nEstimated future annual amortization expense for intangible assets subject to amortization is as follows:\nNOTE 11\nRESTRUCTURING\nOn June 30, 2022, the chief executive officer of Moody’s approved a restructuring program (the “2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program”) for which the scope was expanded in October 2022. The Company estimates that the program will result in annualized savings of $\n100\nmillion to $\n135\nmillion per year. This program relates to the Company's post-COVID-19 geolocation strategy and includes the rationalization and exit of certain leased office spaces and a reduction in staff, including the relocation of certain job functions. The exit from certain leased office spaces began late in 2022 and is expected to result in $\n50\nmillion to $\n70\nmillion of pre-tax charges from vacating the affected office spaces, a large portion of which Moody's intends to sublease. The program also includes $\n85\nmillion to $\n100\nmillion of pre-tax personnel-related restructuring charges, an amount that includes severance costs, expense related to the modification of equity awards and related costs primarily determined under the Company’s existing severance plans. The savings generated from the 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program are expected to strengthen the Company's operating margin, with a portion being deployed to support strategic investments, including the Company's workplace of the future program and employee retention initiatives. The 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2023. Cash outlays associated with this program are expected to be $\n85\nmillion to $\n100\nmillion, which are expected to be paid through 2024.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     97\nOn December 22, 2020, the chief executive officer of Moody’s approved a restructuring program (the “2020 MA Strategic Reorganization Restructuring Program”) that the Company estimates will result in annualized savings of $\n20\nmillion per year. This program related to a strategic reorganization in the MA reportable segment consisting of severance and related costs primarily determined under the Company’s existing severance plans. The 2020 MA Strategic Reorganization Restructuring Program resulted in a total of $\n19\nmillion in pre-tax charges and was substantially completed in the first half of 2021.\nOn July 29, 2020, the chief executive officer of Moody’s approved a restructuring program (the “2020 Real Estate Rationalization Restructuring Program”) primarily in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which revolved around the rationalization and exit of certain leased office spaces. The exit from certain leased office space began in the third quarter of 2020 and was substantially completed at December 31, 2021. The 2020 Real Estate Rationalization Restructuring Program primarily reflected non-cash charges related to the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements. The 2020 Restructuring Program is expected to result in an estimated annualized savings of approximately $\n5\nmillion to $\n6\nmillion a year.\nTotal expenses included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations relating to the Company's restructuring programs are as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes severance costs and expense related to the modification of equity awards.\n(2)\nPrimarily includes ROU Asset and leasehold improvement impairment charges and the non-cash acceleration of amortization of abandoned ROU assets and leasehold improvements for the year ended December 31, 2022. The fair value of the impaired assets was determined by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets. The fair value of those assets subsequent to the impairment was $\n0\n.\n(3)\nPrimarily includes professional service fees related to execution of the 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program.\n(4)\nIncludes ROU Asset impairment charges and the non-cash acceleration of amortization of leasehold improvements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The fair value of the impaired ROU Assets was determined by utilizing the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets. The fair value of those ROU assets subsequent to the impairment was $\n10\nmillion and was categorized as Level 3 within the ASC Topic 820 fair value hierarchy.\n98\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\n(1)\nRestructuring liability is primarily comprised of employee termination costs, with an immaterial amount of real estate-related and other costs.\nAs of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the remaining $\n65\nmillion restructuring liability is expected to be paid out in 2023.\nNOTE 12\nFAIR VALUE\nThe tables below present information about items which are carried at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     99\n(1)\nRepresents FX forwards on certain assets and liabilities as well as interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps as more fully described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following are descriptions of the methodologies utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of its derivative contracts and mutual funds:\nDerivatives:\nIn determining the fair value of the derivative contracts in the table above, the Company utilizes industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using spot rates, forward points, currency volatilities, interest rates as well as the risk of non-performance of the Company and the counterparties with whom it has derivative contracts. The Company established strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions that adhere to these guidelines. Accordingly, the risk of counterparty default is deemed to be minimal.\nMutual funds:\nThe mutual funds in the table above are deemed to be equity securities with readily determinable fair values with changes in the fair value recognized through net income under ASC Topic 321. The fair value of these instruments is determined using Level 1 inputs as defined in the ASC Topic 820.\nNOTE 13.\nOTHER BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION\nThe following tables contain additional detail related to certain balance sheet captions:\n100\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nInvestments in non-consolidated affiliates:\nThe following table provides additional detail regarding Moody's investments in non-consolidated affiliates, as included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets:\n(1)\nEquity securities in which the Company has significant influence over the investee but does not have a controlling financial interest in accordance with ASC Topic 323.\n(2)\nEquity securities without readily determinable fair value for which the Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative in accordance with ASC Topic 321, which is more fully discussed in Note 2.\nMoody's holds various investments accounted for under the equity method, the most significant of which is the Company's minority investment in CCXI. Moody's also holds various investments measured using the measurement alternative, the most significant of which is the Company's minority interest in BitSight.\nRefer to Note 24 for disclosure on earnings from non-consolidated affiliates, which are included within other non-operating income, net.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     101\nNOTE 14\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe following table provides details about the reclassifications out of AOCL:\n102\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nThe following tables show changes in AOCL by component (net of tax):\nNOTE 15\nPENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nU.S. Plans\nMoody’s maintains funded and unfunded noncontributory Defined Benefit Pension Plans (\"DBPPs\"). The DBPPs provide defined benefits using a cash balance formula based on years of service and career average salary or final average pay for selected executives. The Company also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired U.S. employees. The retirement healthcare plans are contributory; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. Moody’s funded and unfunded U.S. pension plans, the U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Retirement Plans.” The U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Other Retirement Plans.”\nThrough 2007, substantially all U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Company’s DBPPs. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company no longer offers DBPPs to U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008 and new hires in the U.S. instead will receive a retirement contribution in similar benefit value under the Company’s Profit Participation Plan. Current participants of the Company’s Retirement Plans and Other Retirement Plans continue to accrue benefits based on existing plan benefit formulas.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     103\nFollowing is a summary of changes in benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the Retirement Plans for the years ended December 31:\nThe net decrease in the pension benefit obligation from assumption changes and actuarial gains in 2022 primarily resulted from increases to discount rates, partially offset by an increase to the annuity conversion rate. The net decrease in the pension benefit obligation from assumption changes and actuarial losses in 2021 primarily resulted from increases to the discount rates and changes to certain actuarial assumptions, including increased rates of retirement at younger ages.\nThe following information is for those pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nThe following table summarizes the pre-tax net actuarial losses and prior service costs recognized in AOCL for the Company’s Retirement Plans as of December 31:\n104\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nNet periodic benefit expenses recognized for the Retirement Plans for the years ended December 31:\nThe following table summarizes the pre-tax amounts recorded in OCI related to the Company’s Retirement Plans for the years ended December 31:\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\nAssumptions—Retirement Plans\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31:\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit expense for years ended December 31:\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and is determined by using a building block approach, which generally weighs the underlying long-term expected rate of return for each major asset class based on their respective allocation target within the plan portfolio, net of plan paid expenses. As the assumption reflects a long-term time horizon, the plan performance in any one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence the Company’s evaluation. For 2022, the expected rate of return used in calculating the net periodic benefit costs was\n5.05\n%. For 2023, the Company’s expected rate of return assumption is\n6.55\n% to reflect the Company’s current view of long-term capital market outlook.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     105\nPlan Assets\nMoody’s investment objective for the assets in the funded pension plan is to earn total returns that will minimize future contribution requirements over the long-term within a prudent level of risk. The Company works with its independent investment consultants to determine asset allocation targets for its pension plan investment portfolio based on its assessment of business and financial conditions, demographic and actuarial data, funding characteristics, and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including historical and forward looking views of inflation and capital market returns, are also considered. Risk management practices include monitoring plan asset performance, diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. The Company’s Asset Management Committee is responsible for overseeing the investment activities of the plan, which includes selecting acceptable asset classes, defining allowable ranges of holdings by asset class and by individual investment managers, defining acceptable securities within each asset class, and establishing investment performance expectations. Ongoing monitoring of the plan includes reviews of investment performance and managers on a regular basis, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.\nThe Company’s investment policy uses risk-controlled investment strategies by increasing the plan’s asset allocation to fixed income securities and specifying ranges of acceptable target allocation by asset class based on different levels of the plan’s accounting funded status. In addition, the investment policy also requires the investment-grade fixed income assets to be rebalanced between shorter and longer duration bonds as the interest rate environment changes. This investment policy is designed to help protect the plan’s funded status and to limit volatility of the Company’s contributions. Based on the policy, the Company’s current target asset allocation is approximately\n33\n% (range of\n28\n% to\n38\n%) in equity securities,\n62\n% (range of\n57\n% to\n67\n%) in fixed income securities and\n5\n% (range of\n2\n% to\n8\n%) in other investments and the plan will use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different investment styles for its investment portfolios within each asset class. The plan’s equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks of small, medium and large capitalization. The plan’s fixed income investments are diversified principally across U.S. and non-U.S. government and corporate bonds, which are expected to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with obligations. The plan also invests in other fixed income investments such as debts rated below investment grade, emerging market debt, and convertible securities. The plan’s other investment, which is made through a private real estate debt fund, is expected to provide additional diversification benefits and absolute return enhancement to the plan assets.\nFair value of the assets in the Company’s funded pension plan by asset category at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\n106\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\n(1)\nInvestments are measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table are intended to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the value of the total plan assets.\nCash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in money market mutual funds. In determining fair value, Level 1 investments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Investments in common/collective trust and private mutual  funds are valued using the NAV per unit in each fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying investments owned by each fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Common/collective trust funds and the private mutual fund are categorized in Level 2 to the extent that they are considered to have a readily determinable fair value. Investments for which fair value is estimated by using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\nExcept for the Company’s U.S. funded pension plan, all of Moody’s Retirement Plans are unfunded and therefore have no plan assets.\nCash Flows\nThe Company did not contribute to its U.S. funded pension plan during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company made payments of $\n7\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion related to its U.S. unfunded pension plan obligations during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company currently does\nnot\nanticipate making a contribution to its funded pension plan in 2023, and anticipates making payments of $\n6\nmillion related to its unfunded U.S. pension plans and\nimmaterial\npayments related to its other Retirement Plans during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     107\nEstimated Future Benefits Payable\nEstimated future benefits payments for the Retirement Plans are as follows as of the year ended December 31, 2022:\nDefined Contribution Plans\nMoody’s has a Profit Participation Plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Profit Participation Plan provides for an employee salary deferral and the Company matches employee contributions, equal to\n50\n% of employee contribution up to a maximum of\n3\n% of the employee’s pay. Effective January 1, 2008, all new hires are automatically enrolled in the Profit Participation Plan when they meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. As the Company’s U.S. DBPPs are closed to new entrants effective January 1, 2008, all eligible new hires will instead receive a retirement contribution into the Profit Participation Plan in value similar to the pension benefits. Additionally, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented a deferred compensation plan in the U.S., which is unfunded and provides for employee deferral of compensation and Company matching contributions related to compensation in excess of the IRS limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified retirement plans. Total expenses associated with U.S. defined contribution plans were $\n35\nmillion, $\n54\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEffective January 1, 2008, Moody’s has designated the Moody’s Stock Fund, an investment option under the Profit Participation Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in the Moody’s Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the Moody’s Stock Fund. Moody’s paid approximately $\n1\nmillion during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, for the Company’s common shares held by the Moody’s Stock Fund. The Company records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. The Moody’s Stock Fund held approximately\n329,300\nand\n328,500\nshares of Moody’s common stock at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNon-U.S. Plans\nCertain of the Company’s non-U.S. operations provide pension benefits to their employees. The non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are immaterial. For defined contribution plans, company contributions are primarily determined as a percentage of employees’ eligible compensation. Expenses related to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $\n37\nmillion, $\n32\nmillion, and $\n29\nmillion, respectively.\nNOTE 16\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nUnder the 1998 Plan,\n33.0\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance. The 2001 Plan, which is shareholder approved, permits the granting of up to\n50.6\nmillion shares, of which not more than\n14.0\nmillion shares are available for grants of awards other than stock options. The stock plans also provide for the granting of restricted stock. The stock plans provide that options are exercisable not later than\nten years\nfrom the grant date. The vesting period for awards under the stock plans is generally determined by the Board at the date of the grant and has been\nfour years\nexcept for employees who are at or near retirement eligibility, as defined, for which vesting is between\none\nand\nfour years\n. Additionally, the vesting period is\nthree years\nfor certain performance-based restricted stock that contain a condition whereby the number of shares that ultimately vest are based on the achievement of certain non-market based performance metrics of the Company. Options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant.\nThe Company maintains the Directors’ Plan for its Board, which permits the granting of awards in the form of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock or performance shares. The vesting period is determined by the Board at the date of the grant and is generally\none year\nfor both options and restricted stock. Under the Directors’ Plan,\n1.7\nmillion shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. Any director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date that an award is granted is eligible to participate in the Directors’ Plan.\nOn September 15, 2021, the Company acquired RMS, which is discussed in more detail in Note 9. As part of the acquisition, the Company registered the RMS 2014 Equity Award Plan and the RMS 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, \"RMS Plans\") as part of the purchase agreement to acquire RMS. Under the RMS Plans,\n1.2\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance. The RMS Plans provide that options are exercisable not later than\nten years\nfrom the grant date. The vesting period is generally determined by the Board at the date of the grant and is\nfour years\nfor both options and restricted stock granted during 2021.\n108\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nAs a result of the acquisition, certain RMS employees' unvested equity awards (employee stock options and restricted stock) with an acquisition-date fair value of $\n33\nmillion were converted into equity awards of the Company based on an exchange ratio as defined in the purchase agreement. The portion of the fair value of the replacement awards related to services provided prior to the acquisition was $\n5\nmillion and was accounted for as consideration transferred (See Note 9). The remaining portion of the replacement awards of $\n28\nmillion, which is associated with post-acquisition service requirements, will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting period.\nPresented below is a summary of the stock-based compensation expense and associated tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:\nThe fair value of each employee stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted below. The expected dividend yield is derived from the annual dividend rate on the date of grant. The expected stock volatility is based on an assessment of historical weekly stock prices of the Company as well as implied volatility from Moody’s traded options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the expected holding period. The expected holding period is determined by examining historical and projected post-vesting exercise behavior activity.\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used for options granted (excluding the aforementioned RMS replacement awards for the year ended December 31, 2021):\nDue to the RMS replacement option awards being heavily in-the-money at the acquisition date, the Company utilized a binomial valuation approach in 2021 to determine the fair value of the options, which approximated the intrinsic value of the replaced awards at the acquisition date.\nThe following represents the fair value of the options at grant date (including the RMS replacement option awards for the year ended December 31, 2021):\nA summary of option activity as of December 31, 2022 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between Moody’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the year ended December 31, 2022 and the exercise prices, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of December 31, 2022. This amount varies based on the fair value of Moody’s stock. As of December 31, 2022, there was $\n14\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to options. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.0\nyears.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     109\nThe following table summarizes information relating to stock option exercises:\nA summary of nonvested restricted stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented below:\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $\n216\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested restricted stock. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.4\nyears.\nThe following table summarizes information relating to the vesting of restricted stock awards:\nA summary of performance-based restricted stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is presented below:\nThe following table summarizes information relating to the vesting of the Company’s performance-based restricted stock awards:\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $\n22\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to this plan. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.4\nyears.\nThe Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy shares issued under stock-based compensation plans.\nIn addition, the Company also sponsors the ESPP. Under the ESPP,\n6\nmillion shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock of the Company on a monthly basis at a discount to the average of the high and the low trading prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day of each month. This discount was\n5\n% in 2022, 2021, and 2020 resulting in the ESPP qualifying for non-compensatory status under Topic 718 of the ASC. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for the ESPP in 2022, 2021, and 2020. The employee purchases are funded through after-tax payroll deductions, which plan participants can elect from\none\npercent to\nten\npercent of compensation, subject to the annual federal limit.\n110\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nNOTE 17\nINCOME TAXES\nComponents of the Company’s income tax provision are as follows:\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate on income before provision for income taxes is as follows:\nThe source of income before provision for income taxes is as follows:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     111\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which resulted in significant changes to U.S. corporate tax laws. The Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time deemed repatriation tax (“transition tax”) on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and beginning in 2018 reduces the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Accordingly, the Company determined the transition tax to be $\n236\nmillion, with the remaining balance due of $\n48\nmillion as of December 31, 2022.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to U.S. tax. The Company regularly evaluates which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings. The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested.\nThe Company’s annual tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes Excess Tax Benefits from stock compensation of $\n19\nmillion, benefits from the resolution of certain UTPs of $\n30\nmillion and other net increases to tax positions of $\n12\nmillion.\nThe Company had valuation allowances of $\n21\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to foreign net operating losses for which realization is uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $\n322\nmillion of UTPs of which $\n297\nmillion represents the amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. The decrease in 2022 resulted primarily from lapses in statutes of limitation for non-U.S. jurisdictions along with state income tax settlement payments. The decrease in 2021 resulted primarily from the resolutions of uncertain tax positions. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to the additional reserves established for non-U.S. tax exposures.\n112\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of UTPs is as follows:\nThe Company classifies interest related to UTPs in interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized in other non-operating (expense) income, net. Refer to Note 18 for disclosure of interest (expense) income relating to UTPs and other tax-related liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the amount of accrued interest recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to UTPs was $\n47\nmillion, $\n59\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion, respectively.\nMoody’s Corporation and subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2017 through 2020 are currently under examination and 2021 remains open to examination. The Company’s New York City tax returns for 2015 through 2017 are currently under examination. After the resolution of a tax audit for 2012, certain of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries’ returns from 2012 to 2021 remain open to examination.\nFor current ongoing matters related to open tax years, the Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that a significant portion of the balance of UTPs could decrease in the next twelve months as a result of the effective settlement of these audits. Given the number of years and nature of matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions both in the U.S. and internationally, the Company is unable to estimate a range of possible changes to its UTPs for 2023. It is also possible that new issues might be raised by tax authorities which might necessitate increases to the balance of UTPs. As the Company is unable to predict the timing of conclusion of these audits, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of changes to the balance of UTPs at this time. However, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for its financial exposure relating to all open tax years, by tax jurisdiction, in accordance with ASC Topic 740.\nIn August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a corporate minimum tax on book earnings of 15%, an excise tax on corporate share repurchases of 1%, and certain climate change and energy tax credit incentives. The adoption of a corporate minimum tax of 15% is not expected to impact Moody’s ETR. The excise tax of 1% on corporate share buybacks will not have an impact on the Company’s ETR.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     113\nNOTE 18\nINDEBTEDNESS\nThe Company’s debt is recorded at its carrying amount, which represents the issuance amount plus or minus any issuance premium or discount, except for certain debt as depicted in the table below, which is recorded at the carrying amount adjusted for the fair value of an interest rate swap used to hedge the fair value of the note.\nThe following table summarizes total indebtedness:\n(1)\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps in the tables above represents the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of the hedged debt.\n114\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nCredit Facility\nThe following summarizes information relating to the Company's revolving credit facility:\nInterest on borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility is payable at rates that are based on an adjusted term SOFR Rate plus a premium that can range from\n80.5\nbasis points to\n122.5\nbasis points, depending on the Company’s index debt ratings, as set forth in the 2021 Facility Agreement. The Company also has the option to choose other rates, such as those based on adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or an alternate base rate as set forth in the 2021 Facility Agreement. The Company also pays quarterly facility fees, regardless of borrowing activity under the Facility. The quarterly fees for the 2021 Facility can range from\n7\nbasis points of the 2021 Credit Facility amount to\n15\nbasis points, depending on the Company’s index debt ratings. The facility fees for the 2021 Credit Facility are subject to sustainability-based pricing adjustments based on the Company’s annual performance with respect to certain spending with vendors who have committed to and publicly announced the setting of science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2021 Facility contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a total debt to EBITDA Ratio of (i) not more than\n4\nto 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter or (ii) not more than\n4.5\nto 1 as of the end of the first three consecutive quarters immediately following any acquisition with consideration in excess of $\n500\nmillion, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the 2021 Facility.\nCommercial Paper\nOn August 3, 2016, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $\n1.0\nbillion. Borrowings under the CP Program are backstopped by the 2021 Facility. Amounts under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The maturity of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed\n397\ndays from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the LIBOR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The CP Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non-payment of principal, interest or fees; entrance into any form of moratorium; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has\nno\nCP borrowings outstanding.\nNotes Payable\nThe Company may prepay certain of its senior notes, in whole or in part, but may incur a Make Whole amount penalty.\nDuring 2022, the Company issued the 2022 Senior Notes due 2052 and the 2022 Senior Notes due 2032. The key terms of these debt issuances are set forth in the table above.\nIn 2022, the Company fully repaid $\n500\nmillion of the 2017 Senior Notes due 2023 via a tender offer.\nAdditionally, in December 2022, the Company repaid a portion of its outstanding\n2.55\n% 2020 Senior Notes due 2060 via a partial tender offer. Pursuant to this tender offer, the Company early redeemed $\n200\nmillion in principal amount of the notes for $\n126\nmillion, resulting in a net $\n70\nmillion gain on extinguishment. This gain on extinguishment is net of $\n4\nmillion related to unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs associated with the principal amount that was repaid.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. All the debt agreements contain cross default provisions which state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2022, there were no such cross defaults.\nThe repayment schedule for the Company’s borrowings is as follows:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     115\nInterest expense, net\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest as presented in the consolidated statements of operations:\n(1)\nThe amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a $\n45\nmillion benefit relating to the reversal of tax-related interest accruals pursuant to the resolution of tax matters.\n(2)\nInterest paid includes net settlements on interest rate swaps more fully discussed in Note 7.\nThe fair value and carrying value of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nThe fair value of the Company’s debt is estimated based on quoted prices in active markets as of the reporting date, which are considered Level 1 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.\nNOTE 19\nCAPITAL STOCK\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Company has authority to issue under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation is\n1.02\nbillion shares with a par value of $\n0.01\n, of which\n1.0\nbillion are shares of common stock,\n10.0\nmillion are shares of preferred stock and\n10.0\nmillion are shares of series common stock. The preferred stock and series common stock can be issued with varying terms, as determined by the Board.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe Company first implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1 program and has maintained its program since. Moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter.\nThe table below summarizes the Company’s remaining authority under its share repurchase program as of December 31, 2022:\nDuring 2022, Moody’s repurchased\n3.1\nmillion shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program and issued a net\n0.6\nmillion shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. The net amount includes shares withheld for employee payroll taxes.\n116\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nDividends\nThe Company’s cash dividends were:\nOn\nJanuary 30, 2023\n, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $\n0.77\nper share of Moody’s common stock, payable on\nMarch 17, 2023\nto shareholders of record at the close of business on\nFebruary 24, 2023\n. The continued payment of dividends at the rate noted above, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board.\nNOTE 20\nLEASE COMMITMENTS\nThe Company has operating leases, substantially all of which relate to the lease of office space. The Company's leases classified as finance leases are not material to the consolidated financial statements. Certain of the Company's leases include options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease from\none\nto\n20\nyears at the Company's discretion.\nThe following table presents the components of the Company’s lease cost:\nDuring 2022, the Company recorded $\n23\nmillion of ROU Asset impairment charges related to the exit of certain real estate leases. The impairment charges were recorded within Restructuring expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Note 11 for further details.\nThe following tables present other information related to the Company’s operating leases:\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     117\nThe following table presents a maturity analysis of the future minimum lease payments included within the Company’s operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2022:\nNOTE 21\nCONTINGENCIES\nGiven the nature of the Company's activities, Moody’s and its subsidiaries are subject to legal and tax proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations, subpoenas and other inquiries, and claims and litigation by governmental and private parties that are based on ratings assigned by MIS or that are otherwise incidental to the Company’s business. Moody’s and MIS also are subject to periodic reviews, inspections, examinations and investigations by regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines, penalties or restrictions on business activities. Moody’s also is subject to ongoing tax audits as addressed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. Moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. However, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.\nNOTE 22\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company is organized into\ntwo\noperating segments: MIS and MA and accordingly, the Company reports in\ntwo\nreportable segments: MIS and MA.\nThe MIS segment consists of\nfive\nLOBs. The CFG, SFG, FIG and PPIF LOBs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. The MIS Other LOB primarily consists of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region, ICRA non-ratings revenue and revenue from providing ESG research, data and assessments.\nThe MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. The MA segment consists of\nthree\nLOBs - Decision Solutions, Research and Insights, and Data and Information.\nRevenue for MIS and expenses for MA include intersegment fees charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. Additionally, revenue for MA and expenses for MIS include an intersegment fee charged to MIS from MA for certain MA products and services utilized in MIS’s ratings process. These intersegment fees are generally based on the market value of the products and services being transferred between the segments.\n118\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K\nOverhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and legal. Such costs and corporate expenses that exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment.\nFor overhead costs and corporate expenses that benefit both segments, costs are allocated to each segment based on the segment’s share of full-year 2018 actual revenue which comprises a “Baseline Pool” established in 2019, which will remain fixed over time. In subsequent periods, incremental overhead costs (or reductions thereof) will be allocated to each segment based on the prevailing shares of total revenue represented by each segment.\n“Eliminations” in the following table represent intersegment revenue/expense. Moody’s does not report the Company’s assets by reportable segment, as this metric is not used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by reportable segment.\nFinancial Information by Segment\nThe table below shows revenue and Adjusted Operating Income by reportable segment. Adjusted Operating Income is a financial metric utilized by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to assess the profitability of each reportable segment. Refer to Note 3 for further details on the components of the Company’s revenue.\nThe table below shows cumulative restructuring expense incurred through December 31, 2022 by reportable segment.\nThe costs expected to be incurred related to the 2022 - 2023 Geolocation Restructuring Program are $\n70\nmillion - $\n90\nmillion for the MIS segment and $\n65\nmillion - $\n80\nmillion for the MA segment.\nThe restructuring programs are more fully discussed in Note 11.\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K     119\nCONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS INFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\nNOTE 23\nVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS\nAccounts receivable allowances represent estimates for uncollectible accounts. The valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relates to foreign net operating tax losses for which realization is uncertain.\nBelow is a summary of activity:\n(1)\nReflects write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable or expiration of foreign net operating tax losses.\nNOTE 24\nOTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET\nThe following table summarizes the components of other non-operating income, net as presented in the consolidated statements of operations:\n(1)\nThe amount for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes FX translation losses of $\n20\nmillion reclassified to earnings resulting from the Company no longer conducting commercial operations in Russia.\n(2)\nThe amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a loss on a forward contract to hedge a portion of the RMS British pound-denominated purchase price.\n(3)\nThe amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a $\n36\nmillion non-cash gain relating to the exchange of Moody’s minority investment in VisibleRisk (accounted for under the equity method) for shares of BitSight, a cybersecurity ratings company.\n120\nMOODY'S\n2022 10-K"
