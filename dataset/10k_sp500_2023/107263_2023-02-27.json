    "text": "In this report, Williams (which includes The Williams Companies, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise indicates, all of our subsidiaries) is at times referred to in the first person as “we,” “us,” or “our.” We also sometimes refer to Williams as the “Company.”\nGENERAL\nWe are an energy company committed to being the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. We have operations in 14 supply areas that provide natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission services, NGLs fractionation, transportation, and storage services, and marketing services to more than 700 customers. We own an interest in and operate over 33,000 miles of pipelines in 25 states, 29 natural gas processing facilities, 7 NGL fractionation facilities, approximately 24 million barrels of NGL storage capacity, and 290.4 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity, and deliver natural gas that is used every day for clean-power generation, heating, and industrial use.\nWe were founded in 1908, originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WMB.” Our operations are located in the United States. Williams’ headquarters are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with other major offices in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 800-945-5426 (800-WILLIAMS).\n5\nService Assets, Customers, and Contracts\nKey variables for our businesses will continue to be:\n•\nObstacles to our expansion efforts, including delays or denials of necessary permits and opposition to hydrocarbon-based energy development;\n•\nProducer drilling activities impacting natural gas supplies supporting our gathering and processing volumes;\n•\nRetaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide reliable services;\n•\nRevenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either completed or currently under construction;\n•\nPrices impacting our commodity-based activities;\n•\nDisciplined growth in our service areas.\nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Assets\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines, which are presented in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce are subject to regulation. The rates are established primarily through the FERC’s ratemaking process, but we also may negotiate rates with our customers pursuant to the terms of our tariffs and FERC policy.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines transport and store natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including local natural gas distribution companies, public utilities, municipalities, direct industrial users, electric power generators, and natural gas marketers and producers. Most of our interstate natural gas transmission businesses are fully contracted under long-term firm reservation contracts with high credit quality customers. These contracts have various expiration dates and account for the major portion of our regulated businesses. Additionally, we offer storage services and interruptible transportation services under shorter-term agreements. Transco’s and Northwest\n6\nPipeline’s three largest customers in 2022 accounted for approximately 23 percent and 51 percent, respectively, of their total operating revenues.\nGathering, Processing, and Treating Assets\nOur gathering, processing, and treating operations are presented within our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, and West reporting segments as described under the heading “Business Segments.”\nOur gathering systems receive natural gas from producers’ crude oil and natural gas wells and gather these volumes to gas processing, treating, or redelivery facilities. Typically, natural gas, in its raw form, is not acceptable for transportation in major interstate natural gas pipelines or for commercial use as a fuel. Our treating facilities remove water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants, and collect condensate. We are generally paid a fee based on the volume of\nnatural gas gathered and/or treated, generally measured in the Btu heating value.\nIn addition, natural gas contains various amounts of NGLs, which generally have a higher value when separated from the natural gas stream. Our processing plants extract the NGLs, which include ethane, primarily used in the petrochemical industry; propane, used for heating, fuel, and also in the petrochemical industry; and, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, primarily used by the refining industry.\nOur gas processing services generate revenues primarily from the following types of contracts:\n•\nFee-based: We are paid a fee based on the volume of natural gas processed, generally measured in the Btu heating value. A portion of our fee-based processing revenue includes a share of the margins on the NGLs produced. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90 percent of our NGL production volumes were under fee-based contracts.\n•\nNoncash commodity-based: We also process gas under two types of commodity-based contracts, keep-whole and percent-of-liquids, where we receive consideration for our services in the form of NGLs. For a keep-whole arrangement we replace the Btu content of the retained NGLs with natural gas purchases, also known as shrink replacement gas. For a percent-of-liquids arrangement, we deliver an agreed-upon percentage of the extracted NGLs and retain the remainder. Retained NGLs are referred to as our equity NGL production. Per-unit NGL margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes at the processing plants. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 10 percent of our NGL production volumes were under noncash commodity-based contracts.\nGenerally, our gathering and processing agreements are long-term agreements, with terms ranging from month-to-month to the life of the producing lease. Certain contracts include cost of service mechanisms that are designed to support a return on invested capital and allow our gathering rates to be adjusted, subject to specified caps in certain cases, to account for variability in volume, capital expenditures, commodity price fluctuations, compression, and other expenses. We also have certain gas gathering and processing agreements with MVC, whereby the customer is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based on any shortfall between the actual gathered and processed volumes and the MVC for a stated period.\nDemand for gas gathering and processing services is dependent on producers’ drilling activities, which is impacted by the strength of the economy, commodity prices, and the resulting demand for natural gas by manufacturing and industrial companies and consumers. Our gathering, processing, and treating businesses do not have direct exposure to crude oil prices. Our on-shore natural gas gathering and processing businesses are substantially focused on gas-directed drilling basins rather than crude oil, with a broad diversity of basins and customers served. Declines in crude oil drilling would be expected to result in less associated natural gas production, which could drive more demand for natural gas produced from gas-directed basins we serve.\nDuring 2022, our facilities gathered and processed gas and crude oil for approximately 240 customers. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 70 percent of our gathering and processing fee revenues and NGL margins from our noncash commodity-based agreements. We believe counterparty credit concerns in our gathering and processing businesses are significantly mitigated by the physical nature of our services, where we gather at the wellhead and are therefore critical to a producer’s ability to move product to market.\n7\nGas and NGL Marketing\nOur NGL and natural gas marketing services are presented primarily within our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment. We market natural gas and NGL products to a wide range of users in the energy and petrochemical industries. In 2022, our three largest natural gas marketing customers accounted for approximately 12 percent of our gross natural gas marketing sales, and our three largest NGL marketing customers accounted for approximately 42 percent of our NGL marketing sales.\nOur gas marketing business markets natural gas from the production at our upstream properties and provides asset management and the wholesale marketing, trading, storage, and transportation of natural gas for a diverse set of natural gas and electric utilities, municipalities, power generators, and producers, and moves gas to markets through transportation and storage agreements on strategically positioned assets. Our pipeline agreements connect with multiple pipelines that provide our customers with access to diverse sources of supply and various natural gas markets. The southeastern market served by our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment is the fastest growing natural gas demand region in the United States and expands our natural gas marketing activities, as well as optimizes our pipeline and storage capabilities.\nWe purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price paid to buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than an estimated, forward market price that can be received in the future, resulting in positive net product sales. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures contracts and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are used to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the stored natural gas is sold. Additionally, we enter into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve our customers and various markets. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures contracts and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity in order to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between receipt and delivery points occurs.\nMonthly demand charges incurred for the contracted storage and transportation capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements are substantially indirectly reimbursed by our customers. As we are acting as an agent, our natural gas marketing revenues are presented net of the related costs of those activities. In addition, all of our natural gas marketing derivative activities qualify as held for trading purposes, which requires net presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Prior to the integration in 2022 of our historical gas marketing business with the acquired Sequent gas marketing business, natural gas marketing revenues and costs for our historical business were reported on a gross basis. Following the integration in 2022, the entire natural gas marketing portfolio is considered held for trading purposes, and the related revenues are therefore presented net of the related costs of those activities in 2022.\nOur NGL marketing business transports and markets our equity NGLs from the production at our processing plants, NGLs from the production at our upstream properties, and also NGLs on behalf of third-party NGL producers, including some of our fee-based processing customers, as well as the NGL volumes owned by RMM and Discovery. The NGL marketing business bears the risk of price changes in these NGL volumes while they are being transported to final sales delivery points. In order to meet sales contract obligations, we may purchase products in the spot market for resale.\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk. To manage this volatility, we use various contracts in our marketing and trading activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. We enter into commodity-related derivatives to hedge exposures to natural gas and NGLs and retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio as well as upstream related production. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying production or transportation and storage contracts, which is not recognized until the underlying transaction occurs.\n8\nCrude Oil Transportation and Production Handling Assets\nOur crude oil transportation operations, which are primarily presented in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” earn revenues primarily from a combination of fixed-monthly fees, contractual fixed or variable fees applied to production volumes, and contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) arrangements. Generally, fixed-monthly fees associated with production handling and export revenues are recognized on a units-of-production basis utilizing either contractually determined maximum daily quantities or expected remaining production. CIAC arrangements are recognized based on a units of production basis, utilizing expected remaining production. Our crude oil transportation business is supported mostly by major oil producers with long-cycle perspectives.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nConsistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources, our operations are conducted, managed, and presented in Part I of this Annual Report within the following reportable segments: Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, West, and Gas & NGL Marketing Services.

These properties were conveyed to a venture in the third quarter of 2021 along with certain oil and gas properties conveyed by a third-party operator in the region. Under the terms of the agreement, the third party owns a 25 percent and we own a 75 percent undivided interest in each well’s working interest. We will retain ownership in the undeveloped acreage until certain acreage earning hurdles are met, at which time the third party will receive an additional 25 percent of any new wells and 50 percent of the remaining undeveloped acreage resulting in the third party owning 50 percent and us owning 50 percent. The combined properties consist of over 1.2 million net acres and an interest in over 3,500 wells.\nCertain natural gas properties in Louisiana were transferred to us in November 2020 as part of a bankruptcy resolution with one of our customers. In the third quarter of 2021, we sold 50 percent of the existing wells and wellbore rights in the South Mansfield area of the Haynesville Shale region to a third party operator, in a strategic effort to develop the acreage, thereby enhancing the value of our midstream natural gas infrastructure. Under the agreement, the third party operates the upstream position and develops the undeveloped acreage. When a certain drilling hurdle is met, the third party’s interest in new wells increases to 75 percent. The third party met this drilling hurdle in early 2023. We retain ownership in the undeveloped acreage until a separate acreage earning hurdle is met, at which time remaining undeveloped acreage will be conveyed to the third party resulting in the third party owning 75 percent and us owning 25 percent.\nOperating Statistics\nNew Energy Ventures\nOur Other segment also includes investments in new energy ventures related to hydrogen, solar, renewable natural gas, and NextGen Gas. NextGen Gas is natural gas that has been independently certified as low emissions gas across all segments of the value chain.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nFERC\nOur gas pipeline interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, accounting, and the extension, enlargement, or abandonment of our jurisdictional facilities, among other things, are subject to regulation. Each of our gas pipeline companies holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines, facilities, and properties for which certificates are required under the NGA. FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate pipelines communicate and conduct transmission transactions with an affiliate that engages in marketing functions. Among other things, the Standards of Conduct require that interstate gas pipelines treat all transmission customers, affiliated and non-affiliated, on a not unduly discriminatory basis.\n18\nFERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and approved by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. Our interstate gas pipeline companies establish rates through the FERC’s ratemaking process. In addition, our interstate gas pipelines may enter into negotiated rate agreements where cost-based recourse rates are made available. Key determinants in the FERC ratemaking process include:\n•\nCosts of providing service, including depreciation expense;\n•\nAllowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes;\n•\nContract and volume throughput assumptions.\nThe allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate design and the allocation of costs between the reservation and commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be subject to refund.\nWe also own interests in and operate natural gas liquids pipelines that are regulated by various federal and state governmental agencies. Services provided on our interstate natural gas liquids pipelines are subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act by the FERC, which has authority over the terms and conditions of service; rates, including depreciation and amortization policies; and initiation of service. Our intrastate natural gas liquids pipelines providing common carrier service are subject to regulation by various state regulatory agencies.\nUpdated Certificate Policy Statement and Interim Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Policy Statement\nOn February 18, 2022, the FERC issued two policy statements providing guidance for its pending and future consideration of interstate natural gas pipeline projects. The first policy statement is an Updated Certificate Policy Statement, which provides an analytical framework for how the FERC will consider whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity and explains that the FERC will consider all impacts of a proposed project, including economic and environmental impacts, together. The second policy statement is an Interim GHG Policy Statement, which sets forth how the FERC will assess the impacts of natural gas infrastructure projects on climate change in its reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act and the NGA. The FERC sought comment on all aspects of the policy statements, including the approach to assessing the significance of the proposed project’s contribution to climate change. On March 24, 2022, the FERC issued an order converting the Updated Certificate Policy Statement and the Interim GHG Policy Statement into draft policy statements and announcing that it will not apply either policy statement to pending applications or applications filed before the FERC issues any final guidance on the policy statements. The FERC has not yet issued final guidance on the policy statements.\nPipeline Safety\nOur gas pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Jobs Creation Act of 2011, and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 and 2020, which regulate safety requirements in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. The United States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) administers federal pipeline safety laws.\nFederal pipeline safety laws authorize PHMSA to establish minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities and persons engaged in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquids by pipeline. These safety standards apply to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce. PHMSA has also established reporting requirements for operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities, as well as provisions for establishing the qualification of pipeline personnel and requirements for managing the integrity of gas transmission and distribution lines and certain hazardous liquid pipelines. To ensure compliance with these provisions, PHMSA performs pipeline safety inspections and has the authority to initiate enforcement actions.\n19\nIn October 2019, PHMSA published the first of three rules that would be a part of the Mega Rule. The Mega Rule was more than 10 years in the making and since October 2019, PHMSA has also published Rules 2 and 3 as a part of the Mega Rule implementation. At the end of 2021, PHMSA published Rule 3 of the Mega Rule with an implementation date in May 2022. Rule 3 was also called The Gas Gathering Rule and expanded Federal Pipeline Safety oversight to more than 400,000 miles of pipeline across all operators, including approximately 5,400 miles and 4,500 miles of our regulated and unregulated pipelines, respectively. The rule established Federal pipeline safety oversight on previously unregulated gas gathering pipelines. The rule limits the use of “incidental gathering pipelines” to 10 miles in length or less. The rule also creates a new category of regulated gas gathering pipelines that are located in rural locations and will be subject to certain reporting and safety standards. New regulations in Rule 3 include requirements for public awareness, emergency response, damage prevention, incident notification, and annual reporting. As a result of the rule, we revised numerous procedures and are now reporting based on the expanded scope as required by regulation.\nIn August 2022, PHMSA published Rule 2, which is the last in the three part Mega Rule set of regulations. Certain portions of Rule 2 go into effect in May 2023 with the remaining portions taking effect in February 2024. Rule 2 contains new corrosion control requirements, new requirements for repair criteria outside of high consequence areas (HCAs), inspections to be performed after extreme weather events or natural disasters, management of change, and other integrity management related rule changes. We are evaluating procedures that will need to be updated to maintain compliance and are also analyzing anticipated cost impacts.\nPHMSA’s new rule, Requirement of Valve Installation and Minimum Rupture Detection Standards, went into effect in October 2022. The rupture monitoring and emergency response standards are applicable to existing pipelines, but the installation of rupture mitigation valves (RMVs) is not retroactive and only applies to new pipelines and significant pipeline replacements. This new rule establishes criteria for how operators must monitor and respond to potential ruptures on their system. It also outlines requirements for the installation of RMVs or Alternative Equivalent Technology to allow for quicker isolation after an incident has occurred. In response to the new regulation, Williams has updated all applicable procedures and is developing implementation plans as a result of the rulemaking.\nPipeline Integrity Regulations\nWe have an enterprise-wide Gas Integrity Management Plan that meets the PHMSA final rule that was issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The rules require gas pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for pipelines that could affect HCAs in the event of pipeline failure. The integrity management program includes a baseline assessment plan along with periodic reassessments to be completed within required time frames. In meeting the integrity regulations, we have identified HCAs and developed baseline assessment plans. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments of any new HCAs have been completed. Also, in response to the portion of the Mega Rule implemented in 2021, we have identified Moderate Consequence Areas, and Class 3 and 4 pipeline locations required by the rule and integrated those segments into our integrity program, and have begun scheduling required assessments and reassessments as needed to meet the regulatory timelines.\nWe estimate that the cost to be incurred in 2023 associated with this program to be approximately $126 million. Management considers costs associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, recoverable through Northwest Pipeline’s and Transco’s rates.\nWe have an enterprise-wide Liquid Integrity Management Plan that we believe meets the PHMSA final rule that was issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The rule requires liquid pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for liquid transmission pipelines that could affect HCAs in the event of pipeline failure. The integrity management program includes a baseline assessment plan along with periodic reassessments expected to be completed within required time frames. In meeting the integrity regulations, we utilized government defined HCAs and developed baseline assessment plans. We completed assessments within the required time frames. We estimate that the cost to be incurred in 2023 associated with this program will be approximately $10 million. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments of any new HCAs are expected to be completed within the time frames required by the rule. Management considers the costs associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.\n20\nCybersecurity Matters\nThe  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  issued  Security  Directive  Pipeline-2021-01B  (Security Directive 1B) on May 29, 2022, which requires that owners/operators of critical pipelines (1) report cybersecurity incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) within 24 hours; (2) appoint a cybersecurity coordinator to coordinate with TSA and CISA; and (3) conduct a self-assessment of cybersecurity practices, identify any gaps, and develop a plan and timeline for remediation. On July 27, 2022, the TSA issued Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02C (Security Directive 2C), which requires owners/operators of critical pipelines to (1) establish and implement a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan that describes the specific cybersecurity measures employed and the schedule for achieving the cybersecurity outcomes described in Security Directive 2C; (2) develop and maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan to reduce the risk of operational disruption or other significant impacts from a cybersecurity incident; and (3) establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Program and submit an annual plan describing how the effectiveness of cybersecurity measures will be assessed. We have established and received TSA approval for our Cybersecurity Implementation Plan and are compliant with the remaining requirements established in Security Directives 1B and 2C. New regulations or security directives issued by TSA may impose additional requirements applicable to our cybersecurity program, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” —\n“A breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation.”\nState Gathering Regulations\nOur onshore midstream gathering operations are subject to laws and regulations in the various states in which we operate. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate the terms of service for our intrastate natural gas gathering business in Texas. Although the applicable state regulations vary widely, they generally require that pipeline rates and practices be reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and may include provisions covering marketing, pricing, pollution, environment, and human health and safety. Some states, such as New York and Ohio, have specific regulations pertaining to the design, construction, and operations of gathering lines within such state.\nIntrastate Liquids Pipelines in the Gulf Coast\nOur intrastate liquids pipelines in the Gulf Coast are regulated by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, the Texas Railroad Commission, and various other state and federal agencies. These pipelines are also subject to the liquid pipeline safety and integrity regulations discussed above since both Louisiana and Texas have adopted the integrity management regulations defined in PHMSA.\nOCSLA\nOur offshore gas and liquids pipelines located on the outer continental shelf are subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which provides in part that outer continental shelf pipelines “must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner shippers.”\nSee Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” —\n“The operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers,”\nand\n“The natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.\n”\n21\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOur operations are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state, local, and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability for cleanup costs. Materials could be released into the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:\n•\nLeakage from gathering systems, underground gas storage caverns, pipelines, processing or treating facilities, transportation facilities, and storage tanks;\n•\nDamage to facilities resulting from accidents during normal operations;\n•\nDamages to onshore and offshore equipment and facilities resulting from storm events or natural disasters;\n•\nBlowouts, cratering, and explosions.\nIn addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by former owners or operators of our properties.\nWe believe compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or current competitive position. However, environmental laws and regulations could affect our business in various ways from time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses.\nFor additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal, or local regulatory measures on our business and specific environmental issues, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” —\n“Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations,”\nand Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental” and “Environmental Matters” in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 17 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOMPETITION\nGathering and Processing\nCompetition for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, transportation, and storage, as well as NGLs transportation, fractionation, and storage continues to increase as production from shales and other resource areas continues to grow. Our midstream services compete with similar facilities that are in the same proximity as our assets.\nWe face competition from companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including major and independent natural gas midstream providers, private equity firms, and major integrated oil and natural gas companies that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store, and market natural gas and NGLs, as well as some larger exploration and production companies that are choosing to develop midstream services to handle their own natural gas.\nOur gathering and processing agreements are generally long-term agreements that may include acreage dedication. Competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms (products retained or fees charged), array of services provided, efficiency and reliability of services, location of gathering facilities, available capacity, downstream interconnects, and latent capacity. We believe our significant presence in traditional prolific supply basins, our solid positions in growing shale plays, our expertise and reputation as a reliable operator, and our ability to offer integrated packages of services position us well against our competition.\n22\nRegulated Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage\nThe market for supplying natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines, storage facilities, and other related services are expanding to service the growing demand for natural gas. Additionally, pipeline capacity in many growing natural gas supply basins is constrained causing competition to increase among pipeline companies as they strive to connect those basins to major natural gas demand centers.\nIn our business, we predominately compete with major intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. In the last few years, local distribution companies have also started entering into the long-haul transportation business through joint venture pipelines.\nThe principle elements of competition in the interstate natural gas pipeline business are based on capacity available, rates, reliability, quality of customer service, diversity of supply, and proximity to customers and market hubs.\nWe face competition in a number of our key markets and we compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines for deliveries to customers who can take deliveries at multiple points. Natural gas delivered on our system competes with alternative energy sources used to generate electricity such as hydroelectric power, coal, fuel oil, and nuclear. Future demand for natural gas within the power sector could be increased by regulations limiting or discouraging coal use or could be adversely affected by laws mandating or encouraging renewable power sources.\nSignificant entrance barriers to build new pipelines exist, including federal and growing state regulations and public opposition against new pipeline builds, and these factors will continue to impact potential competition for the foreseeable future. However, we believe our past success in working with regulators and the public, the position of our existing infrastructure, established strategic long-term contracts, and the fact that our pipelines have numerous receipt and delivery points along our systems provide us a competitive advantage, especially along the eastern seaboard and northwestern United States.\nEnergy Management and Marketing Services\nOur Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment competes with national and regional full-service energy providers, producers, and pipelines marketing affiliates or other marketing companies that aggregate commodities with transportation and storage capacity.\nFor additional information regarding competition for our services or otherwise affecting our business, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” - “\nThe financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve,”\n“\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results\n,” and “\nWe may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.\n”\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are committed to maintaining a work environment that enables us to attract, develop, and retain a highly skilled and diverse group of talented employees who help promote long-term value creation.\nEmployees\nAs of February 1, 2023, we had 5,043 full-time employees located throughout the United States. Of this total, approximately 22 percent are women and 17 percent are ethnically diverse. During 2022, our voluntary turnover rate was 7.7 percent.\nWe encourage you to review our 2021 Sustainability Report available on our website for more information about our human capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n23\nWorkforce Safety\nWe continue to advance our safety-first culture by developing and empowering our employees to operate our assets in a safe, reliable, and customer-focused way.\nWe strive to continuously improve safety and work towards zero safety incidents. When a safety hazard is recognized, every employee is empowered to stop work activities, make changes to enhance safety, and share the lessons learned with the organization on how we made it right.\nFor 2021, safety and environmental-focused goals and related metrics comprised 10 percent of our annual incentive program for employees, and included our Loss of Primary Containment Events Reduction and High Potential Near Miss to Incident Ratio.\nFor 2022, these goals included our Loss of Primary Containment Events Reduction, a new Behavioral Near Miss to Incident Ratio goal aimed to focus attention on behaviors that are the leading causes of incidents, as well as a new Methane Emissions Reduction goal focusing on our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These three metrics comprise 15 percent of our annual incentive program for employees, and reinforce the importance of incident prevention and our commitment to environmental and safety-focused improvements.\nFor 2022, our Behavioral Near Miss to Incident Ratio and Methane Emissions Reduction goals outperformed the established targets, and while Loss of Primary Containment Events were reduced, they fell short of the overall reduction target.\nWorkforce Health, Engagement, and Development\nOur employees are our most valued resource, are instrumental in our mission to safely deliver products that fuel the clean energy economy, and are the driving force behind our reputation as a safe, reliable company that does the right thing, every time. Cultivating a healthy work environment increases productivity and promotes long-term value creation.\nWe provide a comprehensive total rewards program that includes base salary, an all-employee annual incentive program, retirement benefits, and health benefits, including wellness and employee assistance programs. We provide employees with company-paid life insurance, disability coverage, and paid parental leave for both birth and non-birth parents, as well as adoption assistance. Our annual incentive program is a key component of our commitment to a performance culture focused on recognizing and rewarding high performance.\nIn order to attract and retain top talent, we create and are committed to maintaining a safe, inclusive workplace where employees feel valued, heard, respected, and supported in their personal and professional development. Our Employee Development Council is a cross-functional, cross-enterprise advisory board that works to understand the needs of the business by providing input on, and advocating for, employee development initiatives. Additionally, we support strong employee engagement by encouraging open dialogue regarding professional development and succession planning.\nWe offer robust corporate and technical training programs to support the professional development of our employees and add long-term value to our business. Our Learning and Training Council defines and maintains an agile governance structure that ensures training plans are effective and aligned to business needs and employee development. Performance is measured considering both the achieved results associated with attaining annual goals and observable skills and behaviors based on our defined competencies that contribute to workplace effectiveness and career success. Including the defined competencies in our annual performance program illustrates our emphasis on, and commitment to, achieving results in the right way.\nAdditionally, we are committed to strengthening the communities where we operate through philanthropic giving and volunteerism. We support Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math education initiatives, environmental conservation and first responder efforts, and the work of United Way agencies across the United States.\n24\nThe Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the establishment and administration of our compensation programs, including incentive compensation and equity-based plans, as well as the oversight of human capital management, including diversity and inclusion, and development.\nDiversity & Inclusion\nWe are committed to creating an inclusive culture, where differences are embraced and employees feel valued, welcomed, appreciated, and compelled to reach their full potential. We believe that inclusion fosters innovation, collaboration, and drives business growth and long-term success. To create a culture of inclusion, we embrace, appreciate, and fully leverage the diversity within our teams, including gender, race and ethnicity, life experiences, thoughts, perspectives, and anything that makes us different from one another. We believe that incorporating our many differences into a team of people who are working toward the same goal gives us a competitive advantage.\nTo create space for employees to share personal experiences and perspectives, and to appreciate and celebrate what makes people different, we offer Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These groups are employee-led and based on similar interests and experiences, represent diverse communities and their allies, and are open to everyone. ERG members participate in community events, volunteer, lend professional and personal support to one another, and promote inclusion across the company. They also provide input to the leadership team.\nWe are committed to helping all employees develop and succeed. We strive for diverse representation at all levels of the organization through our talent management practices and employee development programs, including required baseline diversity and inclusion training for all leaders across the company. Diversity metrics are reported monthly to our management team to enhance transparency and opportunities for improvement.\nOur Diversity and Inclusion Council, which includes members of the executive officer team, organizational and operational leaders, and individual employees, promotes policies, practices, and procedures that support the growth of a high-performing workforce where all individuals can achieve their full potential. The council serves as the governing body over enterprise diversity and inclusion initiatives, including a quarterly candid conversation meeting for all employees, 10 active ERGs, and annual awards that recognize an outstanding leader and an individual contributor who champion inclusion.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our Board of Directors includes 12 members, 11 of whom are independent members, and one-quarter of which are women. As part of the director selection and nominating process, the Governance and Sustainability Committee annually assesses the Board’s diversity in areas such as geography, gender, race and ethnicity, and age. We strive to maintain a board of directors with diverse occupational and personal backgrounds.\nWEBSITE ACCESS TO REPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION\nWe file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and other documents electronically with the SEC under the Exchange Act.\nOur Internet website is www.williams.com\n.\nWe make available, free of charge, through the Investors tab of our Internet website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8‑K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

    "text": "FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nFOR PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF\nTHE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThe reports, filings, and other public announcements of Williams may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. Such statements are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management’s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcomes of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters. We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nAll statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe, or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “seeks,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “continues,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “might,” “goals,” “objectives,” “targets,” “planned,” “potential,” “projects,” “scheduled,” “will,” “assumes,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “in-service date,” or other similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding:\n•\nLevels of dividends to Williams stockholders;\n•\nFuture credit ratings of Williams and its affiliates;\n•\nAmounts and nature of future capital expenditures;\n•\nExpansion and growth of our business and operations;\n•\nExpected in-service dates for capital projects;\n•\nFinancial condition and liquidity;\n•\nBusiness strategy;\n•\nCash flow from operations or results of operations;\n•\nSeasonality of certain business components;\n•\nNatural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil prices, supply, and demand;\n•\nDemand for our services.\nForward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n•\nAvailability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices;\n•\nDevelopment and rate of adoption of alternative energy sources;\n•\nThe impact of existing and future laws and regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental matters, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals, and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes;\n•\nOur exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;\n26\n•\nOur ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into existing businesses as well as successfully expand our facilities and consummate asset sales on acceptable terms;\n•\nWhether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and investment opportunities;\n•\nThe strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition;\n•\nThe amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate;\n•\nWhether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan;\n•\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social, and governance practices;\n•\nThe physical and financial risks associated with climate change;\n•\nThe impacts of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions;\n•\nThe risks resulting from outbreaks or other public health crises, including COVID-19;\n•\nRisks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities;\n•\nActs of terrorism, cybersecurity incidents, and related disruptions;\n•\nOur costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;\n•\nChanges in maintenance and construction costs, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient construction- related inputs, including skilled labor;\n•\nInflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers);\n•\nRisks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital;\n•\nThe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls and the impact on domestic production;\n•\nChanges in the current geopolitical situation, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine;\n•\nChanges in U.S. governmental administration and policies;\n•\nWhether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends;\n•\nAdditional risks described in our filings with the SEC.\nGiven the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligations to, and do not intend to, update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.\nIn addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.\nBecause forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors are described in the following section.\n27\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases our reputation. The occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production predominantly by third parties in our supply basins. Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. We do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. Accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. In addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including permitting and environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital have, and may continue to, adversely affect the development and production of existing or additional natural gas reserves and the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities. The import and export of natural gas supplies may also be affected by such conditions. Low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. The competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. A failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities.\nDemand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. Alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, as well as technological advances and renewable sources of energy, could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business. Governmentally imposed constraints, such as prohibitions on natural gas hookups in newly constructed buildings, could also artificially limit new demand for natural gas.\nA failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPrices for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain or grow our businesses.\nOur revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, NGLs, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of low commodity prices, or a decline in commodity prices. Price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. Prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. Price volatility has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe markets for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including:\n•\nImbalances in supply and demand whether rising from worldwide or domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and related commodities;\n28\n•\nGeopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and other producing regions;\n•\nThe activities of OPEC and other countries, whether acting independently of or informally aligned with OPEC, which have significant oil, natural gas or other commodity production capabilities, including Russia;\n•\nThe level of consumer demand;\n•\nThe price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks;\n•\nThe availability of pipeline capacity;\n•\nSupply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions;\n•\nThe price and quantity of foreign imports and domestic exports of natural gas and oil;\n•\nDomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n•\nThe credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns, or are dependent upon us, in some cases without a readily available alternative, to provide necessary services. However, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. Our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. In a low commodity price environment, certain of our customers have been or could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress resulting, in some cases, in a customer bankruptcy filing or an effort to renegotiate our contracts. To the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with such customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or, if we so agree, may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection, or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups.\nWe have experienced, and we anticipate that we will continue to face, opposition to the operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups, and other advocates. In some instances, we encounter opposition that disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. Opposition to our operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay or denial of required governmental permits, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt, or delay the operation or expansion of our assets and business. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property, or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Any such event that delays or prevents the expansion of our business, that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make\n29\nsignificant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. We have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. These are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. We may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. Regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates or assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate or assets, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. If we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner.\nOur growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing, or treating pipelines and facilities, NGL transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. Additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, permits, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns, including due to inflation, could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. Additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that:\n•\nChanging circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes that are materially different than anticipated;\n•\nWe could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets, and we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate;\n•\nAcquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations, and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures;\n•\nAcquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access credit or capital markets or obtain acceptable terms.\nIf realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows.\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. Any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, NGLs, or other commodities into the areas that we operate could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities, or other factors. In addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. Failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe do not own 100 percent of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including the Nonconsolidated Entities, which may limit our ability to operate and control these subsidiaries. Certain operations, including the Nonconsolidated Entities, are conducted through arrangements that may limit our ability to operate and control these operations.\nThe operations of our current non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Nonconsolidated Entities, are conducted in accordance with their organizational documents. We anticipate that we will enter into more such\n30\narrangements, including through new joint venture structures or new Nonconsolidated Entities. We may have limited operational flexibility in such current and future arrangements, and we may not be able to control the timing or amount of cash distributions received. In certain cases:\n•\nWe cannot control the amount of cash reserves determined to be necessary to operate the business, which reduces cash available for distributions;\n•\nWe cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund and we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures;\n•\nWe may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets;\n•\nWe may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest;\n•\nWe have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations;\n•\nWe may have additional obligations, such as required capital contributions, that are important to the success of the operations.\nIn addition, conflicts of interest may arise between us, on the one hand, and other interest owners, on the other hand. If such conflicts of interest arise, we may not have the ability to control the outcome with respect to the matter in question. Disputes between us and other interest owners may also result in delays, litigation, or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue such arrangements could adversely affect our ability to conduct the operations that are the subject of such arrangements which could, in turn, negatively affect our business, growth strategy, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and NGLs. Although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. Our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n•\nThe level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy;\n•\nNatural gas and NGL prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. Higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. Also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems;\n•\nGeneral economic, financial markets, and industry conditions;\n•\nThe effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices;\n•\nOur ability to understand our customers’ expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services, and effectively manage customer relationships. The results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market.\n31\nCertain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.\nOur gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. It is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. Although other services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.\nSome of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers.\nSome of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. If a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. If our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nFailure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\nCertain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the United States. Services provided pursuant to these arrangements  could be disrupted. Similarly, the expiration of agreements associated with such arrangements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. Our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAn impairment of our assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings.\nGAAP requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. The outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments. Additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. Investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus and activism related to ESG (as proponents or opponents) and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage, and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face pressures from our stockholders, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint, and promote sustainability. Our stockholders may require us to implement ESG procedures or standards in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us or before they may make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our\n32\nESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. We adopted certain practices as highlighted in our 2021 Sustainability Report, including with respect to air emissions, biodiversity and land use, climate change, and environmental stewardship. It is possible, however, that our stockholders might not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. If we do not meet our stockholders’ expectations, our business, ability to access capital, and/or our stock price could be harmed.\nAdditionally, adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry related to the worldwide social and political environments, including uncertainty or instability resulting from climate change, changes in political leadership and environmental policies, changes in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and renewable energy, concern about the environmental impact of climate change, and investors’ expectations regarding ESG matters, may also adversely affect demand for our services. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on our business.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the price of our stock and our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.\nThe threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to our business. Energy needs vary with weather conditions. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks.\nAdditionally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. These climate-related changes could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Climate change and GHG regulation could also reduce demand for our services. Our business could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against GHG emitters, based on links drawn between GHG emissions and climate change.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions.\nThere are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of NGLs, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including:\n•\nAging infrastructure and mechanical problems;\n•\nDamages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions;\n•\nUncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs, crude oil, or other products;\n•\nCollapse or failure of storage caverns;\n•\nOperator error;\n•\nDamage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;\n•\nPollution and other environmental risks;\n•\nFires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts;\n33\n•\nSecurity risks, including cybersecurity;\n•\nOperating in a marine environment.\nAny of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. The location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. An event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.\nOur assets and operations, as well as our customers’ assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.\nOur assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers’ assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. A significant disruption in our or our customers’ operations or the occurrence of a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and related disruptions.\nGiven the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. Uncertainty surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or other sustained military campaigns, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terrorism. A terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, NGLs, or other commodities. Acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. Our Board of Directors has oversight\nresponsibility with regard to assessment of the major risks inherent in our business, including cybersecurity risks, and reviews management’s efforts to address and mitigate such risks, including the establishment and implementation of policies to address cybersecurity threats. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower, and capital in our information technology infrastructure. However, the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. While we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we regularly face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. We face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, “hacktivists”, or private individuals. We face the threat of theft and misuse of sensitive data and information, including customer and employee information. We also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. We also are subject to cybersecurity risks arising from the fact that our business operations are interconnected with third parties, including third-party pipelines, other facilities and our contractors and vendors. In addition, the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process, and report financial information. Breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical\n34\nfacilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, which may increase as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, could result in damage to or destruction of our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, the loss of contracts, the imposition of significant costs associated with remediation and litigation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, increased insurance costs, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store, or deliver natural gas or NGL products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed NGLs, thereby reducing our revenues. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnection or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nRevenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. As such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. In those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our facilities and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. In addition, some of our facilities cross Native American lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. We may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by Native American tribes. Our loss of any of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism.\nIn recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including ours. We were the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in our incurring significant costs. If stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the Company or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, or operations of the Company, we could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control.\nWe have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest\n35\nrates, and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nA downgrade of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business.\nDowngrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. In addition, our ability to access capital markets could be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings.\nCredit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. As of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned an investment-grade credit rating by the credit ratings agencies.\nDifficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in the global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and the actions undertaken by western nations in response to Russia’s actions has had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on global financial markets. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over U.S. fiscal and monetary policies. These concerns, as well as actions taken by the U.S. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and U.S. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above.\nRestrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility.\nOur total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of December 31, 2022, was $22.6 billion.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our, and our material subsidiaries’, ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. Certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply.\nOur debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n•\nMake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;\n•\nImpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;\n•\nDiminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally;\n36\n•\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;\n•\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.\nOur ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. In addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. For more information regarding our debt agreements, please read Note 12 – Debt and Banking Arrangements\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges to interest rates or increases in interest rates could adversely impact our access to credit, share price, our ability to issue securities or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels.\nInterest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. The dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels.\nOur hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.\nIn an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. In these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. The difference in accounting treatment for the underlying position and the financial instrument used to hedge the value of the contract can cause volatility in our reported net income while the positions are open due to mark-to-market accounting.\nOur and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ policies concerning fossil- fuel related businesses\n.\nPublic concern regarding the potential effects of climate change have directed increased attention towards the funding sources of fossil-fuel energy companies. As a result, certain financial institutions, funds, and other sources of capital have restricted or eliminated their investment in certain market segments of fossil-fuel related energy.  Ultimately, limiting fossil-fuel related companies’ access to capital could make it more difficult for our customers to\n37\nsecure funding for exploration and production activities or for us to secure funding for growth projects.  Such a lack of capital could also both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nThe operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers.\nPublic and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. Both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations.\nCertain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. Adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.\nIn addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner that differs from prior regulatory action. New laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. The change in the U.S. governmental administration and its policies may increase the likelihood of such legal and regulatory developments. If new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.\nIn addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the FERC. Federal regulation extends to such matters as:\n•\nTransportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce;\n•\nRates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service;\n•\nCertification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;\n•\nAcquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;\n•\nAccounts and records;\n•\nDepreciation and amortization policies;\n•\nRelationships with affiliated companies that are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business;\n•\nMarket manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas.\n38\nRegulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. Substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of NGLs, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. New or amended environmental laws and regulations can also result in significant increases in capital costs we incur to comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits.\nJoint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under, or from our properties and facilities. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours.\nWe are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest, or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.\nIn addition, climate change regulations and the costs that may be associated with such regulations and with the regulation of emissions of GHGs have the potential to affect our business. Regulatory actions by the Environmental Protection Agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, or administer and manage any GHG emissions program.  We believe it is possible that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit GHG emissions associated with our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions. We could also be subjected to a carbon tax assessed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions or otherwise. However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations might take, the stringency of any such regulations or when they might become effective. Several legislative bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. Previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of GHGs that can be emitted (so called “caps”) together with systems of permitted emissions allowances. These proposals could require us to reduce emissions or to purchase allowances for such emissions.\nIn addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of GHG emissions sooner than and/or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted. Future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce GHG emissions could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate.  We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area and otherwise take efforts to limit and reduce GHG emissions from our\n39\nfacilities. Although the regulation of GHG emissions may have a material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.\nIf we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims.\nIn accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact our results of operations.\nEvents such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the challenges of attracting new, qualified workers to the midstream energy industry, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, including members of senior management, results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends.\nWe may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. The actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n•\nThe amount of cash that our subsidiaries distribute to us;\n•\nThe amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow;\n•\nThe restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements;\n•\nThe cost of acquisitions, if any.\nA failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price."

    "text": "General\nWe are an energy company committed to being the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. Our operations are located in the United States.\nOur interstate natural gas pipeline strategy is to create value by maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing high-quality, low-cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets. Our gas pipeline businesses’ interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. The rates are established primarily through the FERC’s ratemaking process, but we also may negotiate rates with our customers pursuant to the terms of our tariffs and FERC policy. Changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.\nThe ongoing strategy of our midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers. These services include natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression, and storage, NGL fractionation, transportation and storage, crude oil production handling and transportation, as well as marketing services for NGL, crude oil, and natural gas.\nOur operations are conducted, managed, and presented within the following reportable segments: Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, West, and Gas & NGL Marketing Services, consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources. All remaining business activities, including our upstream operations and corporate activities, are included in Other. Our reportable segments are comprised of the following business activities:\n•\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipelines, Transco and Northwest Pipeline, and their related natural gas storage facilities, as well as natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated variable interest entity, or VIE), a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery. Transmission & Gulf of Mexico also includes natural gas storage facilities and pipelines providing services in north Texas.\n•\nNortheast G&P is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 65 percent interest in our Northeast JV (a consolidated VIE) which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a 66 percent interest in Cardinal (a consolidated VIE) which operates in Ohio, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Blue Racer, and Appalachia Midstream Investments.\n•\nWest is comprised of our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of east Texas and northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko and Permian basins. This segment also includes our NGL storage facilities, an undivided 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, a 50 percent equity-method investment in OPPL, a 50 percent equity-method investment in RMM, a 20 percent equity-method investment in Targa Train 7, and a 15 percent equity-method investment in Brazos Permian II.\n•\nGas & NGL Marketing Services is comprised of our NGL and natural gas marketing and trading operations which includes risk management and transactions related to the storage and transportation of natural gas and NGLs on strategically positioned assets.\n46\nUnless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nDividends\nIn December 2022, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $0.425 per share. On January 31, 2023, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.4475 per share payable on March 27, 2023.\nOverview of the Results of Operations\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by $532 million over the prior year. Further discussion of our results is found in this report in the Results of Operations.\nRecent Developments\nMountainWest Acquisition\nOn February 14, 2023, we closed on the acquisition of 100 percent of MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company (MountainWest) which includes FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and natural gas storage capacity, for $1.08 billion of cash and assumption of $430 million outstanding principal amount of long-term debt, subject to working capital and post-closing adjustments. The MountainWest Acquisition expands our existing transmission and storage infrastructure footprint into major markets in Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado.\nNorthwest Pipeline FERC Rate Case Settlement\nOn November 15, 2022, Northwest Pipeline received approval from the FERC for a stipulation and settlement agreement which generally reduces rates effective January 1, 2023, resolves other rate issues, establishes a Modernization and Emission Reduction Program, and satisfies its rate case filing obligation. Provisions were included in the settlement that establishes a moratorium on any proceedings that would seek to place new rates in effect any earlier than January 1, 2026, and that a general rate case filing will be made for rates to become effective not later than April 1, 2028, unless we have entered into a pre-filing settlement prior to that date.\nNorTex Asset Purchase\nOn August 31, 2022, we purchased a group of assets in north Texas, primarily natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, from NorTex Midstream Holdings, LLC for $424 million.\nTrace Acquisition\nOn April 29, 2022, we closed on the acquisition of 100 percent of Gemini Arklatex, LLC through which we acquired the Haynesville Shale region gas gathering and related assets of Trace Midstream for $972 million. The purpose of the Trace Acquisition was to expand our footprint into the east Texas area of the Haynesville Shale region, increasing in-basin scale in one of the largest growth basins in the country.\nCompany Outlook\nOur strategy is to provide a large-scale, reliable, and clean energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the United States. We accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. We continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship including seeking opportunities for renewable energy ventures, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. We believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe, reliable, clean energy services to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders. Our business plan for 2023 includes a continued focus on earnings and cash flow growth.\n47\nIn 2023, our operating results are expected to benefit from the MountainWest Acquisition, volume growth in the Haynesville and Northeast G&P areas, and annual inflation-based rate increases across our gathering and processing business. We also anticipate increases resulting from the development of our upstream oil and gas properties and a full year of contribution from recently acquired Trace and NorTex assets. These increases are partially offset by a lower expected commodity price environment.\nWe seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of safe, clean, and reliable energy infrastructure assets that continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the United States. Our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2023 are expected to be in a range from $1.40 billion to $1.70 billion, excluding the MountainWest Acquisition. Growth capital spending in 2023 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting the Northeast G&P business and projects supporting growth in the Haynesville basin, including the Louisiana Energy Gateway project. We also expect to invest capital in the development of our upstream oil and gas properties. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, and meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments.\nPotential risks and obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include:\n•\nA global recession, which could result in downturns in financial markets and commodity prices, as well as impact demand for natural gas and related products;\n•\nOpposition to, and regulations affecting, our infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay or denial in permits and approvals needed for our projects;\n•\nCounterparty credit and performance risk;\n•\nUnexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution, including increases from inflation or delays caused by supply chain disruptions;\n•\nUnexpected changes in customer drilling and production activities, which could negatively impact gathering and processing volumes;\n•\nLower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower-than-expected volumes, energy commodity prices, and margins;\n•\nGeneral economic, financial markets, or industry downturns, including increased inflation and interest rates;\n•\nPhysical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by weather-related events;\n•\nOther risks set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.\nExpansion Projects\nOur ongoing major expansion projects include the following:\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico\nDeepwater Shenandoah Project\nIn June 2021, we reached an agreement with two third-parties to provide offshore natural gas gathering and transportation services as well as onshore natural gas processing services. The project expands our existing Gulf of Mexico offshore infrastructure via a 5-mile offshore lateral pipeline from the Shenandoah platform to Discovery’s existing Keathley Canyon Connector pipeline, adds onshore processing facilities at Larose, Louisiana to handle the expected rich Shenandoah production, and the natural gas liquids will be fractionated and marketed at Discovery’s Paradis plant in Louisiana. We plan to place the project into service in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n48\nDeepwater Whale Project\nIn August 2021, we reached an agreement with two third-parties to provide offshore natural gas gathering and crude oil transportation services as well as onshore natural gas processing services. The project expands our existing Western Gulf of Mexico offshore infrastructure via a 26-mile gas lateral pipeline from the Whale platform to the existing Perdido gas pipeline and adds a new 125-mile oil pipeline from the Whale platform to our existing junction platform. We plan to place the project into service in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nRegional Energy Access\nIn January 2023, we received approval from the FERC for the project to expand Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from receipt points in northeastern Pennsylvania to multiple delivery points in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. We plan to place the full project into service as early as the fourth quarter of 2024, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 829 Mdth/d.\nSouthside Reliability Enhancement\nIn May 2022, we filed an application with the FERC for the project, which is an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from receipt points in Virginia and North Carolina to delivery points in North Carolina. We plan to place the project into service as early as the 2024/2025 winter heating season assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 423 Mdth/d.\nTexas to Louisiana Energy Pathway\nIn August 2022, we filed an application with the FERC for the project, which involves an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide firm transportation capacity from receipt points in south Texas to delivery points in Texas and Louisiana. We plan to place the project into service as early as the first quarter of 2025, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to provide 364 Mdth/d of new firm transportation service through a combination of increasing capacity, converting interruptible capacity to firm, and utilizing existing capacity.\nSoutheast Energy Connector\nIn August 2022, we filed an application with the FERC for the project, which is an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from receipt points in Mississippi and Alabama to a delivery point in Alabama. We plan to place the project into service in the first quarter of 2025, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 150 Mdth/d.\nCommonwealth Energy Connector\nIn August 2022, we filed an application with the FERC for the project, which involves an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity in Virginia. We plan to place the project into service as early as the fourth quarter of 2025, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 105 Mdth/d.\nWest\nLouisiana Energy Gateway\nIn June 2022, we announced our intention to construct new natural gas gathering assets which are expected to gather 1.8 Bcf/d of natural gas produced in the Haynesville Shale basin for delivery to premium markets, including Transco, industrial markets, and growing LNG export demand along the Gulf Coast. This project is expected to go into service in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n49\nHaynesville Gathering Expansion\nIn February 2023, we announced our agreement with a third party to facilitate natural gas production growth in the Haynesville basin. We plan to construct a greenfield gathering system in support the third party’s 26,000 acre dedication. The system, once constructed, will provide natural gas gathering services to the third party. The third party has also agreed to a long-term capacity commitment on our Louisiana Energy Gateway project.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPension and Postretirement Obligations\nWe have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that require the use of assumptions and estimates to determine the benefit obligations and costs. These estimates and assumptions involve significant judgement and actual results will likely be different than anticipated. Estimates and assumptions utilized include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, cash balance interest crediting rate, and employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality. These assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as needed. The assumptions utilized to compute the benefit obligations and costs are shown in Note 7 – Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost and obligations resulting from a one-percentage-point change in the specific assumption.\nOur expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on historical returns, forward-looking capital market expectations of at least 10 years from our third-party independent investment advisor, as well as the investment strategy and relative weightings of the asset classes within the investment portfolio. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our pension plans was 3.81 percent in 2022. The 2022 actual return on plan assets for our pension plans was a loss of approximately 9.7 percent. The 10-year average rate of return on pension plan assets through December 2022 was approximately 6.8 percent. The expected rates of return on plan assets are long-term in nature and are not significantly impacted by short-term market performance.\nThe discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans, which considers a yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds and the duration of the expected benefit cash flows of each plan.\n50\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate assumption represents the average long-term rate by which the pension plans’ cash balance accounts are expected to grow. Interest on the cash balance accounts is based on the 30-year U.S. Treasury securities rate.\n51\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Overview\nThe following table and discussion is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2022. The results of operations by segment are discussed in further detail following this consolidated overview discussion.\n_______\n*    + = Favorable change; - = Unfavorable change; NM = A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to a change in signs, a zero-value denominator, or a percentage change greater than 200.\n2022 vs. 2021\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to higher gathering and processing rates driven by favorable commodity prices and annual contractual rate escalations for certain of our West and Northeast G&P operations, higher volumes including from the Trace Acquisition and NorTex Asset Purchase, higher transportation fee revenues associated with the Leidy South expansion project placed fully in service at Transco in December 2021,\n52\nand higher reimbursable electric power costs and storage rates which are substantially offset in\nOperating and maintenance expenses\n.\nService revenues – commodity consideration\nincreased primarily due to higher NGL prices, partially offset by lower NGL volumes. These revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for processing services provided. Most of these NGL volumes are sold during the month processed and therefore are offset within\nProduct costs\nbelow.\nProduct sales\nincreased primarily due to higher marketing sales prices and volumes, including increased volumes associated with the Sequent Acquisition in third-quarter 2021 and the Trace Acquisition in second-quarter 2022.\nProduct sales\nalso increased due to higher sales volumes and prices associated with our upstream operations and system management gas sales, as well as higher prices and lower volumes related to our equity NGL sales activities. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable change in natural gas marketing sales primarily due to the impact of netting the 2022 legacy natural gas marketing revenues with the associated costs (see Note 1 – General, Description of Business, and Basis of Presentation of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As we are acting as agent for natural gas marketing customers of our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment, our natural gas marketing product sales are presented net of the related costs of those activities, including significant 2022 lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to our natural gas inventory.\nThe unfavorable change in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nprimarily reflects higher net unrealized losses in our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment, and higher net realized losses related to derivative contracts in our Other segment. Lower net realized losses at our West segment and a net unrealized gain at our Other segment in 2022 partially offset these impacts. We experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio as well as upstream related production. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying production or transportation and storage contracts, which is not recognized until the underlying transaction occurs.\nProduct costs\ndecreased primarily due to the impact of netting the 2022 legacy natural gas marketing revenues with the associated costs. This decrease was partially offset by higher prices and volumes associated with our NGL marketing activities, including the increase in volumes associated with the Trace Acquisition in second-quarter 2022, as well as significant 2022 lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to our NGL inventory. Product costs also increased due to higher system management gas purchases and higher NGL prices associated with volumes acquired as commodity consideration related to our equity NGL production activities.\nNet processing commodity expenses\ndecreased primarily due to the impact of a 2022 net unrealized gain on derivatives for processing plant shrink gas purchases and lower volumes for natural gas purchases associated with our equity NGL production activities, partially offset by higher net realized prices.\nThe net sum of\nService revenues – commodity consideration\n,\nProduct sales\n,\nProduct costs,\nnet realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives related to sales of product, and net realized processing commodity expenses comprise our\nCommodity margins\n. However,\nProduct sales\nand net realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives at our Other segment reflecting sales related to our oil and gas producing properties comprise\nNet realized product sales\nand are excluded from our\nCommodity margins\n. See Results of Operations— Year-Over-Year Operating Results - Segments for additional discussion of\nCommodity margins\nand\nNet realized product sales\non a segment basis.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs, including $63 million of higher reimbursable electric power and storage costs which are substantially offset in\nService revenues.\nThe increase was also a result of higher expenses associated with our upstream operations, increased costs associated with Transco's Leidy South expansion project placed in service in December 2021, higher employee-related expenses, and higher expenses associated with the 2022 Trace Acquisition and NorTex Asset Purchase.\n53\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nincreased primarily due to amortization of intangibles acquired in the Sequent and Trace Acquisitions and an increase in depreciation at Transco related to ARO revisions (offset in\nOther (income) expense – net\nwithin\nOperating income (loss)\nresulting in no net impact on our results of operations), partially offset by the absence of 2021 depreciation on certain decommissioned facilities in our West segment.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses driven by the Sequent Acquisition in July 2021 and higher expenses for various corporate costs, including technology costs to support efforts to track and quantify emissions associated with natural gas procurement, transmission, and delivery.\nOther (income) expense – net\nwithin\nOperating income (loss)\nchanged unfavorably primarily due to charges related to Eminence storage cavern abandonments and monitoring, as well as regulatory charges associated with a decrease in Transco’s estimated deferred state income tax rate, offset by the deferral of ARO depreciation (offset in\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nresulting in no net impact on our results of operations).\nEquity earnings (losses)\nchanged favorably primarily due to increases at investments across our West segment, including RMM, and at Laurel Mountain, partially offset by a decrease at Appalachia Midstream Investments.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nchanged favorably primarily due to a benefit associated with a decrease in our estimate of the state deferred income tax rate, a benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance, and federal settlements, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. See Note 6 – Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.\nThe unfavorable change in\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nis primarily due to higher results at the Northeast JV.\n2021 vs. 2020\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to higher transportation fee revenues associated with expansion projects placed in service at Transco in 2020 and 2021, higher revenue associated with reimbursable electricity expenses, and higher processing and fractionation revenues in our Northeast G&P segment. This increase was partially offset by lower volume deficiency fee revenues, lower gathering volumes, and lower deferred revenue amortization.\nService revenues – commodity consideration\nincreased primarily due to higher NGL prices. These revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for processing services provided. Most of these NGL volumes are sold during the month processed and therefore are offset within\nProduct costs\nbelow.\nProduct sales\nincreased primarily due to higher prices and volumes associated with our natural gas and NGL marketing activities, as well as the inclusion of our recently acquired upstream operations. This increase also includes higher prices related to our equity NGL sales activities. These increases were partially offset by negative product marketing sales from operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition in 2021 (which does not reflect commodity derivative net realized gains discussed below).\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nincludes realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments. The unfavorable change primarily reflects net unrealized losses in our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment, and net realized losses related to derivative contracts in our West and Other segments. Net realized gains at our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment partially offset these impacts.\nProduct costs\nincreased primarily due to higher prices and volumes associated with our natural gas and NGL marketing activities, as well as higher NGL prices associated with volumes acquired as commodity consideration related to our equity NGL production activities.\n54\nNet processing commodity expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher prices for natural gas purchases associated with our equity NGL production activities, partially offset by lower volumes.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nincreased primarily due to the inclusion of our recently acquired upstream operations and higher employee-related expenses, which reflect the absence of a 2020 favorable impact of a change in an employee benefit policy and increased incentive compensation costs associated with improved company performance, as well as higher reimbursable electricity expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nincreased primarily due to the inclusion of our recently acquired upstream operations, reduced estimated useful lives for certain facilities in our West segment decommissioned during 2021, new assets placed in-service at Transco, and the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the Sequent Acquisition.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, which reflect increased incentive compensation costs associated with improved company performance, Sequent Acquisition employee-related costs, and the absence of a 2020 favorable impact of a change in an employee benefit policy, partially offset by lower expenses for various corporate costs.\nImpairment of certain assets\nreflects the 2020 impairment of our Northeast Supply Enhancement development project and certain gathering assets in the Marcellus Shale region (see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nImpairment of goodwill\nreflects the goodwill impairment charge at the Northeast reporting unit in 2020 (see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nEquity earnings (losses)\nchanged favorably primarily due to the absence of the 2020 impairment of goodwill at RMM, increases at Appalachia Midstream Investments, Laurel Mountain, Blue Racer, Aux Sable, and Discovery, partially offset by a decrease at OPPL.\nImpairment of equity-method investments\nreflects the absence of 2020 impairments to various equity-method investments (see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe favorable change in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nreflects the absence of a 2020 charge for a legal settlement associated with former olefins operations and the absence of 2020 write-offs of certain regulatory assets related to cancelled projects, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a 2021 accrual for a loss contingency.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nchanged unfavorably primarily due to higher pre-tax income. See Note 6 – Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.\nThe unfavorable change in\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nis primarily due to the absence of our partner’s share of the 2020 goodwill impairment at the Northeast reporting unit.\nYear-Over-Year Operating Results – Segments\nWe evaluate segment operating performance based upon\nModified EBITDA\n. Note 18 – Segment Disclosures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to\nNet income (loss)\n. Management uses\nModified EBITDA\nbecause it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance. In addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets.\nModified EBITDA\nshould not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n55\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico\n_______________\n(1)\nIncluded as a component of\nCommodity margins\n.\n2022 vs. 2021\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to higher\nService revenues\n, partially offset by higher\nOther segment costs and expenses.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $163 million increase in Transco’s service revenues primarily associated with the Leidy South expansion project placed fully in service in December 2021, park and loan services, short-term firm transportation, overall demand, and commodity fee revenues. Additionally, 2022 benefited from higher reimbursable electric power costs and storage rates effective since the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by lower cash out surcharges, all of which are offset by similar changes in electricity, storage and cash out charges reflected in\nOther segment costs and expenses;\n•\nA $21 million increase in the Eastern Gulf Coast region primarily due to higher production handling and gathering volumes from the absence of temporary shut-ins due to producer operational issues and weather-related events in 2021, partially offset by a decrease at Gulfstar One for the Tubular Bells field primarily due to lower production handling, gathering and transportation volumes from natural decline;\n•\nA $16 million increase primarily related to storage and transportation revenues due to the acquisition of NorTex in August 2022; partially offset by\n•\nA $13 million decrease in the Western Gulf Coast region primarily at Perdido due to lower transportation and gathering volumes from temporary downtime from producer operational issues in 2022.\nCommodity margins\nassociated with our equity NGLs increased $5 million primarily driven by favorable NGL sales prices, partially offset by higher prices for natural gas purchases associated with our equity NGL production activities.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher operating costs including higher reimbursable electric power costs and storage costs, partially offset by favorable cash out charges, all of which are offset by similar changes in electricity reimbursements, cash out charges, and storage revenues reflected in\nService revenues.\nAdditionally, 2022 was impacted by higher costs associated with the Leidy South expansion project;\n56\nmaintenance costs primarily related to general maintenance at Transco, Gulf Coast region, and Northwest Pipeline; charges related to Eminence storage cavern abandonments and monitoring; and regulatory charges associated with a decrease in Transco’s estimated deferred state income tax rate, higher employee-related costs, corporate allocations, and operations acquired in the NorTex Asset Purchase. These increases are partially offset by a favorable change in the deferral of ARO related depreciation at Transco.\n2021 vs. 2020\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to favorable changes to\nImpairment of certain assets\nand\nService revenues,\npartially offset by higher\nOther segment costs and expenses.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $135 million increase in Transco’s and Northwest Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage revenues primarily associated with expansion projects placed in service in 2020 and 2021, higher reimbursable electric power costs and a cash out surcharge, which are offset by similar changes in electricity and cash out charges, reflected in\nOther segment costs and expenses\n;\n•\nA $21 million increase from the Norphlet pipeline associated primarily with higher deferred revenue amortization and higher volumes;\n•\nAn $18 million increase at Perdido primarily driven by higher volumes due to the absence of temporary shut-ins in 2020 related to scheduled maintenance and fewer Western Gulf of Mexico weather-related events; partially offset by\n•\nA $25 million decrease at Gulfstar One for the Tubular Bells field primarily associated with lower deferred revenue amortization from lower contractually determined maximum daily quantities;\n•\nA $17 million decrease due to lower volumes at Gulfstar One in the Gunflint field due to ongoing producer operational issues, partially offset by the lower temporary shut-ins related to pricing in 2020.\nCommodity margins\nassociated with our equity NGLs increased $21 million primarily driven by favorable NGL sales prices.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher incentive and benefit employee-related costs as previously discussed; higher operating costs, including higher reimbursable electric power costs; and a cash out surcharge reserve, which are offset by similar changes in electricity and cash out reimbursements, reflected in\nService revenues;\nand higher operating taxes, partially offset by a favorable change associated with the deferral of asset retirement obligation-related depreciation at Transco.\nImpairment of certain assets\nreflects the absence of the impairment of our Northeast Supply Enhancement development project in 2020 (see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\nincreased at Discovery driven by higher NGL sales prices and higher volumes due to the absence of prior year scheduled maintenance.\n57\nNortheast G&P\n(1)\nIncluded as a component of\nCommodity margins\n.\n2022 vs. 2021\nNortheast G&P Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to higher\nService revenues\n, partially offset by lower\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\nand higher\nOther segment costs and expenses\n.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $64 million increase in revenues at the Northeast JV primarily related to higher gathering, processing, and fractionation volumes as well as higher processing rates;\n•\nA $43 million increase in revenues in the Utica Shale region primarily related to higher gathering rates resulting from annual cost of service contract redeterminations, as well as proceeds from the release of an acreage dedication;\n•\nA $14 million increase in revenues associated with reimbursable expenses, which is offset by similar changes in the charges reflected in\nOther segment costs and expenses;\n•\nNo change in revenues at Susquehanna Supply Hub primarily related to higher gathering rates, offset by lower gathering volumes.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher operating expenses, including higher electricity and fuel, which is partially offset in\nService revenues\n.\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\ndecreased at Appalachia Midstream Investments primarily driven by lower gathering rates resulting from annual cost of service contract redeterminations as well as lower volumes. Additionally, there was a decrease at Blue Racer primarily due to lower volumes. The decrease was partially offset by an increase at Laurel Mountain primarily due to higher commodity-based gathering rates.\n58\n2021 vs. 2020\nNortheast G&P Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to increased\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\nand higher\nService revenues\n, partially offset by increased\nOther segment costs and expenses\n.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $27 million increase in revenues associated with reimbursable electricity expenses, which is offset by similar changes in electricity charges, reflected in\nOther segment costs and expenses;\n•\nA $23 million increase in revenues at the Northeast JV primarily related to higher processing and fractionation volumes, partially offset by lower gathering volumes;\n•\nA $6 million increase in revenues at Susquehanna Supply Hub primarily related to higher gathering rates, partially offset by lower gathering volumes.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher maintenance and operating expenses, including higher electricity charges, as well as higher incentive and benefit employee-related costs as previously discussed.\nImpairment of certain assets\nreflects a $12 million impairment of certain gathering assets in the Marcellus Shale region in 2020 (see Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\nincreased at Appalachia Midstream Investments primarily driven by higher volumes as well as the absence of our $26 million share of an impairment of certain assets in 2020 that were subsequently sold. Additionally, there was an increase at Blue Racer primarily due to the favorable impact of increased ownership as well as the absence of our $10 million share of an impairment of certain assets in 2020. There was also an increase at Laurel Mountain due to higher commodity-based gathering rates as well as the absence of our $11 million share of an impairment of certain assets in 2020 that were subsequently sold and higher MVC revenue, partially offset by lower volumes, and an increase at Aux Sable.\n59\nWest\n________________\n(1) Included as a component of\nCommodity margins\n.\n2022 vs. 2021\nWest Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to higher\nService revenues\nand a favorable change in\nNet realized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives,\npartially offset by higher\nOther segment costs and expenses.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $186 million increase in the Haynesville Shale region primarily due to higher gathering volumes including volumes from the Trace Acquisition as well as higher gathering rates driven by favorable commodity pricing;\n•\nA $96 million increase in the Barnett Shale region primarily due to higher gathering rates driven by favorable commodity pricing;\n•\nA $14 million increase associated with higher fractionation fees primarily due to higher fractionation volumes from a new contract;\n•\nA $4 million increase in the Eagle Ford region primarily due to higher MVC revenues, escalated gathering rates, and higher deferred revenue amortization, substantially offset by lower volumes due to decreased producer activity; partially offset by\n•\nA $10 million decrease in the Wamsutter region primarily due to lower MVC revenue.\nNet realized gain (loss) on commodity derivatives – service revenues\nchanged favorably due to a change in settled commodity prices relative to our hedge positions.\nProduct margins from our equity NGLs increased $6 million primarily due to higher net realized NGL sales prices, partially offset by higher net realized prices for natural gas purchases associated with our equity NGL production activities. Additionally, volumes of equity NGL sold and natural gas purchased associated with our\n60\nequity NGL production activities were lower primarily due to a customer contract change. Margins from other sales activities increased $16 million primarily due to higher condensate sales and favorable pricing. Marketing margins decreased $20 million primarily due to the absence of the favorable impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher operating expenses related to timing and scope of activities including from operations acquired in the Trace Acquisition, the absence of gains on asset sales in 2021, higher corporate allocations, acquisition-related costs associated with the Trace Acquisition in 2022, and an unfavorable change in our net imbalance liability due to changes in pricing.\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\nincreased primarily due to higher volumes at OPPL and higher commodity prices and volumes at RMM.\n2021 vs. 2020\nWest Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to higher\nCommodity margins,\npartially offset by lower\nService revenues\n.\nService revenues\ndecreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $63 million decrease associated with lower volumes, primarily due to production declines in the Eagle Ford Shale region which impact is substantially offset by recognition of higher MVC revenue (see below);\n•\nA $22 million decrease driven by lower deferred revenue amortization, primary in the Barnett Shale region; partially offset by\n•\nA $37 million increase associated with higher MVC revenue primarily in the Eagle Ford Shale region, partially offset by lower MVC revenue in the Wamsutter region;\n•\nA $17 million increase in revenues associated primarily with reimbursable compressor power and fuel purchases due to higher prices related to the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021, which are offset by similar changes in\nOther segment costs and expenses;\n•\nA $10 million increase associated with higher net realized gathering and processing rates, primarily in the Barnett Shale and Piceance regions due to higher commodity pricing, along with escalated gathering rates in the Eagle Ford Shale region, partially offset by a decrease in gathering rates in the Haynesville Shale region due to a customer contract change.\nMarketing margins increased by $36 million primarily due to favorable changes in net realized natural gas and NGL prices, including the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021. Product margins from our equity NGLs increased by $13 million, primarily due to favorable net realized commodity price changes, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Margins on other sales of products increased $12 million primarily due to higher commodity prices.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher incentive and benefit employee-related expenses as previously discussed, higher reimbursable compressor power and fuel purchases which are offset in\nService revenues,\nand higher compressor and plant fuel expenses which are not reimbursable, partially offset by  gains on asset sales in 2021, lower leased compressor expenses, favorable changes in system gains and losses, lower legal and consulting expenses, and favorable settlements.\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\ndecreased primarily due to lower volumes at OPPL, partially offset by higher volumes and commodity prices at Brazos Permian II.\n61\nGas & NGL Marketing Services\n________________\n(1) Included as a component of\nCommodity margins\n.\n2022 vs. 2021\nGas & NGL Marketing Services Modified EBITDA\ndecreased primarily due to higher net unrealized loss from derivative instruments and higher\nOther segment costs and expenses\n, partially offset by higher\nCommodity margins\n.\nCommodity margins\nincreased $158 million primarily due to:\n•\nA $188 million increase in natural gas marketing margins which included the following:\n◦\nA $301 million increase in natural gas transportation capacity marketing margins primarily resulting from the Sequent Acquisition in the third quarter of 2021 and an increase in favorable pricing spreads in 2022 compared to 2021; partially offset by\n◦\nA $58 million decrease associated with our legacy natural gas marketing operations primarily due to the absence of the favorable impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021;\n◦\nA $55 million decrease in natural gas storage marketing margins due primarily to an increase in lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments of $115 million and higher storage fees, partially offset by higher storage withdrawals in 2022 compared to 2021.\n•\nA $30 million decrease in our NGL marketing margins primarily due to lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustments in 2022.\nNet unrealized gain (loss) from derivative instruments\nchanged primarily due to the Sequent Acquisition in July 2021, and a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions in 2022 compared to 2021.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to higher employee-related costs related to the Sequent Acquisition and higher corporate allocations.\n62\n2021 vs. 2020\nGas & NGL Marketing Services Modified EBITDA\ndecreased primarily due to higher net unrealized losses from derivative instruments, lower\nService revenues\n, and higher segment costs and expenses, partially offset by higher\nCommodity margins.\nService revenues\ndecreased due to the absence of a temporary volume deficiency fee associated with reduced volumes from a shipper on OPPL in 2020.\nCommodity margins\nincreased $135 million primarily due to:\n•\nA $112 million increase associated with our legacy natural gas and NGL marketing operations primarily due to favorable changes in net realized natural gas prices, including the impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021;\n•\nA $23 million increase associated with the operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition in 2021 including $35 million primarily related to favorable pricing spreads on transportation capacity reflecting losses on physical transaction settlements more than offset by net realized gains on derivatives. The transportation related margin was partially offset by a $12 million unfavorable margin related to storage activity. The unfavorable storage margin reflects gains on physical transaction settlements offset by an $18 million charge related to the partial recognition of a purchase accounting inventory fair value adjustment which increased the weighted-average cost of inventory and $13 million related to a lower of cost or net realizable value inventory adjustment.\nThe\nNet unrealized gain (loss) from derivative instruments\nchanged primarily due to the Sequent Acquisition in July 2021, and a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to employee-related costs associated with the operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition in 2021.\nOther\n________________\n(1) Included as a component of\nNet realized product sales\n.\n63\n2022 vs. 2021\nOther Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to $248 million higher results from our upstream operations which included the following:\n•\nA $289 million increase in\nNet realized product sales\nprimarily due to higher commodity prices in 2022, partially offset by the absence of the favorable impact of Winter Storm Uri in 2021 and an unfavorable change in\nNet realized gain (loss) from derivative instruments\ndue to an increase in commodity prices relative to our hedge positions and an increase in the volume of production hedged in 2022 compared to 2021.\nNet realized product sales\nalso increased due to higher production from new wells and higher volumes associated with acquisitions of additional ownership interests in 2021;\n•\nA $25 million favorable change in\nNet unrealized gain (loss) from derivative instruments\ndue to a change in forward commodity prices relative to our hedge positions and an increase in the volume of production hedged in 2022 compared to 2021; partially offset by\n•\nA $66 million increase in\nOther segment costs and expenses\nprimarily due to the increased scale of our upstream operations and higher associated production taxes which were also impacted by higher commodity prices and higher volumes as well as higher tax rates.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nalso includes an $11 million charge related to an accrual for loss contingency in 2022, substantially offset by the absence of a $10 million charge related to an accrual for loss contingency in 2021.\n2021 vs. 2020\nOther Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $168 million increase related to our upstream operations, including the favorable commodity price impact of Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021;\n•\nA $24 million increase due to the absence of a 2020 charge related to a legal settlement associated with our former olefins operations;\n•\nA $15 million increase due to the absence of 2020 charges related to write-offs of certain regulatory assets associated with cancelled projects; partially offset by\n•\nA $10 million decrease associated with a 2021 charge related to a legal settlement.\n64\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity\nOverview\nWe have continued to focus on earnings and cash flow growth, while continuing to improve leverage metrics and operating costs metrics. During 2022, we issued approximately $1.75 billion of new long-term debt primarily to fund current or near-term maturities. In April 2022, we completed the Trace Acquisition; and in August 2022, we completed the NorTex Asset Purchase, both of which were funded with available sources of short-term liquidity (see Note 3 – Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). See also the section titled\nSources (Uses) of Cash\n.\nOutlook\nOur growth capital and investment expenditures in 2023 are currently expected to be in a range from $1.40 billion to $1.70 billion, excluding the MountainWest Acquisition. Growth capital spending in 2023 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, projects supporting the Northeast G&P business and projects supporting growth in the Haynesville basin, including the Louisiana Energy Gateway project. We also expect to invest capital in the development of our upstream oil and gas properties. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that reduce emissions, meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. We intend to fund substantially all planned 2023 capital spending with cash available after paying dividends. We retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of growth capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities including the repurchase of our common stock.\nOn February 14, 2023, we acquired 100 percent of MountainWest which includes FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and natural gas storage capacity, for $1.08 billion of cash and assumption of $430 million outstanding principal amount of long-term debt, subject to working capital and post-closing adjustments. The acquisition was funded with available sources of short-term liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have approximately $627 million of long-term debt due within one year. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash on hand, proceeds from refinancing, our credit facility, or our commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.\nLiquidity\nBased on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2023. Our potential material internal and external sources and uses of liquidity are as follows:\n65\nAt December 31, 2022, we have approximately $21.927 billion of long-term debt due after one year. See     Note 12 – Debt and Banking Arrangements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the aggregate maturities over the next five years. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash generated from operations, proceeds from refinancing, our credit facility, or our commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.\nPotential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in Company Outlook\n.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had a working capital deficit of $1.093 billion, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt due within one year. Our available liquidity is as follows:\n__________\n(1)\nIn managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of our credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program. We had $350 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022. The highest amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and credit facility during 2022 was $1.219 billion. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our credit facility. See Note 12 – Debt and Banking Arrangements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facility and commercial paper program.\nDividends\nWe increased our regular quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders by approximately 3.7 percent from the $0.41 per share paid in each quarter of 2021, to $0.425 per share paid in each quarter of 2022.\nRegistrations\nIn February 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement as a well-known seasoned issuer.\nDistributions from Equity-Method Investees\nThe organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require periodic distributions of their available cash to their members. In each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. See Note 8 – Investing Activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our more significant equity-method investees.\nCredit Ratings\nThe interest rates at which we are able to borrow money are impacted by our credit ratings. The current ratings are as follows:\nThese credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. No assurance can be given that\n66\nthe credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment-grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current criteria for investment-grade ratios. A downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our future cost of borrowing and, if ratings were to fall below investment-grade, could require us to provide additional collateral to third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity.\nSources (Uses) of Cash\nThe following table summarizes the sources (uses) of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Notes referenced in the table):\nOperating activities\nThe factors that determine operating activities are largely the same as those that affect\nNet income (loss)\n, with the exception of noncash items such as\nDepreciation and amortization\n,\nProvision (benefit) for deferred income taxes\n,\nEquity (earnings) losses\n,\nImpairment of goodwill\n,\nImpairment of equity-method investments\n,\nImpairment of certain assets\n,\nNet unrealized (gain) loss from derivative instruments\n, and\nInventory write-downs.\nOur\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities\nin 2022 increased from 2021 primarily due to higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed), favorable changes in margin requirements, and higher\nDistributions from equity-method investees\n, partially offset by net unfavorable changes in net operating working capital.\nOur\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities\nin 2021 increased from 2020 primarily due to higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed), favorable changes in net operating working capital reflecting the absence in 2021 of the Transco rate refund payment made in 2020, and higher distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2021, partially offset by unfavorable changes in current and noncurrent derivative assets and liabilities.\n67\nEnvironmental\nWe are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own (see Note 17 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the EPA, or other governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately $40 million, all of which are included in\nAccrued and other current liabilities\nand\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022. We will seek to recover approximately $4 million of accrued costs related to remediation activities by our interstate gas pipelines through future natural gas transmission rates. The remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. During 2022, we paid approximately $5 million for cleanup and/or remediation and monitoring activities. We expect to pay approximately $11 million in 2023 for these activities. Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. At December 31, 2022, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other governmental authorities, and other factors.\nThe EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely propose and promulgate new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, reviews and updates to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and rules for new and existing source performance standards for volatile organic compounds and methane. We continuously monitor these regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. Implementation of new or modified regulations may result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nfor both new and existing facilities in affected areas; however, due to regulatory uncertainty on final rule content and applicability timeframes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost these regulatory impacts at this time.\nWe consider prudently incurred environmental assessment and remediation costs and the costs associated with compliance with environmental standards to be recoverable through rates for our interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. Historically, with limited exceptions, we have been permitted recovery of these environmental costs, and it is our intent to continue seeking recovery of such costs through future rate filings.\n68"

    "text": "Interest Rate Risk\nOur current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio. Our debt portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate debt, which mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. Any borrowings under our credit facility and any issuances under our commercial paper program could be at a variable interest rate and could expose us to the risk of increasing interest rates. The maturity of our long-term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected lives of our operating assets. (See Note 12 – Debt and Banking Arrangements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nThe tables below provide information by maturity date about our interest rate risk-sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the methods used in determining the fair value of our long-term debt.\n__________________\n(1)    Includes unamortized discount / premium and debt issuance costs.\n(2)  The weighted-average interest rate for commercial paper was 4.8 percent as of December 31, 2022.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk through our natural gas and NGL marketing activities, including contracts to purchase, sell, transport, and store product. We routinely manage this risk with a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts such as forward contracts, futures contracts, and basis swaps, as well as physical transactions. Although many of the contracts used to manage commodity exposure are derivative instruments, these economic hedges are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\nWe are also exposed to commodity prices through our upstream business and certain gathering and processing contracts. We use derivative instruments to lock in forward sales prices on a portion of our expected future production. These economic hedges are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.\n69\nThe maturities of our derivative contracts at December 31, 2022, as well as the maturities of the derivative contracts related to the operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition at December 31, 2021, were as follows:\n_______________\n(1)\nSee Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of valuation techniques by level within the fair value hierarchy. See Note 16 – Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of change in fair value recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income.\n(2)\nNet commodity derivative assets and liabilities exclude $202 million of net cash collateral in Level 1.\n(3)\nNet commodity derivative assets and liabilities related to the operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition exclude $267 million of net cash collateral in Level 1.\nValue at Risk (VaR)\nVaR is the maximum predicted loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability. Our VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the factors used to calculate VaR. Our VaR is determined using parametric models with 95 percent confidence intervals and one-day holding periods, which means that 95 percent of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. Our open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of predicted financial loss to management. Because we generally manage physical gas assets and economically protect our positions by hedging in the futures markets, our open exposure is generally mitigated. We employ daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of our positions.\nWe actively monitor open commodity marketing positions and the resulting VaR and maintain a relatively small risk exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Starting in the second quarter of 2022, following the further integration of our legacy trading activities with the operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition, we now present VaR for our integrated natural gas trading operations. For the second half of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, the VaR presented reflects the legacy Sequent operations only.\n70\nAt December 31, 2022, the VaR associated with this activity was $10 million. We had the following VaRs for the periods shown:\nOur non-trading portfolio primarily consists of derivatives that hedge our upstream business and certain gathering and processing contracts. At December 31, 2022, the VaR associated with these derivatives was $8 million.\n71"

Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or in such other manner as determined by our management. Our management will also determine the timing and amount of any repurchases based on market conditions and other factors. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and  it  may  be suspended or discontinued at any time. This share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. There were $\n9\nmillion and\nno\nrepurchases under the program in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDescription of Business\nWe are a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Our operations are located in the United States and are presented within the following reportable segments: Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, West, and Gas & NGL Marketing Services, consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources. All remaining business activities, including our upstream operations, as well as corporate activities are included in Other.\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipelines, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) and Northwest Pipeline LLC (Northwest Pipeline), and their related natural gas storage facilities, as well as natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, including a\n51\npercent interest in Gulfstar One LLC (Gulfstar One) (a consolidated variable interest entity, or VIE), a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream), and a\n60\npercent equity-method investment in Discovery Producer Services LLC (Discovery). Transmission & Gulf of Mexico also includes natural gas storage facilities and pipelines providing services in north Texas.\nNortheast G&P is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a\n65\npercent interest in Ohio Valley Midstream LLC (Northeast JV) (a consolidated VIE) which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a\n66\npercent interest in Cardinal Gas Services, L.L.C. (Cardinal) (a consolidated VIE) which operates in Ohio, a\n69\npercent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC (Laurel Mountain), a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Blue Racer Midstream LLC (Blue Racer), and Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary that owns equity-method investments with an approximate average\n66\npercent interest in multiple gas gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale region (Appalachia Midstream Investments).\nWest is comprised of our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of east Texas and northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko and Permian basins. This segment also includes our NGL storage facilities, an undivided\n50\n80\npercent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Overland Pass Pipeline Company LLC (OPPL), a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Rocky Mountain Midstream Holdings LLC (RMM), a\n20\npercent equity-method investment in Targa Train 7 LLC (Targa Train 7) (a nonconsolidated VIE), and a\n15\npercent equity-method investment in Brazos Permian II, LLC (Brazos Permian II) (a nonconsolidated VIE).\nGas & NGL Marketing Services is comprised of our NGL and natural gas marketing and trading operations, which includes risk management and transactions related to the storage and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) on strategically positioned assets.\nBasis of Presentation\nDiscontinued operations\nUnless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing operations.\nSignificant risks and uncertainties\nWe believe that the carrying value of certain of our property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets, notably certain acquired assets accounted for as business combinations between 2012 and 2014, may be in excess of current fair value. However, the carrying value of these assets, in our judgment, continues to be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that future strategic decisions, including transactions such as monetizing assets or contributing assets to new ventures with third parties, as well as unfavorable changes in expected producer activities, could impact our assumptions and ultimately result in impairments of these assets. Such transactions or developments may also indicate that certain of our equity-method investments have experienced other-than-temporary declines in value, which could result in impairment.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities that we control and our proportionate interest in the accounts of certain ventures in which we own an undivided interest. Our judgment is required to evaluate whether we control an entity. Key areas of that evaluation include:\n•\nDetermining whether an entity is a VIE (see Note 2 – Variable Interest Entities);\n•\nDetermining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, including evaluating which activities of the VIE most significantly impact its economic performance and the degree of power that we and our related parties have over those activities through our variable interests;\n•\nIdentifying events that require reconsideration of whether an entity is a VIE and continuously evaluating whether we are a VIE’s primary beneficiary;\n•\nEvaluating whether other owners in entities that are not VIEs are able to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of business such that we do not have the power to control such entities.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to investments over which we exercise significant influence but do not control. Distributions received from equity-method investees are presented in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows according to the nature of the distributions approach, which classifies distributions received from equity-method investees as either returns on investment (cash inflows from operating activities) or returns of\n81\ninvestment (cash inflows from investing activities) based on the nature of the activities of the equity-method investee that generated the distribution.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions include:\n•\nImpairment assessments of investments, property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets;\n•\nLitigation-related contingencies;\n•\nEnvironmental remediation obligations;\n•\nDepreciation and/or amortization of long-lived assets, which are comprised of property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets;\n•\nDepreciation and/or amortization of equity-method investment basis differences;\n•\nAsset retirement obligations (AROs);\n•\nMeasurement of fair value of derivatives;\n•\nPension and postretirement valuation variables;\n•\nMeasurement of regulatory liabilities;\n•\nMeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, including assumptions related to the realization of deferred income tax assets;\n•\nRevenue recognition, including estimates utilized in recognition of deferred revenue;\n•\nPurchase price accounting.\nThese estimates are discussed further throughout these notes.\nRegulatory accounting\nTransco and Northwest Pipeline are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and their rates are established by the FERC. Therefore, we have determined that it is appropriate under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, “Regulated Operations,” (ASC 980) that certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense should be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense should be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected return to customers in future rates. Management’s expected recovery of deferred costs and return of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment. We record certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refunded in future rates. Accounting for these operations that are regulated can differ from the accounting requirements for nonregulated operations. For example, for regulated operations, allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) represents the estimated cost of debt and equity funds applicable to utility plant in the process of construction and is capitalized as a cost of property, plant, and equipment because it constitutes an actual cost of construction under established regulatory practices; nonregulated operations are only allowed to capitalize the cost of debt funds related to construction activities, while a component for equity is prohibited. The\n82\ncomponents of our regulatory assets and liabilities relate to the effects of deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction, AROs, shipper imbalance activity, fuel and power cost differentials, depreciation, negative salvage, pension and other postretirement benefits, customer tax refunds, and rate allowances for deferred income taxes at a historically higher federal income tax rate.\nOur current and noncurrent regulatory asset and liability balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nRevenue recognition\nCustomers in our gas pipeline businesses are comprised of public utilities, municipalities, gas marketers and producers, intrastate pipelines, direct industrial users, and electrical power generators. Customers in our midstream businesses are comprised of oil and natural gas producer counterparties. Customers for our product sales are comprised of public utilities, gas marketers, and direct industrial users.\nService revenue contracts from our gas pipeline and midstream businesses contain a series of distinct services, with the majority of our contracts having a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance. Most of our product sales contracts have a single performance obligation with revenue recognized at a point in time when the products have been sold and delivered to the customer.\nCertain customers reimburse us for costs we incur associated with construction of property, plant, and equipment utilized in our operations. For our rate-regulated gas pipeline businesses that apply ASC 980, we follow FERC guidelines with respect to reimbursement of construction costs. FERC tariffs only allow for cost reimbursement and are non-negotiable in nature; thus, in our judgment, the construction activities do not represent an ongoing major and central operation of our gas pipeline businesses and are not within the scope of ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. Accordingly, cost reimbursements are treated as a reduction to the cost of the constructed asset, which are referred to as\nContributions in aid of construction\nin our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. For our midstream businesses, reimbursement and service contracts with customers are viewed together as providing the same commercial objective, as we have the ability to negotiate the mix of consideration between reimbursements and amounts billed over time. Accordingly, we generally recognize reimbursements of construction costs from customers on a gross basis as a contract liability separate from the associated costs included within property, plant, and equipment. The contract liability is recognized into service revenues as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nService Revenues\nGas pipeline businesses:\nRevenues from our regulated interstate natural gas pipeline businesses, which are subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities, including the FERC, include both firm and interruptible transportation and storage contracts. Firm transportation and storage agreements provide for a daily or monthly reservation charge based on the pipeline or storage capacity reserved, and a commodity charge\n83\nbased on the volume of natural gas delivered/stored, each at rates specified in our FERC tariffs or based on negotiated contractual rates, with contract terms that are generally long-term in nature. Most of our long-term contracts contain an evergreen provision, which allows the contracts to be extended for periods primarily up to one year in length an indefinite number of times following the specified contract term and until terminated generally by either us or the customer. Interruptible transportation and storage agreements provide for a volumetric charge based on actual commodity transportation or storage utilized in the period in which those services are provided, and the contracts are generally limited to one-month periods or less. Our performance obligations related to our interstate natural gas pipeline businesses include the following:\n•\nFirm transportation or storage under firm transportation and storage contracts—an integrated package of services typically constituting a single performance obligation, which includes standing ready to provide such services and receiving, transporting or storing (as applicable), and redelivering commodities;\n•\nInterruptible transportation or storage under interruptible transportation and storage contracts—an integrated package of services typically constituting a single performance obligation once scheduled, which includes receiving, transporting or storing (as applicable), and redelivering commodities.\nIn situations where, in our judgment, we consider the integrated package of services as a single performance obligation, which represents a majority of our interstate natural gas pipeline contracts with customers, we do not consider there to be multiple performance obligations because the nature of the overall promise in the contract is to stand ready (with regard to firm transportation and storage contracts), receive, transport or store, and redeliver natural gas to the customer; therefore, revenue is recognized over time upon satisfaction of our daily stand ready performance obligation.\nWe recognize revenues for reservation charges over the performance obligation period, which is the contract term, regardless of the volume of natural gas that is transported or stored. Revenues for commodity charges from both firm and interruptible transportation services and storage services are recognized when natural gas is delivered at the agreed upon delivery point or when natural gas is injected or withdrawn from the storage facility because they specifically relate to our efforts to provide these distinct services. Generally, reservation charges and commodity charges in our interstate natural gas pipeline businesses are recognized as revenue in the same period they are invoiced to our customers. As a result of the ratemaking process, certain amounts collected by us may be subject to refund upon the issuance of final orders by the FERC in pending rate proceedings. We use judgment to record estimates of rate refund liabilities considering our and other third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel, and other risks.\nMidstream businesses:\nRevenues from our non-regulated gathering, processing, transportation, and storage midstream businesses include contracts for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression, transportation, and other related services with contract terms that are generally long-term in nature and may extend up to the production life of the associated reservoir. Additionally, our midstream businesses generate revenues from fees charged for storing customers’ natural gas and NGLs, generally under prepaid contracted storage capacity contracts. In situations where, in our judgment, we provide an integrated package of services combined into a single performance obligation, which represents a majority of this class of contracts with customers, we do not consider there to be multiple performance obligations because the nature of the overall promise in the contract is to provide gathering, processing, transportation, storage, and related services resulting in the delivery, or redelivery in the context of storage services, of pipeline-quality natural gas and NGLs to the customer. As such, revenue is recognized at the daily completion of the integrated package of services as the integrated package represents a single performance obligation. Additionally, certain contracts in our midstream businesses contain fixed or upfront payment terms that result in the deferral of revenues until such services have been performed or such capacity has been made available.\nWe also earn revenues from offshore crude oil and natural gas gathering and transportation and offshore production handling. These services represent an integrated package of services and are considered a single distinct performance obligation for which we recognize revenues as the services are provided to the customer.\n84\nWe generally earn a contractually stated fee per unit for the volume of product transported, gathered, processed, or stored. The rate is generally fixed; however, certain contracts contain variable rates that are subject to change based on commodity prices, levels of throughput, or an annual adjustment based on a formulaic cost of service calculation. In addition, we have contracts with contractually stated fees that decline over the contract term, such as declines based on the passage of time periods or achievement of cumulative throughput amounts. For all of our contracts, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the judgmentally determined relative standalone selling price. The excess of consideration received over revenue recognized results in the deferral of those amounts until future periods based on a units of production or straight-line methodology as these methods appropriately match the consumption of services provided to the customer. The units of production methodology requires the use of production estimates that are uncertain and the use of judgment when developing estimates of future production volumes, thus impacting the rate of revenue recognition. Production estimates are monitored as circumstances and events warrant. Certain of our gas gathering and processing agreements have minimum volume commitments (MVC). If a customer under such an agreement fails to meet its MVC for a specified period (thus not exercising all the contractual rights to gathering and processing services within the specified period, herein referred to as “breakage”), it is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based upon the shortfall between the actual gathered or processed volumes and the MVC for the period contained in the contract. When we conclude, based on management’s judgment, it is probable that the customer will not exercise all or a portion of its remaining rights, we recognize revenue associated with such breakage amount in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights within the respective MVC period.\nUnder keep-whole and percent-of-liquids processing contracts, we receive commodity consideration in the form of NGLs and take title to the NGLs at the tailgate of the plant. We recognize such commodity consideration as service revenue based on the market value of the NGLs retained at the time the processing is provided. The current market value, as opposed to the market value at the contract inception date, is used due to a combination of factors, including the fact that the volume, mix, and market price of NGL consideration to be received is unknown at the time of contract execution and is not specified in our contracts with customers. Additionally, product sales revenue (discussed below) is recognized upon the sale of the NGLs to a third party based on the sales price at the time of sale. As a result, revenue is recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income both at the time the processing service is provided in\nService revenues – commodity consideration\nand at the time the NGLs retained as part of the processing service are sold in\nProduct sales\n. The recognition of revenue related to commodity consideration has the impact of increasing the book value of NGL inventory, resulting in higher cost of goods sold at the time of sale.\nProduct Sales\nIn the course of providing transportation services to customers of our gas pipeline businesses and gathering and processing services to customers of our midstream businesses, we may receive different quantities of natural gas from customers than the quantities delivered on behalf of those customers. The resulting imbalances are primarily settled through the purchase or sale of natural gas with each customer under terms provided for in our FERC tariffs or gathering and processing agreements, respectively. Revenue is recognized from the sale of natural gas upon settlement of imbalances.\nIn certain instances, we purchase NGLs, crude oil, and natural gas from our oil and natural gas producer customers which we remarket. In addition, we retain NGLs as consideration in certain processing arrangements, as discussed above in the Service Revenues - Midstream businesses section. We also market natural gas and NGLs from the production at our upstream properties. We recognize revenue from the sale of these commodities when the products have been sold and delivered. Our product sales contracts are primarily short-term contracts based on prevailing market rates at the time of the transaction.\nWe purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price paid to buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than an estimated, forward market price that can be received in the future, resulting in positive net product sales. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures\n85\ncontracts and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are used to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the stored natural gas is sold. Additionally, we enter into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve our customers and various markets.\nThe physical purchase, transportation, storage, and sale of natural gas are accounted for on a weighted-average cost or accrual basis, as appropriate, unlike the fair value basis utilized for the derivatives used to mitigate the natural gas price risk associated with the storage and transportation portfolio. Monthly demand charges are incurred for the contracted storage and transportation capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements, and these demand charges and payments are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income in the period they are incurred.\nAs we are acting as an agent for our natural gas marketing customers and engage in energy trading activities, our natural gas marketing revenues are presented net of the related costs of those activities. Prior to the 2022 integration of our legacy gas marketing operations with the acquired Sequent Acquisition operations (see Note 3 – Acquisitions), our legacy gas marketing operations were reported on a gross basis.\nContract Assets\nOur contract assets primarily consist of revenue recognized under contracts containing MVC features whereby management has concluded it is probable there will be a short-fall payment at the end of the current MVC period, which typically follows the calendar year, and that a significant reversal of revenue recognized currently for the future MVC payment will not occur. As a result, our contract assets related to our future MVC payments are generally expected to be collected within the next 12 months and are included within\nOther current assets and deferred charges\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet until such time as the MVC short-fall payments are invoiced to the customer.\nContract Liabilities\nOur contract liabilities consist of advance payments primarily from midstream business customers which include construction reimbursements, prepayments, and other billings and transactions for which future services are to be provided under the contract. These amounts are deferred until recognized in revenue when the associated performance obligation has been satisfied, which is primarily based on a units of production methodology over the remaining contractual service periods, and are classified as current or noncurrent according to when such amounts are expected to be recognized. Current and noncurrent contract liabilities are included within\nAccrued and other current liabilities\nand\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\n, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nContracts requiring advance payments and the recognition of contract liabilities are evaluated to determine whether the advance payments provide us with a significant financing benefit. This determination is based on the combined effect of the expected length of time between when we transfer the promised good or service to the customer, when the customer pays for those goods or services, and the prevailing interest rates. We have assessed our contracts for significant financing components and determined, in our judgment, that one group of contracts entered into in contemplation of one another for certain capital reimbursements contains a significant financing component. As a result, we recognize noncash interest expense based on the effective interest method and revenue (noncash) is recognized when the underlying asset is placed into service utilizing a units of production or straight-line methodology over the life of the corresponding customer contract.\nDerivative instruments and hedging activities\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk. We utilize derivatives to manage a portion of our commodity price risk. These instruments consist primarily of swaps, futures, and forward contracts involving short- and long-term purchases and sales of energy commodities. We purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price paid\n86\nto buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than an estimated, forward market price that can be received in the future. Additionally, we enter into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve our customers and various markets. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures contracts and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity in order to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between receipt and delivery points occurs. Some commodity-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the natural gas marketing operations. These contracts generally meet the definition of derivatives and are typically not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. When a commodity-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed, and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.\nUnrealized gains and losses on physically settled commodity-related derivative contracts for commodity sales transactions are recognized in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nin our\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on non-designated commodity-related derivative contracts for commodity sales transactions that are financially settled are reported in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nin our\nConsolidated Statement of Income. Net gains and losses on derivatives for shrink gas purchases for processing plants are reported in\nNet processing commodity expenses\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nWe experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio as well as upstream related production. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying production or transportation and storage contracts, which is not recognized until the underlying  transaction occurs. (See Note 16 – Derivatives.)\nWe report the fair value of derivatives, except those for which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been elected, in\nDerivative assets; Regulatory assets, deferred charges, and other;\nDerivative liabilities\n; or\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are presented on a net basis and reflect the netting of asset and liability positions permitted under the terms of master netting arrangements and cash held on deposit in margin accounts that we have received or remitted to collateralize certain derivative positions. We determine the current and noncurrent classification based on the timing of expected future cash flows of individual trades.\nThe accounting for the changes in fair value of a commodity derivative can be summarized as follows:\nWe may elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception for certain short- and long-term purchases and sales of physical energy commodities. Under accrual accounting, any change in the fair value of these derivatives is not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet after the initial election of the exception.\nWe may also designate a hedging relationship for certain commodity derivatives. For a derivative to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship, it must meet specific criteria and we must maintain appropriate documentation. We establish hedging relationships pursuant to our risk management policies. We evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. We also regularly assess whether the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no longer expected to be highly effective, or if we believe\n87\nthe likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized currently in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nFor commodity derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is reported in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Gains or losses deferred in AOCI associated with terminated derivatives, derivatives that cease to be highly effective hedges, derivatives for which the forecasted transaction is reasonably possible but no longer probable of occurring, and cash flow hedges that have been otherwise discontinued remain in AOCI until the hedged item affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge will not occur, any gain or loss deferred in AOCI is recognized in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income at that time. The change in likelihood of a forecasted transaction is a judgmental decision that includes qualitative assessments made by us. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we are not applying hedge accounting to any commodity derivative instruments.\nInterest capitalized\nWe capitalize interest during construction on major projects with construction periods of at least\n3\nmonths and a total project cost in excess of $\n1\nmillion. Interest is capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation by the FERC exists, on internally generated funds (equity AFUDC). The latter is included in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income. The rates used by regulated companies are calculated in accordance with FERC rules. Rates used by nonregulated companies are based on our average interest rate on debt.\nIncome taxes\nWe include the operations\nof our\ndomestic\ncorporate\nsubsidiaries and income\nfrom our subsidiary\npartnerships in\nour consolidated\nfed\ne\nral income tax return\nand also file\ntax return\ns\nin\nvarious\nforeign and\nstate\njurisdictions as required\n.\nDeferred income taxes are\ncomputed\nusing the liability\nmethod\nand are provided\non all\ntemporary differences between the\nfinancial\nbasis and the tax basis\nof our assets\nand\nliabilities. Our\njudgment\nand income\ntax\nassumptions\nare used\nto\ndetermine the\nlevels, if\nany, of\nv\naluation\nallowances associated with\ndeferred tax assets.\nEarnings (loss) per common share\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income is based on the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and vested restricted stock units.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income primarily includes any dilutive effect of nonvested restricted stock units and stock options.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\nis calculated using the treasury-stock method.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are carried on a gross basis, with no discounting, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts, considering current expected credit losses using a forward-looking “expected loss” model, the financial condition of our customers, and the age of past due accounts. The majority of our trade receivable balances are due within 30 days. We monitor the credit quality of our counterparties through review of collection trends, credit ratings, and other analyses, such as bankruptcy monitoring. Financial assets from our natural gas transmission and storage business, gathering, processing and transportation business, marketing\n88\nbusiness, and upstream operations are segregated into separate pools for evaluation due to different counterparty risks inherent in each business. Changes in counterparty risk factors could lead to reassessment of the composition of our financial assets as separate pools or the need for additional pools. We calculate our allowance for credit losses incorporating an aging method. In estimating our expected credit losses, we utilize historical loss rates over many years, which include periods of both high and low commodity prices. Commodity prices could have a significant impact on a portion of our gathering and processing and upstream counterparties’ financial health and ability to satisfy current obligations. Our expected credit loss estimate considers both internal and external forward-looking commodity price expectations, as well as counterparty credit ratings, and factors impacting their near-term liquidity. In addition, our expected credit loss estimate considers potential contractual, physical, and commercial protections and outcomes in the case of a counterparty bankruptcy. The physical location and nature of our services help to mitigate collectability concerns of our gathering and processing producer customers. Our gathering lines in many cases are physically connected to the customers’ wellheads and pads, and there may not be alternative gathering lines nearby. The construction of gathering systems is capital intensive and it would be costly for others to replicate, especially considering the depletion to date of the associated reserves. As a result, we play a critical role in getting customers’ production from the wellhead to a marketable condition and location. This tends to reduce collectability risk as our services enable producers to generate operating cash flows. Commodity price movements generally do not impact the majority of our natural gas transmission businesses customers’ financial condition.\nWe also provide marketing and risk management services to retail and wholesale gas marketers, utility companies, upstream producers, and industrial customers. These counterparties utilize netting agreements that enable us to net receivables and payables by counterparty upon settlement. We also net across product lines and against cash collateral received to collateralize receivable positions, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, our counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts receivable and accounts payable.\nWe do not offer extended payment terms and typically receive payment within one month. We consider receivables past due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date. Interest income related to past due accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time full payment is received or collectability is assured. Past due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been exhausted. We do not have a material amount of significantly aged receivables at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nInventories\nInventories\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet primarily consist of natural gas in underground storage, NGLs, and materials and supplies and primarily are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is primarily determined using the average-cost method. Any lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments are included in\nProduct sales\n(for natural gas marketing inventory as these sales are presented net of the related costs) or in\nProduct costs\nfor NGL inventory.\nProperty, plant, and equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is initially recorded at cost. We base the carrying value of these assets on estimates, assumptions, and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful lives, and salvage values.\nAs regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide for depreciation using the straight-line method at FERC-prescribed rates. Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except for certain offshore facilities that apply an accelerated depreciation method.\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our undivided interest in upstream properties. Our oil and gas producing property costs are depreciated using a units of production method.\nGains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of property, plant, and equipment for regulated pipelines are credited or charged to accumulated depreciation.  Gains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of property,\n89\nplant, and equipment for nonregulated assets are primarily recorded in\nOther (income) expense – net\nincluded in\nOperating income (loss)\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nOrdinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are capitalized as property, plant, and equipment.\nWe record a liability and increase the basis in the underlying asset for the present value of each expected future ARO at the time the liability is initially incurred, typically when the asset is acquired or constructed. For our upstream properties, the ARO is recorded based on our working interest in the underlying properties. As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco offset the depreciation of the underlying asset that is attributable to capitalized ARO cost to a regulatory asset as we expect to recover these amounts in future rates. We measure changes in the liability due to passage of time by applying an interest rate to the liability balance. This amount is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as a corresponding accretion expense included in\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income, except for regulated entities, for which the increase in the liability results in a corresponding increase to a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset is amortized commensurate with our collection of those costs in rates.\nMeasurements of AROs include, as a component of future expected costs, an estimate of the price that a third party would demand, and could expect to receive, for bearing the uncertainties inherent in the obligations, sometimes referred to as a market-risk premium.\nIntangible assets\nOur intangible assets included within\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet are primarily related to gas gathering, processing, and fractionation customer relationships. Our intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows. We evaluate these assets for changes in the expected remaining useful lives and would reflect any changes prospectively through amortization over the revised remaining useful life.\nImpairment of property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and investments\nWe evaluate our property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment when, in our judgment, events or circumstances, including probable abandonment, indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether an impairment has occurred and we may apply a probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes, including selling the assets in the near term or holding them for their remaining estimated useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. This evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist.\nFor assets identified to be disposed of in the future and considered held for sale, we compare the carrying value to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if recognition of an impairment is required. Until the assets are disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes estimated cash flows from operations until the assumed date of sale, is recalculated when related events or circumstances change.\nWe evaluate our investments for impairment when, in our judgment, events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized in our consolidated financial statements as an impairment charge.\n90\nJudgment and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s or investment’s fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the probability of sale with respect to assets considered for disposal.\nEquity-method investment basis differences\nDifferences between the carrying value of our equity-method investments and our underlying equity in the net assets of investees are accounted for as if the investees were consolidated subsidiaries.\nEquity earnings (losses)\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income includes our allocable share of net income (loss) of investees adjusted for any depreciation and amortization, as applicable, associated with basis differences.\nLeases\nWe recognize a lease liability with an offsetting right-of-use asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for operating leases based on the present value of the future lease payments. We have elected to combine lease and nonlease components for all classes of leased assets in our calculation of the lease liability and the offsetting right-of-use asset.\nOur lease agreements require both fixed and variable periodic payments, with initial terms typically ranging from\none year\nto\n20\nyears. Payment provisions in certain of our lease agreements contain escalation factors which may be based on stated rates or a change in a published index at a future time. The amount by which a lease escalates based on the change in a published index, which is not known at lease commencement, is considered a variable payment and is not included in the present value of the future lease payments, which only includes those that are stated or can be calculated based on the lease agreement at lease commencement. In addition to the noncancellable periods, many of our lease agreements provide for one or more extensions of the lease agreement for periods ranging from one year in length to an indefinite number of times following the specified contract term. Other lease agreements provide for extension terms that allow us to utilize the identified leased asset for an indefinite period of time so long as the asset continues to be utilized in our operations. In consideration of these renewal features, we assess the term of the lease agreements, which includes using judgment in the determination of which renewal periods and termination provisions, when at our sole election, will be reasonably certain of being exercised. Periods after the initial term or extension terms that allow for either party to the lease to cancel the lease are not considered in the assessment of the lease term. Additionally, we have elected to exclude leases with an original term of one year or less, including renewal periods, from the calculation of the lease liability and the offsetting right-of-use asset.\nWe use judgment in determining the discount rate upon which the present value of the future lease payments is determined. This rate is based on a collateralized interest rate corresponding to the term of the lease agreement using company, industry, and market information available.\nWhen permitted under our lease agreements, we may sublease certain unused office space for fixed periods that could extend up to the length of the original lease agreement.\nPension and other postretirement benefits\nThe funded status of each of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is recognized separately in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability. The plans’ benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (credits) are actuarially determined and impacted by various assumptions and estimates.\nThe discount rates are determined separately for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on an approach specific to our plans. The year-end discount rates are determined considering a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bonds and the timing of the expected benefit cash flows of each plan.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined by combining a review of the historical returns within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the plans’ investment policy statement, and capital\n91\nmarket projections for the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, as well as the weighting of each asset class.\nUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses are deferred and recorded in AOCI or, for Transco and Northwest Pipeline, as a regulatory asset or liability, until amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost (credit). The unrecognized net actuarial losses deferred in AOCI at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $\n18\nmillion and $\n30\nmillion, respectively. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of\n10\npercent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the participants’ average remaining future years of service, which is approximately\n10\nyears for our pension plans and approximately\n5\nyears for our other postretirement benefit plan.\nThe expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost (credit) is calculated using the market-related value of plan assets. For our pension plans, the market-related value of plan assets is equal to the fair value of plan assets adjusted to reflect the amortization of gains or losses associated with the difference between the expected and actual return on plan assets over a\n5\n-year period. Additionally, the market-related value of assets may be no more than\n110\npercent or less than\n90\npercent of the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. The market-related value of plan assets for our other postretirement benefit plan is equal to the unadjusted fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.\nContingent liabilities\nWe record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies, including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are calculated based upon our assumptions and estimates with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss and upon advice of legal counsel, engineers, or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matters. These calculations are made without consideration of any potential recovery from third parties. We recognize insurance recoveries or reimbursements from others when realizable. Revisions to these liabilities are generally reflected in income when new or different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions or estimates.\nTreasury stock\nTreasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as\nTreasury stock, at cost\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of shares are credited or charged to\nCapital in excess of par value\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet using the average-cost method.\nCash flows from revolving credit facility and commercial paper program\nProceeds and payments related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility are reflected in the financing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. Proceeds and payments related to borrowings under our commercial paper program are reflected in the financing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a net basis, as the outstanding notes generally have maturity dates less than three months from the date of issuance. (See Note 12 – Debt and Banking Arrangements.)\nNote 2 – Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nAs of December 31, 2022, we consolidate the following VIEs:\nNortheast JV\nWe own a\n65\npercent interest in the Northeast JV, a subsidiary that is a VIE due to certain of our voting rights being disproportionate to our obligation to absorb losses and substantially all of the Northeast JV’s activities being\n92\nperformed on our behalf. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Northeast JV’s economic performance. The Northeast JV provides midstream services for producers in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale regions. Future expansion activity is expected to be funded with capital contributions from us and the other equity partner on a proportional basis.\nGulfstar One\nWe own a\n51\npercent interest in Gulfstar One, a subsidiary that, due to certain risk-sharing provisions in its customer contracts, is a VIE. Gulfstar One includes a proprietary floating-production system, Gulfstar FPS, and associated pipelines that provide production handling and gathering services in the eastern deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Gulfstar One’s economic performance.\nCardinal\nWe own a\n66\npercent interest in Cardinal, a subsidiary that provides gathering services for the Utica Shale region and is a VIE due to certain risks shared with customers. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Cardinal’s economic performance. Future expansion activity is expected to be funded with capital contributions from us and the other equity partner.\nThe following table presents amounts included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are only for the use or obligation of our consolidated VIEs:\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nTarga Train 7\nWe own a\n20\npercent interest in Targa Train 7, which provides fractionation services at Mont Belvieu, Texas,  and is a VIE due primarily to our limited participating rights as the minority equity holder. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Targa Train 7 was $\n46\nmillion. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\n93\nBrazos Permian II\nWe own a\n15\npercent interest in Brazos Permian II, which provides gathering and processing services in the Delaware basin and is a VIE due primarily to our limited participating rights as the minority equity holder. At December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Brazos Permian II was $\n16\nmillion. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nNote 3 – Acquisitions\nTrace Acquisition\nOn April 29, 2022, we closed on the acquisition of\n100\npercent of Gemini Arklatex, LLC through which we acquired the Haynesville Shale region gas gathering and related assets of Trace Midstream (Trace) for $\n972\nmillion of cash funded with cash on hand and proceeds from issuance of commercial paper (Trace Acquisition). The purpose of the Trace Acquisition was to expand our footprint into the east Texas area of the Haynesville Shale region, increasing in-basin scale in one of the largest growth basins in the country.\nDuring the period from the acquisition date of April 29, 2022 to December 31, 2022, the operations acquired in the Trace Acquisition contributed\nRevenues\nof $\n148\nmillion and\nModified EBITDA\n(as defined in Note 18 – Segment Disclosures) of $\n73\nmillion.\nAcquisition-related costs for the Trace Acquisition for the period from the acquisition date of April 29, 2022 to December 31, 2022 of $\n8\nmillion are reported within our West segment and included in\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nWe accounted for the Trace Acquisition as a business combination, which requires, among other things, that identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values. The valuation techniques used consisted of the income approach (excess earnings method) for valuation of intangible assets and depreciated replacement costs for property, plant, and equipment.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the major classes of the assets acquired, which are presented in the West segment, and liabilities assumed at April 29, 2022. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired equals contractual amounts receivable.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets recognized in the Trace Acquisition are related to contractual customer relationships from gas gathering agreements with our customers. The basis for determining the value of these intangible assets is estimated future net cash flows to be derived from acquired contractual customer relationships discounted using a risk-adjusted\n94\ndiscount rate. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an initial period of\n20\nyears which represents the term over which the contractual customer relationships are expected to contribute to our cash flows. Approximately\n2\npercent of the expected future revenues from these contractual customer relationships are impacted by our ability and intent to renew or renegotiate existing customer contracts. We expense costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of our gas gathering contracts with customers. Based on the estimated future revenues during the current contract periods (as estimated at the time of the acquisition), the weighted-average period prior to the next renewal or extension of the existing contractual customer relationships is approximately\n19\nyears. See   Note 10 – Intangible Assets.\nSequent Acquisition\nOn July 1, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of\n100\npercent of Sequent Energy Management, L.P. and Sequent Energy Canada, Corp (Sequent Acquisition). Total consideration for this acquisition was $\n159\nmillion, which included $\n109\nmillion related to working capital.\nOperations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition focus on risk management and the marketing, trading, storage, and transportation of natural gas for a diverse set of natural gas and electric utilities, municipalities, power generators, and producers, as well as moving gas to markets through transportation and storage agreements on strategically positioned assets, including our Transco system. The purpose of the Sequent Acquisition was to expand our natural gas marketing activities as well as optimize our pipeline and storage capabilities with expansions into new markets to reach incremental gas-fired power generation, liquified natural gas exports, and future renewable natural gas and other emerging opportunities.\nDuring the period from the acquisition date of July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, results for the operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition included net\nProduct sales\nof $(\n43\n) million (including $\n80\nmillion of purchases from affiliates),\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nof $(\n43\n) million, and unfavorable\nModified EBITDA\nof $\n112\nmillion. Both the\nRevenues\nand\nModified EBITDA\namounts reflect a net unrealized loss on commodity derivatives in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nof $(\n109\n) million for the period.\nAcquisition-related costs for the Sequent Acquisition for the period from the acquisition date of July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 of $\n5\nmillion are reported within our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment and were included in\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n95\nWe accounted for the Sequent Acquisition as a business combination. The following table presents the allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the major classes of the assets acquired, which are presented in the Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment, and liabilities assumed at July 1, 2021. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired equals contractual amounts receivable. The fair value of the intangible assets was measured using an income approach. The fair value of the inventory acquired was based on the market price of the natural gas in underground storage at the acquisition date. See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk for the valuation techniques used to measure fair value of derivative assets and liabilities.\nAccounts receivable and accounts payable\nThe operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition provide services to retail and wholesale gas marketers, utility companies, upstream producers, and industrial customers. See Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for our policy regarding netting receivables and payables.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are primarily related to transportation and storage capacity contracts. The basis for determining the value of these intangible assets was estimated future net cash flows to be derived from acquired transportation and storage capacity contracts that provide future economic benefits due to their market location, discounted using an industry weighted-average cost of capital. This intangible asset is being amortized based on the expected benefit period over which the underlying contracts are expected to contribute to our cash flows ranging from\n1\nyear to\n8\nyears. As a result, we expect a significant portion of the amortization to be recognized within the first few years of this range. See Note 10 – Intangible Assets.\nCommodity derivatives\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk. To manage this volatility, we use various contracts in our marketing and trading activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. We enter into commodity-related derivatives to economically hedge exposures to natural gas and retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect our results of operations; see Note 1 – General, Description of\n96\nBusiness, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for our accounting policy for derivatives.\nSupplemental Pro Forma\nThe following pro forma\nRevenues\nand\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\nin 2022, 2021, and 2020, are presented as if the Trace Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2021, and the Sequent Acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2020. These pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would have been if the Trace Acquisition and Sequent Acquisition had in fact occurred on the dates or for the periods indicated, nor do they purport to project\nRevenues\nor\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\nfor any future periods or as of any date. These amounts do not give effect to any potential cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements to result from the transaction or the potential costs to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies, and revenue enhancements.\n(1)\nExcludes results from operations acquired in the Trace Acquisition for the period beginning on the acquisition date of April 29, 2022, as these results are included in the amounts as reported.\n(2)\nExcludes results from operations acquired in the Sequent Acquisition for the period beginning on the acquisition date of July 1, 2021, as these results are included in the amounts as reported.\nNorTex Asset Purchase\nOn August 31, 2022, we purchased a group of assets in north Texas, primarily natural gas storage facilities and pipelines, from NorTex Midstream Holdings, LLC (NorTex Asset Purchase) for approximately $\n424\nmillion. These assets are included in the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment.\n97\nNote 4 – Related Party Transactions\nTransactions with Equity-Method Investees\nWe have expenses associated with our equity-method investees of $\n1.346\nbillion, $\n948\nmillion, and $\n348\nmillion for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Substantially all of these expenses are included in\nProduct costs\n. We also have revenue from our equity-method investees of $\n76\nmillion, $\n46\nmillion, and $\n26\nmillion for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In addition, w\ne have $\n17\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion included in\nAccounts receivable\nand $\n87\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion included in\nAccounts payable\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet\nwith our equity-method investees at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe have operating agreements with certain equity-method investees. These operating agreements typically provide for reimbursement or payment to us for certain direct operational payroll and employee benefit costs, materials, supplies, and other charges and also for management services. The total charges to equity-method investees for these fees are $\n65\nmillion, $\n70\nmillion, and $\n79\nmillion for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nBoard of Directors\nTwo members of our Board of Directors are also executive officers at certain of our counterparties. We recorded $\n180\nmillion in\nProduct sales\nand $\n86\nmillion in\nProduct costs\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income from these companies for the purchase and sale of natural gas for 2022.\n98\nNote 5 – Revenue Recognition\nRevenue by Category\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by major service line:\n99\n______________________________\n(1)\nRevenues not derived from contracts with customers primarily consist of physical product sales related to derivative contracts, realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with our derivative contracts, which are reported in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nin the Consolidated Statement of Income, management fees that we receive for certain services we provide to operated equity-method investments, and leasing revenues associated with our headquarters building.\n(2)\nOther adjustments reflect certain costs of Gas & NGL Marketing Services’ risk management activities. As we are acting as agent for natural gas marketing customers or engage in energy trading activities, the resulting revenues are presented net of the related costs of those activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income (see Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\nContract Assets\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our contract assets:\n100\nContract Liabilities\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our contract liabilities:\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations primarily include reservation charges on contracted capacity for our gas pipeline firm transportation contracts with customers, storage capacity contracts, long-term contracts containing minimum volume commitments associated with our midstream businesses, and fixed payments associated with offshore production handling. For our interstate natural gas pipeline businesses, remaining performance obligations reflect the rates for such services in our current FERC tariffs for the life of the related contracts; however, these rates may change based on future tariffs approved by the FERC and the amount and timing of these changes are not currently known.\nOur remaining performance obligations exclude variable consideration, including contracts with variable consideration for which we have elected the practical expedient for consideration recognized in revenue as billed. Certain of our contracts contain evergreen and other renewal provisions for periods beyond the initial term of the contract. The remaining performance obligation amounts as of December 31, 2022, do not consider potential future performance obligations for which the renewal has not been exercised and exclude contracts with customers for which the underlying facilities have not received FERC authorization to be placed into service. Consideration received prior to December 31, 2022, that will be recognized in future periods is also excluded from our remaining performance obligations and is instead reflected in contract liabilities.\nThe following table presents the amount of the contract liabilities balance expected to be recognized as revenue when performance obligations are satisfied and the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations under certain contracts as of December 31, 2022.\n101\nNote 6 – Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nincludes:\nReconciliations from the\nProvision (benefit) at statutory rate\nto recorded\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nare as follows:\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\nincludes less than $\n1\nmillion of foreign income in 2022, and $\n2\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion of foreign loss in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe\nState deferred income tax rate change\nbenefit of $\n92\nmillion is related to a decrease in our estimate of the deferred state income tax rate (net of federal effect) driven primarily by the enacted decline in the Pennsylvania state income tax rate over the next several years.\nDuring the course of audits of our business by domestic and foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the liability associated with our various filing positions, we apply the two-step process of recognition and measurement. In association with this liability, we record an estimate of related interest and tax exposure as a component of our tax provision. The impact of this accrual is included within\nOther – net\nin our reconciliation of the\nProvision (benefit) at statutory rate\nto recorded\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n.\n102\nSignificant components of\nDeferred income tax liabilities\nare as follows:\nThe valuation allowance at December 31, 2022 and 2021 serves to reduce the available deferred income tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. We considered all available positive and negative evidence, which incorporates available tax planning strategies, and management’s estimate of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and have determined that a portion of our deferred income tax assets related to the\nForeign tax credits\nand\nState losses and credits\nmay not be realized. In 2022, we released $\n70\nmillion of valuation allowance upon determining we expect to utilize additional foreign tax credits prior to expiration between 2024 and 2025. The amounts presented in the table above are, with respect to state items, before any federal benefit. The change from prior year for the\nState losses and credits\nreflects increases in losses and credits generated in the current and prior years less losses and/or credits utilized in the current year. We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple state taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire between 2023 and 2041 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.\nFederal loss carryovers\nat the end of 2022 include deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryovers of $\n705\nmillion with no expiration date. Deferred tax assets on charitable contributions of $\n25\nmillion are expected to be utilized by us prior to expiring between 2023 and 2027.\nCash payments for income taxes (net of refunds) were $\n13\nmillion in 2022. Cash refunds for income taxes (net of payments) were $\n45\nmillion and $\n40\nmillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we finalized settlements for 2011 through 2014 on certain contested matters with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that resulted in a 2022 year-to-date tax benefit of approximately $\n45\nmillion. In 2022, we received cash refunds related to these settlements totaling $\n7\nmillion.\nWe recognize related interest and penalties as a component of\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n. Total interest and penalties recognized as part of income tax provision were benefits of $\n3\nmillion in 2022 and $\n1\nmillion in each of 2021 and 2020. There are\nno\ninterest or penalties relating to uncertain tax positions accrued as of December 31, 2022 and $\n4\nmillion of interest was accrued as of December 31, 2021.\nConsolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns are open to IRS examination for years after 2017. As of December 31, 2022, examination of 2018 is currently in process, with the statute extended to September 30, 2023. We do not expect material changes in our financial position resulting from this examination. The statute of limitations for most states expires one year after expiration of the IRS statute.\n103\nNote 7 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nWe have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2019. Eligible employees earn compensation credits based on a cash balance formula. As of January 1, 2020, certain active employees are no longer eligible to receive compensation credits.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nWe provide subsidized retiree medical benefits to a closed group of participants as well as retiree life insurance benefits to eligible participants. Medical benefits for Medicare eligible participants are paid through contributions to health reimbursement accounts. Benefits for all other participants are provided through a self-insured medical plan, which includes participant contributions and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have a defined contribution plan for the benefit of substantially all employees. Plan participants may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax or after-tax basis. Generally, we match employee contributions up to\n6\npercent of eligible compensation. Additionally, eligible active employees that do not receive compensation credits under the defined benefit pension plan are eligible for an additional annual fixed-percentage contribution made by us to the defined contribution plan. Our contributions charged to expense were $\n53\nmillion in 2022, $\n45\nmillion in 2021, and $\n42\nmillion in 2020.\n104\nFunded Status\nThe following table presents the changes in benefit obligations and plan assets for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for the years indicated:\n____________\n(1)\n2022 amounts are due primarily to the following factors: Pension benefits - discount rate assumptions, partially offset by change in interest crediting rate assumption; Other Postretirement Benefits - discount rate assumption. 2021 amounts are due primarily to the following factors: Pension Benefits - discount rate assumptions, partially offset by experience-related items; Other Postretirement Benefits - discount rate assumption and experience-related items.\n105\nThe following table summarizes information for pension plans with obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31.\nPre-tax amounts recognized in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nat December 31 are as follows:\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have $\n130\nmillion and $\n150\nmillion, respectively, of pension and other postretirement plan amounts included in regulatory liabilities associated with our gas pipeline companies.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit)\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\nfor the years ended December 31 consist of the following:\n____________\n(1)\nComponents other than\nService cost\nare included in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nin the Consolidated Statement of Income\n.\n106\nItems Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nbefore taxes for the years ended December 31 consist of the following:\nKey Assumptions\nThe weighted-average assumptions utilized to determine benefit obligations and\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\nas of December 31 are as follows:\nWe use mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries to measure the benefit obligations.\nThe assumed health care cost trend rate for 2023 is\n6.8\npercent. This rate\ndecreases\nto\n4.5\npercent by\n2032\n.\nPlan Assets\nThe plans’ investment objectives include a framework to manage the volatility of the plans’ funded status and minimize future cash contributions. The plans follow a policy of diversifying the investments across various asset classes, strategies, and investment managers.\nThe investment policy for the pension plans includes target asset allocation percentages as well as permitted and prohibited investments designed to mitigate risks associated with investing. The December 31, 2022, target asset allocation was\n25\npercent equity securities and\n75\npercent fixed income securities, including investments in equity and fixed income mutual funds, commingled investment funds, and separate accounts.\n107\nThe fair values of our pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets by asset class at December 31 are as follows:\n____________\n(1)\nLevel 1 includes assets with fair values based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Cash management funds, equity securities traded on U.S. exchanges, U.S. Treasury securities, and mutual funds are included in this level.\n(2)\nLevel 2 includes assets with fair values determined by using significant other observable inputs. This level includes equity securities traded on active foreign exchanges and fixed income securities, other than U.S. Treasury securities, that are valued primarily using pricing models which incorporate observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads.\n(3)\nThe commingled investment funds are measured at fair value using net asset value per share. Certain standard withdrawal restrictions generally apply, which may include redemption notification period restrictions ranging from\n1\nday to\n15\ndays.\n108\nPlan Benefit Payments and Employer Contributions\nFollowing are the expected benefit payments, which reflect the same assumptions previously discussed and future service as appropriate.\nIn 2023, we expect to contribute approximately $\n1\nmillion to our pension plans and approximately $\n4\nmillion to our other postretirement benefit plan.\nNote 8 – Investing Activities\nInvestments\n___________\n(1)\nIncludes equity-method investments in multiple gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale region with an approximate average\n66\npercent interest.\nBasis differential\nThe carrying value of our Appalachia Midstream Investments exceeds our portion of the underlying net assets by approximately $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These differences were assigned at the acquisition date to property, plant, and equipment and customer relationship intangible assets. Certain of our other equity-method investments have a carrying value less than our portion of the underlying equity in the net assets primarily due to other than temporary impairments that we have recognized but that were not required to be recognized in the investees’ financial statements. These differences total approximately $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were assigned to property, plant, and equipment and customer relationship intangible assets. Differences in the carrying value of our equity-method investments and\n109\nour portion of the equity in the underlying net assets are generally amortized over the remaining useful lives of the associated underlying assets and included in\nEquity earnings (losses)\nwithin our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nPurchases of and contributions to equity-method investments\nWe generally fund our portion of significant expansion or development projects of these investees through additional capital contributions. These transactions increased the carrying value of our investments and included:\n___________\n(1)\nSee following discussion in the section\nAcquisition of additional interests in BRMH\nbelow.\nAcquisition of additional interests in BRMH\nAs of December 31, 2019, we effectively owned a\n29\npercent indirect interest in Blue Racer through our\n58\npercent interest in Blue Racer Midstream Holdings, LLC (BRMH), whose primary asset is a\n50\npercent interest in Blue Racer. In November 2020, we paid $\n157\nmillion, net of cash acquired, to acquire an additional\n41\npercent ownership interest in BRMH before acquiring the remaining interest of BRMH in September 2021. As such, we control and consolidate BRMH, reporting the\n50\npercent interest in Blue Racer as an equity-method investment. Since substantially all of the fair value of the BRMH assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, the investment in Blue Racer, and we previously held a noncontrolling interest in BRMH, we recorded the November 2020 and September 2021 additional purchases of interests as asset acquisitions. Prior to November 2021 BRMH was named Caiman Energy II, LLC and was accounted for as an equity-method investment.\nDividends and distributions\nThe organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of available cash to members on at least a quarterly basis. These transactions reduced the carrying value of our investments and included:\n___________\n(1)\nSee previous discussion in\nthe section\nAcquisition of additional interests in BRMH\nabove.\n110\nEquity Earnings (Losses)\nEquity earnings (losses)\nin 2020 includes a $\n78\nmillion loss associated with the first-quarter full impairment of goodwill recognized by our investee RMM, which was allocated entirely to our member interest per the terms of the membership agreement. Also included in 2020 are losses of $\n11\nmillion, $\n26\nmillion, and $\n10\nmillion for our share of asset impairments at Laurel Mountain, Appalachia Midstream Investments, and Blue Racer, respectively.\nImpairments of Equity-Method Investments\nSee Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk for information regarding impairments of our equity-method investments of $\n1,046\nmillion for 2020.\nSummarized Financial Position and Results of Operations of All Equity-Method Investments\nNote 9 – Property, Plant, and Equipment\nThe following table presents nonregulated and regulated\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nas presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the years ended:\n__________\n(1)    Estimated useful life and depreciation rates are presented as of December 31, 2022. Depreciation rates and estimated useful lives for regulated assets are prescribed by the FERC.\n111\nDepreciation and amortization expense for\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nwas $\n1.498\nbillion, $\n1.496\nbillion, and $\n1.393\nbillion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nRegulated\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nincludes approximately $\n428\nmillion and $\n468\nmillion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to amounts in excess of the original cost of the regulated facilities within our gas pipeline businesses as a result of our prior acquisitions. This amount is being amortized over\n40\nyears using the straight-line amortization method. Current FERC policy does not permit recovery through rates for amounts in excess of original cost of construction.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur accrued obligations primarily relate to offshore platforms and pipelines, oil and gas properties, gas transmission pipelines and facilities, underground storage caverns, gas processing, fractionation, and compression facilities, and gas gathering well connections and pipelines. At the end of the useful life of each respective asset, we are legally obligated to dismantle offshore platforms and appropriately abandon offshore pipelines, to remove certain components of gas transmission facilities from the ground, to restore land and remove surface equipment at gas processing, fractionation, and compression facilities, to cap certain gathering pipelines at the wellhead connection and remove any related surface equipment, to plug storage caverns and remove any related surface equipment, and to plug producing wells and remove any related surface equipment.\nThe following table presents the significant changes to our ARO, of which $\n1.827\nbillion and $\n1.590\nbillion are included in\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nwith the remaining current portion in\nAccrued and other current liabilities\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n___________\n(1)\nIncludes $\n307\nmillion of ARO in 2021 related to acquired upstream properties.\n(2)\nSeveral factors are considered in the annual review process, including inflation rates, current estimates for removal cost, market risk premiums, discount rates, and the estimated remaining useful life of the assets. The 2022 revisions reflect changes in removal cost estimates and increases in inflation rates, partially offset by increases in discount rates. The 2021 revisions reflect changes in removal cost estimates, increases in the estimated remaining useful life of certain assets, and increases in inflation rates.\nThe funds Transco collects through a portion of its rates to fund its ARO are deposited into an external trust account dedicated to funding its ARO (ARO Trust). (See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk.) Under its current rate settlement, Transco’s annual funding obligation is approximately $\n16\nmillion, with installments to be deposited monthly.\n112\nNote 10 – Intangible Assets\nThe gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets, included in\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet, at December 31 are as follows:\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer relationships primarily relate to gas gathering, processing, and fractionation contractual customer relationships recognized in acquisitions. Contractual customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of\n30\nyears for most acquisitions, which represents a portion of the term over which the contractual customer relationships are expected to contribute to our cash flows.\nWe expense costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of our gas gathering, processing, and fractionation contracts with customers. Although a significant portion of the expected future cash flows associated with these contractual customer relationships are dependent on our ability to renew or extend the arrangements beyond the initial contract periods, these expected future cash flows are significantly influenced by the scope and pace of our producer customers’ drilling programs. Once producer customers’ wells are connected to our gathering infrastructure, their likelihood of switching to another provider before the wells are abandoned is reduced due to the significant capital investment required.\nThe amortization expense related to customer relationships was $\n353\nmillion, $\n332\nmillion, and $\n328\nmillion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five succeeding fiscal years is approximately $\n357\nmillion.\nTransportation and Storage Capacity Contracts\nCertain transportation and storage capacity contracts were recognized as intangible assets as part of the Sequent Acquisition. (See Note 3 – Acquisitions.) The amortization expense related to transportation and storage capacity contracts was $\n158\nmillion in 2022 and $\n14\nmillion in 2021. The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five succeeding fiscal years is $\n51\nmillion, $\n21\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion, and $\n4\nmillion.\n113\nNote 11 – Accrued and Other Current Liabilities\n114\nNote 12 – Debt and Banking Arrangements\nLong-Term Debt\n115\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to create liens supporting indebtedness, sell assets, and incur additional debt. Default of these agreements could also restrict our ability to make certain distributions or repurchase equity.\nThe following table presents aggregate minimum maturities of long-term debt and other financing obligations, excluding net unamortized debt premium (discount) and debt issuance costs, for each of the next five years:\nIssuances and retirements\nOn October 17, 2022, we early retired $\n850\nmillion of\n3.7\npercent senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2023.\nOn August 8, 2022, we issued $\n1.0\nbillion of\n4.65\npercent senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2032, and $\n750\nmillion of\n5.30\npercent senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2052.\nOn May 16, 2022, we early retired $\n750\nmillion of\n3.35\npercent senior unsecured notes due August 15, 2022.\nOn January 18, 2022, we early retired $\n1.25\nbillion of\n3.6\npercent senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2022.\nOn October 8, 2021, we completed a public offering of $\n600\nmillion of\n2.6\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2031. The new 2031 notes are an additional issuance of the $\n900\nmillion of\n2.6\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2031 issued on March 2, 2021, and will trade interchangeably with such notes. Also, on October 8, 2021, we completed a public offering of $\n650\nmillion of\n3.5\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2051.\nWe retired $\n371\nmillion of\n7.875\npercent senior unsecured notes that matured on September 1, 2021.\nOn August 16, 2021, we early retired $\n500\nmillion of\n4.0\npercent senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2021.\nOn August 17, 2020, we early retired $\n600\nmillion of\n4.125\npercent senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2020.\nOn May 14, 2020, we completed a public offering of $\n1\nbillion of\n3.5\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2030.\nOn May 8, 2020, Transco issued $\n700\nmillion of\n3.25\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2030 and $\n500\nmillion of\n3.95\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2050 to investors in a private debt placement. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Transco filed a registration statement and completed an exchange of these notes for substantially identical new notes that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nWe retired $\n1.5\nbillion of\n5.25\npercent senior unsecured notes that matured on March 15, 2020.\nWe retired $\n14\nmillion of\n8.75\npercent senior unsecured notes that matured on January 15, 2020.\nOther financing obligations\nDuring the construction of the Atlantic Sunrise, Leidy South, and Dalton projects, Transco received funding from co-owners for their proportionate share of construction costs. Amounts received were recorded within\n116\nnoncurrent liabilities and the costs associated with construction were capitalized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon placing these projects into service Transco began utilizing the co-owners’ undivided interest in the assets, including the associated pipeline capacity, and reclassified the funding previously received from its co-owners from noncurrent liabilities to debt. The obligations, which mature in 2038, 2041, and 2052, respectively, require monthly interest and principal payments and bear interest rates of approximately\n9\npercent,\n13\npercent, and\n9\npercent, respectively.\nCredit Facility\n________________\n(1)    In managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of our credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program.\nRevolving credit facility\nIn October 2021, we along with Transco and Northwest Pipeline, the lenders named therein, and an administrative agent entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (Credit Agreement) that reduced aggregate commitments available from $\n4.5\nbillion to $\n3.75\nbillion, with up to an additional $\n500\nmillion increase in aggregate commitments available under certain circumstances. The Credit Agreement was effective on October 8, 2021. The maturity date of the credit facility is October 8, 2026. However, the co-borrowers may request up to two extensions of the maturity date each for an additional one-year period to allow a maturity date as late as October 8, 2028, under certain circumstances. The Credit Agreement allows for swing line loans up to an aggregate of $\n200\nmillion, subject to available capacity under the credit facility, and letters of credit commitments of $\n500\nmillion. Transco and Northwest Pipeline are each able to borrow up to $\n500\nmillion under this credit facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by the other co-borrowers.\nThe Credit Agreement contains the following terms and conditions:\n•\nVarious covenants may limit, among other things, a borrower’s and its material subsidiaries’ ability to grant certain liens supporting indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell all or substantially all of its assets in certain circumstances, make certain distributions during an event of default, and each borrower and each borrower’s respective material subsidiaries’ ability to enter into certain restrictive agreements.\n•\nIf an event of default with respect to a borrower occurs under the credit facility, the lenders will be able to terminate the commitments for the respective borrowers and accelerate the maturity of the loans of the defaulting borrower under the credit facility and exercise other rights and remedies.\n•\nOther than swing line loans, each time funds are borrowed, the applicable borrower may choose from two methods of calculating interest: a fluctuating base rate equal to an alternative base rate as defined in the Credit Agreement plus an applicable margin or a periodic fixed rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing schedule based on the applicable borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt ratings and the commitment fee is determined by reference to a pricing schedule based on Williams’ senior unsecured long-term debt ratings. The Credit Agreement also includes customary provisions to provide for replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate when LIBOR ceases to be available.\n117\nSignificant financial covenants under the Credit Agreement require the ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), each as defined in the Credit Agreement, to be no greater than\n5.0\nto 1.0, except that for any fiscal quarter in which the funding of the purchase price for an acquisition (whether effectuated as one or a series of related transactions) with an aggregate purchase price of $\n25\nmillion or more has been effected, and the following two fiscal quarters (in each case subject to certain limitations), the ratio of debt to EBITDA is to be no greater than\n5.5\nto 1.\nThe ratio of debt to capitalization (defined as net worth plus debt), each as defined in the Credit Agreement,  must be no greater than\n65\npercent for each of Transco and Northwest Pipeline.\nAt December 31, 2022, we are in compliance with these covenants.\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn 2018, we entered into a $\n4\nbillion commercial paper program that has been reduced to $\n3.5\nbillion in connection with the October 2021 Credit Agreement. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary but may not exceed\n397\ndays from the date of issuance. The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The net proceeds of issuances of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used to fund planned capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2022, $\n350\nmillion of commercial paper was outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of\n4.8\npercent. We had\nno\ncommercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021.\nCash Payments for Interest (Net of Amounts Capitalized)\nCash payments for interest (net of amounts capitalized)\nwere $\n1.117\nbillion in 2022, $\n1.137\nbillion in 2021, and $\n1.149\nbillion in 2020.\n118\nNote 13 – Leases\nWe are a lessee through noncancellable lease agreements for property and equipment consisting primarily of buildings, land, vehicles, and equipment used in both our operations and administrative functions.\nAt December 31, 2022, the following table represents our operating lease maturities, including renewal provisions that we have assessed as being reasonably certain of exercise, for each of the years ended December 31:\nWe are the lessor to certain lease agreements for office space in our headquarters building, which are insignificant to our financial statements.\nNote 14 – Equity-Based Compensation\nWilliams’ Plan Information\nThe Williams Companies, Inc. 2007 Incentive Plan (the Plan) provides common-stock-based awards to both employees and nonmanagement directors. To date,\n50\nmillion new shares have been authorized for making awards under the Plan, including\n10\nmillion shares added on April 28, 2020. The Plan permits the granting of various types of awards including, but not limited to, restricted stock units and stock options. At December 31, 2022,\n25\nmillion\n119\nshares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to existing and future stock awards, of which\n15\nmillion shares were available for future grants.\nAdditionally, up to\n5.2\nmillion new shares of our common stock have been authorized to date to be available for sale under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), including\n1.6\nmillion shares added on April 28, 2020. Employees purchased\n242\nthousand shares at a weighted-average price of $\n24.57\nper share during 2022. Approximately\n1.2\nmillion shares were available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2022.\nWe recognize compensation expense on employee stock-based awards on a straight-line basis; forfeitures are recognized when they occur.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nand\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income include equity-based compensation expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020 of $\n73\nmillion,\n$\n81\nmillion, and $\n52\nmillion, respectively. Income tax benefit recognized related to the stock-based compensation expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $\n18\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion, and $\n13\nmillion, respectively. Measured but unrecognized stock-based compensation expense at December 31, 2022, was $\n63\nmillion, all of which related to restricted stock units. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.7\nyears.\nNonvested Restricted Stock Units\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had restricted stock units outstanding, including performance-based shares, of\n6.9\nmillion shares and\n7.3\nmillion shares, respectively, with a weighted-average fair value of $\n23.63\nand $\n22.35\n, respectively. Restricted stock units generally vest after\nthree years\n. Performance-based grants may vest at a range from\nzero percent\nto\n200\npercent of the original shares granted based on performance against a target. At December 31, 2022, there were\n2.6\nmillion performance-based shares outstanding.\nStock Options\nThere were\nno\nstock options granted in 2022, 2021, or 2020. At December 31, 2022, we had\n2.8\nmillion stock options that were both outstanding and exercisable, with a weighted-average exercise price of $\n34.32\n. The weighted-average remaining contractual life for stock options that were both outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2022, was\n2.8\nyears. Cash received for the exercise of stock options in 2022 was $\n49\nmillion, and the related income tax benefit recognized in 2022 was $\n2\nmillion.\n120\nNote 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk\nThe following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, certain of our significant financial assets and liabilities. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and commercial paper approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Therefore, these assets and liabilities are not presented in the following table.\n(1)\nNet commodity derivative assets and liabilities exclude $\n202\nmillion of net cash collateral in Level 1.\n(2)\nNet commodity derivative assets and liabilities exclude $\n296\nmillion of net cash collateral in Level 1.\nFair Value Methods\nWe use the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments:\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nARO Trust investments\n:\nTransco deposits a portion of its collected rates, pursuant to its rate case settlement, into an external trust that is specifically designated to fund future ARO’s. The ARO Trust invests in a portfolio of actively traded mutual funds that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted prices in an active market and is reported in\nRegulatory assets, deferred charges, and other\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are ultimately recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities.\n121\nCommodity derivatives\n:\nCommodity derivatives include exchange-traded contracts and OTC contracts, which consist of physical forwards, futures, and swaps that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We also have other derivatives related to asset management agreements and other contracts that require physical delivery. Derivatives classified as Level 1 are valued using New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures prices. Derivatives classified as Level 2 are valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. These transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers. Derivatives classified as Level 3 are valued using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The fair value amounts are presented on a net basis and reflect the netting of asset and liability positions permitted under the terms of our master netting arrangements and cash held on deposit in margin accounts that we have received or remitted to collateralize certain derivative positions. Commodity derivative assets are reported in\nDerivative assets\nand\nRegulatory assets, deferred charges, and other\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Commodity derivative liabilities are reported in\nDerivative liabilities\nand\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities are recorded in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nand\nNet processing commodity expenses\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nSee Note 16 – Derivatives for additional information on our derivatives.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of changes in fair value of our net commodity derivatives classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nA substantial portion of the carrying value of our Level 3 derivatives at December 31, 2022, relates to a long-term physical natural gas purchase contract associated with an ongoing pipeline expansion project. The valuation of this contract reflects the extrapolation of forward natural gas prices for periods beyond observable price curves, which is considered a significant unobservable input.\nAdditional fair value disclosures\nLong-term debt, including current portion\n:\nThe disclosed fair value of our long-term debt is determined primarily by a market approach using broker quoted indicative period-end bond prices. The quoted prices are based on observable transactions in less active markets for our debt or similar instruments.  The fair values of the financing obligations associated with our Dalton, Leidy South, and Atlantic Sunrise projects, which are included within long-term debt, were determined using an income approach (see Note 12 – Debt and Banking Arrangements).\nGuarantees\n:\nGuarantees primarily consist of a guarantee we have provided in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group (WilTel), on a lease performance obligation that extends through 2042. Guarantees also include an indemnification related to a disposed operation.\nTo estimate the fair value of the WilTel guarantee, an estimated default rate is applied to the sum of the future contractual lease payments using an income approach. The estimated default rate is determined by obtaining the average cumulative issuer-weighted corporate default rate based on the credit rating of WilTel’s current owner and the term of the underlying obligation. The default rate is published by Moody’s Investors Service. The carrying\n122\nvalue of the WilTel guarantee is reported in\nAccrued and other current liabilities\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The maximum potential undiscounted exposure is approximately $\n24\nmillion at December 31, 2022. Our exposure declines systematically through the remaining term of WilTel’s obligation.\nThe fair value of the guarantee associated with the indemnification related to a disposed operation was estimated using an income approach that considered probability-weighted scenarios of potential levels of future performance.  The terms of the indemnification do not limit the maximum potential future payments associated with the guarantee. The carrying value of this guarantee is reported in\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe are required by our revolving credit agreement to indemnify lenders for certain taxes required to be withheld from payments due to the lenders and for certain tax payments made by the lenders. The maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnifications is based on the related borrowings and such future payments cannot currently be determined. These indemnifications generally continue indefinitely unless limited by the underlying tax regulations and have\nno\ncarrying value. We have never been called upon to perform under these indemnifications and have no current expectation of a future claim.\nNonrecurring fair value measurements\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we observed a significant decline in the publicly traded price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, which declined\n40\npercent during the quarter, including a\n26\npercent decline in the month of March. These changes were generally attributed to macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including significant declines in crude oil prices driven by both surplus supply and a decrease in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. As a result of these conditions, we performed an interim assessment of the goodwill associated with our Northeast G&P reporting unit as of March 31, 2020.\nThe assessment considered the total fair value of the businesses within the Northeast G&P reporting unit, which was determined using income and market approaches. We utilized internally developed industry weighted-average discount rates and estimates of valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded gathering and processing companies. In assessing the fair value as of the March 31, 2020, measurement date, we were required to consider recent publicly available indications of value, which included lower observed publicly traded EBITDA market multiples as compared with recent history and significantly higher industry weighted-average discount rates. The fair value of the reporting unit was further reconciled to our estimated total enterprise value as of March 31, 2020, which considered observable valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies applied to each distinct business including the Northeast G&P reporting unit. This assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of the Northeast G&P reporting unit was below its carrying value, including goodwill. As a result of this Level 3 measurement, we recognized a full impairment charge of $\n187\nmillion as of March 31, 2020, in\nImpairment of goodwill\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income. Our partner’s $\n65\nmillion share of this impairment is reflected within\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income.\n123\nThe following table presents impairments of assets and equity-method investments associated with certain nonrecurring fair value measurements within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, except as specifically noted.\n______________\n(1)\nRelates to capitalized project development costs for the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. Approvals required for the project from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection have been denied and we have not refiled at this time. Beginning in May 2020, we discontinued capitalization of costs related to this project. Considering that the customer precedent agreements and FERC certificate for the project remain in effect, we had previously concluded that the probability of completing the project was sufficient to not require impairment. However, developments in the political and regulatory environments caused us to slightly lower that assessed probability such that the capitalized project costs required impairment. The estimated fair value of the materials within the capitalized project costs at December 31, 2020 considered other internal uses and salvage values for the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\n. The remaining capitalized costs were determined to have no fair value. The estimated fair value of certain capitalized project costs at June 30, 2021, was determined by a market approach, which incorporated an indication of interest by a third-party.\n(2)\nRelates to a gathering system in the Marcellus Shale region, that was sold in 2021. The estimated fair value of the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nand\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nwas determined using a market approach, which incorporated an indication of interest by a third party. These inputs resulted in a fair value measurement within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n124\n(3)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, RMM renegotiated service contracts with a significant customer in connection with the customer’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The renegotiated contracts result in lower service rates and lower projected future cash flows. As a result, we evaluated this investment for other-than-temporary impairment.  The fair value was measured using an income approach.  We utilized a discount rate of\n18\npercent in our analysis\n.\n(4)\nFollowing the previously described declining market conditions during the first quarter of 2020, we evaluated these investments for other-than-temporary impairment. The fair value was measured using an income approach. Both investees operate in primarily oil-driven basins where significant expected reductions in producer activities led to reduced estimates of expected future cash flows. Our fair value estimates also reflected discount rates of approximately\n17\npercent for these investments. We also considered any debt held at the investee level, and its impact to fair value. The industry weighted-average discount rates utilized were significantly influenced by the market declines previously discussed.\n(5)\nFollowing the previously described declining market conditions during the first quarter of 2020, we evaluated these investments for other-than-temporary impairment.  The impairments within our Northeast G&P segment are primarily associated with operations in wet-gas areas where producer drilling activities are influenced by NGL prices which historically trend with crude oil prices. The fair values of our investments in BRMH and Aux Sable Liquid Products LP (Aux Sable) were estimated using a market approach, reflecting valuation multiples ranging from\n5.0\nx to\n6.2\nx EBITDA (weighted-average\n6.0\nx). The fair values of the other investments, including gathering systems that are part of Appalachia Midstream Investments, were estimated using an income approach, with discount rates ranging from\n9.7\npercent to\n13.5\npercent (weighted-average\n12.6\npercent). We also considered any debt held at the investee level, and its impact to fair value. The assumed valuation multiples and industry weighted-average discount rates utilized were both significantly influenced by the market declines previously discussed.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nAccounts receivable\nThe following table summarizes concentration of receivables, net of allowances:\nCustomers include producers, distribution companies, industrial users, gas marketers, and pipelines primarily located in the continental United States. As a general policy, collateral is not required for receivables with the exception of the marketing receivables discussed below. Customers’ financial condition and credit worthiness are evaluated regularly and, based upon this evaluation, we may obtain collateral to support receivables.\nWe use established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of gas marketing and trading counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade\n125\nfinancial institution, but may also include U.S. government securities. We also utilize netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to gas marketing and trading counterparty credit risk. When more than one derivative transaction with the same counterparty is outstanding and a legally enforceable netting agreement exists with that counterparty, the “net” mark-to-market exposure represents a reasonable measure of our credit risk with that counterparty.\nNote 16 – Derivatives\nCommodity-Related Derivatives\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk. To manage this volatility, we use various contracts in our marketing and trading activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, value at risk. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a net basis by counterparty, net of margin deposits. See Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk for additional fair value information. In our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, any cash impacts of settled commodity-related derivatives are recorded as operating activities.\nWe enter into commodity-related derivatives to economically hedge exposures to natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil and retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2022, the notional volume of the net long (short) positions for our commodity-related derivative contracts were as follows:\nDerivative Financial Statement Presentation\nThe fair value of commodity-related derivatives, which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, was reflected as follows:\n126\nThe pre-tax effects of commodity-related derivative instruments in\nNet gain (loss) on commodity derivatives\nreflected within\nTotal revenues\nand\nNet processing commodity expenses\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income were as follows:\nContingent Features\nGenerally, collateral may be provided by a parent guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. If collateral is required, fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral are offset against fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty.\nWe have specific trade and credit contracts that contain minimum credit rating requirements. These credit rating requirements typically give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings are downgraded to non-investment grade status. Under such circumstances, we would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with these counterparties. At December 31, 2022, the contractually required collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade to non-investment grade status was $\n13\nmillion.\nWe maintain accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain exchanges to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, we may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, net cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $\n202\nmillion and $\n296\nmillion, respectively.\nNote 17 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments\nAlaska Refinery Contamination Litigation\nWe are involved in litigation arising from our ownership and operation of the North Pole Refinery in North Pole, Alaska, from 1980 until 2004, through our wholly owned subsidiaries Williams Alaska Petroleum Inc. (WAPI) and MAPCO Inc. We sold the refinery to Flint Hills Resources Alaska, LLC (FHRA), a subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., in 2004. The litigation involves three cases, with filing dates ranging from 2010 to 2014. The actions primarily arise from sulfolane contamination allegedly emanating from the refinery. A putative class action lawsuit was filed by James West in 2010 naming us, WAPI, and FHRA as defendants. We and FHRA filed claims against each other seeking, among other things, contractual indemnification alleging that the other party caused the sulfolane contamination. In 2011, we and FHRA settled the claim with James West. Certain claims by FHRA against us were resolved by the Alaska Supreme Court in our favor. FHRA’s claims against us for contractual indemnification and statutory claims for damages related to off-site sulfolane were remanded to the Alaska Superior\n127\nCourt. The State of Alaska filed its action in March 2014, seeking damages. The City of North Pole (North Pole) filed its lawsuit in November 2014, seeking past and future damages, as well as punitive damages. Both we and WAPI asserted counterclaims against the State of Alaska and North Pole, and cross-claims against FHRA. FHRA has also filed cross-claims against us.\nThe underlying factual basis and claims in the cases are similar and may duplicate exposure. As such, in February 2017, the three cases were consolidated into one action in state court containing the remaining claims from the James West case and those of the State of Alaska and North Pole. The State of Alaska later announced the discovery of additional contaminants per- and polyfluoralkyl (PFOS and PFOA) offsite of the refinery, and the court permitted the State of Alaska to amend its complaint to add a claim for offsite PFOS/PFOA contamination. The court subsequently remanded the offsite PFOS/PFOA claims to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation for investigation and stayed the claims pending their potential resolution at the administrative agency. Several trial dates encompassing all three cases have been scheduled and stricken. In the summer of 2019, the court deconsolidated the cases for purposes of trial. A bench trial on all claims except North Pole’s claims began in October 2019.\nIn January 2020, the Alaska Superior Court issued its Memorandum of Decision finding in favor of the State of Alaska and FHRA, with the total incurred and potential future damages estimated to be $\n86\nmillion. The court found that FHRA is not entitled to contractual indemnification from us because FHRA contributed to the sulfolane contamination. On March 23, 2020, the court entered final judgment in the case. Filing deadlines were stayed until May 1, 2020. However, on April 21, 2020, we filed a Notice of Appeal. We also filed post-judgment motions including a Motion for New Trial and a Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment. These post-trial motions were resolved with the court’s denial of the last motion on June 11, 2020. Our Statement of Points on Appeal was filed on July 13, 2020. On June 22, 2020, the court stayed the North Pole’s case pending resolution of the appeal in the State of Alaska and FHRA case. On December 23, 2020, we filed our opening brief on appeal. Oral argument was held on December 15, 2021. We have recorded an accrued liability in the amount of our estimate of the probable loss. It is reasonably possible that we may not be successful on appeal and could ultimately pay up to the amount of judgment.\nRoyalty Matters\nCertain of our customers, including Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake), have been named in various lawsuits alleging underpayment of royalties and claiming, among other things, violations of anti-trust laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. We have also been named as a defendant in certain of these cases filed in Pennsylvania based on allegations that we improperly participated with Chesapeake in causing the alleged royalty underpayments. We believe that the claims asserted are subject to indemnity obligations owed to us by Chesapeake. Chesapeake has reached a settlement to resolve substantially all Pennsylvania royalty cases pending, which settlement applies to both Chesapeake and us. The settlement does not require any contribution from us. On August 23, 2021, the court approved the settlement, but two objectors filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\nLitigation Against Energy Transfer and Related Parties\nOn April 6, 2016, we filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (Energy Transfer) and LE GP, LLC (the general partner for Energy Transfer) alleging willful and material breaches of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (ETE Merger Agreement) with Energy Transfer resulting from the private offering by Energy Transfer on March 8, 2016, of Series A Convertible Preferred Units (Special Offering) to certain Energy Transfer insiders and other accredited investors. The suit seeks, among other things, an injunction ordering the defendants to unwind the Special Offering and to specifically perform their obligations under the ETE Merger Agreement. On April 19, 2016, we filed an amended complaint seeking the same relief. On May 3, 2016, Energy Transfer and LE GP, LLC filed an answer and counterclaims.\nOn May 13, 2016, we filed a separate complaint in Delaware Chancery Court against Energy Transfer, LE GP, LLC and the other Energy Transfer affiliates that are parties to the ETE Merger Agreement, alleging material\n128\nbreaches of the ETE Merger Agreement for failing to cooperate and use necessary efforts to obtain a tax opinion required under the ETE Merger Agreement (Tax Opinion) and for otherwise failing to use necessary efforts to consummate the merger under the ETE Merger Agreement wherein we would be merged with and into the newly formed Energy Transfer Corp LP (ETC) (ETC Merger). The suit sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment and injunction preventing Energy Transfer from terminating or otherwise avoiding its obligations under the ETE Merger Agreement due to any failure to obtain the Tax Opinion.\nThe Court of Chancery coordinated the Special Offering and Tax Opinion suits. On May 20, 2016, the Energy Transfer defendants filed amended affirmative defenses and verified counterclaims in the Special Offering and Tax Opinion suits, alleging certain breaches of the ETE Merger Agreement by us and seeking, among other things, a declaration that we were not entitled to specific performance, that Energy Transfer could terminate the ETC Merger, and that Energy Transfer is entitled to a $\n1.48\nbillion termination fee. On June 24, 2016, following a two-day trial, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying our requested relief in the Tax Opinion suit. The court did not rule on the substance of our claims related to the Special Offering or on the substance of Energy Transfer’s counterclaims. On June 27, 2016, we filed an appeal of the court’s decision with the Supreme Court of Delaware, seeking reversal and remand to pursue damages. On March 23, 2017, the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the Court of Chancery’s ruling. On March 30, 2017, we filed a motion for reargument with the Supreme Court of Delaware, which was denied on April 5, 2017.\nOn September 16, 2016, we filed an amended complaint with the Court of Chancery seeking damages for breaches of the ETE Merger Agreement by defendants. On September 23, 2016, Energy Transfer filed a second amended and supplemental affirmative defenses and verified counterclaim with the Court of Chancery seeking, among other things, payment of the $\n1.48\nbillion termination fee due to our alleged breaches of the ETE Merger Agreement. On December 1, 2017, the court granted our motion to dismiss certain of Energy Transfer’s counterclaims, including its claim seeking payment of the $\n1.48\nbillion termination fee. On December 8, 2017, Energy Transfer filed a motion for reargument, which the Court of Chancery denied on April 16, 2018. Trial was held May 10 through May 17, 2021. On December 29, 2021, the court entered judgment in our favor in the amount of $\n410\nmillion, plus interest at the contractual rate, and our reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. On September 21, 2022, the court entered a final order and judgment awarding us the termination fee, attorney’s fees, expenses, and interest in the amount of $\n602\nmillion plus additional interest starting September 17, 2022. Energy Transfer has appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own. We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred, or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental laws. As of December 31, 2022, we have accrued liabilities totaling $\n40\nmillion\nfor these matters, as discussed below. Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. At December 31, 2022, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other governmental authorities, and other factors.\nThe EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely propose and promulgate new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, reviews and updates to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and rules for new and existing source performance standards for volatile\n129\norganic compound and methane. We continuously monitor these regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. Implementation of new or modified regulations may result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas; however, due to regulatory uncertainty on final rule content and applicability timeframes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of these regulatory impacts at this time.\nContinuing operations\nOur interstate gas pipelines are involved in remediation and monitoring activities related to certain facilities and locations for polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, and other hazardous substances. These activities have involved the EPA and various state environmental authorities, resulting in our identification as a potentially responsible party at various Superfund waste sites. At December 31, 2022, we have accrued liabilities of $\n13\nmillion for these costs and expect to recover approximately $\n4\nmillion through rates.\nWe also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2022, we have accrued liabilities totaling $\n10\nmillion for these costs.\nFormer operations\nWe have potential obligations in connection with assets and businesses we no longer operate. These potential obligations include remediation activities at the direction of federal and state environmental authorities and the indemnification of the purchasers of certain of these assets and businesses for environmental and other liabilities existing at the time the sale was consummated. Our responsibilities relate to the operations of the assets and businesses described below.\n•\nFormer agricultural fertilizer and chemical operations and former retail petroleum and refining operations;\n•\nFormer petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;\n•\nFormer petroleum refining facilities;\n•\nFormer exploration and production and mining operations;\n•\nFormer electricity and natural gas marketing and trading operations.\nAt December 31, 2022, we have accrued environmental liabilities of $\n17\nmillion related to these matters.\nOther Divestiture Indemnifications\nPursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions and are contingent upon the purchasers incurring liabilities that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The indemnities generally relate to breach of warranties, tax, historic litigation, personal injury, property damage, environmental matters, right of way, and other representations that we have provided.\nAt December 31, 2022, other than as previously disclosed, we are not aware of any material claims against us involving the above-described indemnities; thus, we do not expect any of the indemnities provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a material impact on our future financial position. Any claim for indemnity brought against us in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the claim is made.\n130\nIn addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are pending against us that are incidental to our operations, none of which are expected to be material to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.\nSummary\nWe have disclosed our estimated range of reasonably possible losses for certain matters above, as well as all significant matters for which we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. We estimate that for all other matters for which we are able to reasonably estimate a range of loss, our aggregate reasonably possible losses beyond amounts accrued are immaterial to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. These calculations have been made without consideration of any potential recovery from third parties.\nCommitments\nCommitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant, and equipment are approximately $\n439\nmillion at December 31, 2022.\nCommitments for Gas & NGL Marketing Services pipeline transportation capacity and storage capacity are approximately $\n546\nmillion at December 31, 2022.\nNote 18 – Segment Disclosures\nOur reportable segments are Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, West, and Gas & NGL Marketing Services. All remaining business activities are included in Other. (See Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.)\nPerformance Measurement\nWe evaluate segment operating performance based upon\nModified EBITDA\n. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is the primary performance measure used by our chief operating decision maker in measuring performance and allocating resources among our reportable segments. Intersegment\nService revenues\nprimarily represent transportation services provided to our marketing business and gathering services provided to our oil and gas properties. Intersegment\nProduct sales\nprimarily represent the sale of natural gas and NGLs from our natural gas processing plants and our oil and gas properties to our marketing business.\nWe define\nModified EBITDA\nas follows:\n•\nNet income (loss) before:\n◦\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes;\n◦\nInterest incurred, net of interest capitalized;\n◦\nEquity earnings (losses);\n◦\nImpairment of equity-method investments;\n◦\nOther investing income (loss)\n–\nnet;\n◦\nImpairment of goodwill;\n◦\nDepreciation and amortization expenses;\n◦\nAccretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations.\n•\nThis measure is further adjusted to include our proportionate share (based on ownership interest) of\nModified EBITDA\nfrom our equity-method investments calculated consistently with the definition described above.\n131\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of\nModified EBITDA\nto\nNet income (loss)\nas reported in our Consolidated Statement of Income:\n____________\n(1)\nModified EBITDA\nfor 2022, 2021, and 2020, includes charges of $\n161\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion, and $\n17\nmillion respectively, associated with lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments to our inventory. These charges are reflected in\nProduct Sales\nor\nProduct costs\nin our Consolidated Statement of Income (see Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n)\n. Net unrealized commodity-related derivatives gains of $\n47\nmillion in 2022 and $\n0\nin 2021 and 2020 are reflected in\nNet processing commodity expenses.\n132\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of\nSegment revenues\nto\nTotal revenues\nas reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income and\nOther financial information\n:\n133\n______________\n(1)\nSee Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\n(2)\nWe record transactions that qualify as derivatives at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the period of change and characterized as unrealized gains or losses. Gains and losses on derivatives held for energy trading purposes are presented on a net basis in revenue.\nSegment assets include\nInvestments\n,\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net,\nand\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\n.

    "text": "Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) or our internal control over financial reporting (Internal Controls) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions warrant.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and board of directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n137\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013). Based on our assessment, we concluded that, at December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nErnst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n138\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nThe Williams Companies, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited The Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nFebruary 27, 2023\n139"
