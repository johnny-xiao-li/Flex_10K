    "text": "OVERVIEW\nMarathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) has over 130 years of experience in the energy business, and is the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and midstream business in the United States. We operate the nation's largest refining system with approximately 2.9 million barrels per day of crude oil refining capacity and believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers in the United States. We also operate Speedway, the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, which we have agreed to sell to 7-Eleven, Inc. (“7-Eleven”) for $21 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. We distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the United States and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. In addition, our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets.\nOur operations consist of two reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers.\n•\nRefining & Marketing – refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our refineries in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided largely by our Midstream segment. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily Marathon\n®\nbranded outlets, through long-term supply contracts with direct dealers who operate locations mainly under the ARCO\n®\nbrand and to approximately 3,800 Speedway locations.\n•\nMidstream – transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the Refining & Marketing segment via refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats and barges; gathers, processes and transports natural gas; and gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs. The Midstream segment primarily reflects the results of MPLX LP (“MPLX”). MPLX is a diversified, large-cap master limited partnership (“MLP”) formed in 2012 that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets and provides fuels distribution services. As of December 31, 2020, we owned the general partner of MPLX and approximately 62 percent of the outstanding MPLX common units.\nCorporate History and Structure\nMPC was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon Oil”). On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its Refining, Marketing & Transportation Business into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil on June 30, 2011. Our common stock trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “MPC.”\nOn October 1, 2018, we acquired Andeavor. Andeavor shareholders received in the aggregate approximately 239.8 million shares of MPC common stock valued at $19.8 billion and $3.5 billion in cash. Andeavor was a highly integrated marketing, logistics and refining company operating primarily in the Western and Mid-Continent United States. Our acquisition of Andeavor in 2018 substantially increased our geographic diversification and the scale of our assets, which provides increased opportunities to optimize our system.\nRecent Developments\nStrategic Actions to Enhance Shareholder Value\nSpeedway Sale\nOn August 2, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven for $21 billion in cash,\n4\nsubject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. This transaction is expected to result in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $16.5 billion. We expect to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.\nIn connection with the agreement to sell Speedway, we have agreed to enter into certain ancillary agreements, including a 15-year fuel supply agreement associated with 7-Eleven or its subsidiaries, depending on the fuel demand of Speedway and other factors to be set forth in the fuel supply agreement. Further, we expect incremental opportunities over time to supply 7-Eleven's remaining business as 7-Eleven's existing arrangements mature and as new locations are added in connection with its announced U.S. and Canada growth strategy.\nAs a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, its results are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and its assets and liabilities have been reclassified in our consolidated balance sheets to assets and liabilities held for sale. Prior to presentation of Speedway as discontinued operations, Speedway and our retained direct dealer business were the two reporting units within our Retail segment. Beginning with the third quarter of 2020, the direct dealer business is managed as part of the Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Refining & Marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented.\nAs a result of our agreement to sell Speedway, the following changes in our basis of presentation have occurred:\n•\nIn accordance with ASC 205, Discontinued Operations, intersegment sales from our Refining & Marketing segment to Speedway are no longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue, since we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway subsequent to the sale to 7-Eleven. All periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change.\n•\nBeginning August 2, 2020, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway’s property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use lease assets.\nMidstream Review\nOn March 18, 2020, we announced that MPC’s board of directors unanimously decided to maintain MPC’s current midstream structure, with MPC remaining, through a wholly owned subsidiary, the general partner of MPLX. This decision concluded a comprehensive evaluation, led by a special committee of the board, that included extensive input from multiple external advisors and significant feedback from investors.\nOUR OPERATIONS\nOur operations consist of two reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing and Midstream.\nREFINING & MARKETING\nRefineries\nWe currently own and operate refineries in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast regions of the United States with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of 2,874 mbpcd. During 2020, our refineries processed 2,418 mbpd of crude oil and 165 mbpd of other charge and blendstocks. During 2019, our refineries processed 2,902 mbpd of crude oil and 210 mbpd of other charge and blendstocks.\nOur refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, coking, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of condensate and light and heavy crude oils purchased from various domestic and foreign suppliers. We produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with ethanol and ULSD fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, propane, propylene and sulfur. See the Refined Product Marketing section for further information about the products we produce.\n5\nOur refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and efficiently utilize our processing capacity. Also, shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns allows us to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work.\nFollowing is a description of each of our refineries and their capacity by region.\nGulf Coast Region (1,171 mbpcd)\nGalveston Bay, Texas City, Texas Refinery (593 mbpcd)\nOur Galveston Bay refinery is a world-class refining complex resulting from the combination of our former Texas City refinery and Galveston Bay refinery. The refinery is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 30 miles southeast of Houston, Texas and can process a wide variety of crude oils into gasoline, distillates, feedstocks, petrochemicals, propane and heavy fuel oil. The refinery has access to the export market and multiple options to sell refined products. Our cogeneration facility, which supplies the Galveston Bay refinery, currently has 1,055 megawatts of electrical production capacity and can produce 4.3 million pounds of steam per hour. Approximately 49 percent of the power generated in 2020 was used at the refinery, with the remaining electricity being sold into the electricity grid.\nGaryville, Louisiana Refinery (578 mbpcd)\nOur Garyville refinery, which is one of the largest refineries in the U.S., is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans, Louisiana and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

The Salt Lake City refinery processes crude oil from Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Canada to manufacture gasoline, distillates, propane, heavy fuel oil, feedstocks and petrochemicals.\nWest Coast Region (550 mbpcd)\nLos Angeles, California Refinery (363 mbpcd)\nOur Los Angeles refinery is located in Los Angeles County, near the Los Angeles Harbor. The Los Angeles refinery is the largest refinery on the West Coast and is a major producer of clean fuels. The Los Angeles refinery processes heavy crude from California’s San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles Basin as well as crudes from the Alaska North Slope, South America, West Africa and other international sources and manufactures cleaner-burning CARB gasoline and CARB diesel fuel, as well as conventional gasoline, distillates, feedstocks, petrochemicals, heavy fuel oil and propane.\nAnacortes, Washington Refinery (119 mbpcd)\nOur Anacortes refinery is located about 70 miles north of Seattle on Puget Sound. The Anacortes refinery processes Canadian crude, domestic crude from North Dakota and Alaska North Slope and international crudes to manufacture gasoline, distillates, heavy fuel oil, feedstocks, propane and petrochemicals.\nKenai, Alaska Refinery (68 mbpcd)\nOur Kenai refinery is located on the Cook Inlet, 60 miles southwest of Anchorage. The Kenai refinery processes mainly Alaska domestic crude, domestic crude from North Dakota, along with limited international crude and manufactures distillates, gasoline, heavy fuel oil, feedstocks, asphalt, propane and petrochemicals.\nPlanned maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional detail.\nRefined Product Yields\nThe following table sets forth our refinery production by product group for each of the last three years including production from the refineries acquired in the Andeavor acquisition from October 1, 2018 forward.\n7\nCrude Oil Supply\nWe obtain the crude oil we refine through negotiated term contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. Our term contracts generally have market-related pricing provisions. The following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for each of the last three years. It includes crude sourced for the refineries acquired in the Andeavor acquisition from October 1, 2018 forward. The crude oil sourced outside of North America was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, production companies and trading companies.\nOur refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks and distribute our refined products through a variety of channels, including pipelines, trucks, railcars, ships and barges.\nRenewable Fuels\nDuring 2020, we completed the conversion of our Dickinson, North Dakota refinery into an approximately 184 million gallons per year renewable diesel facility.\nWe also progressed activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers, and beginning detailed engineering activities. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. On February 24, 2021, MPC’s board of directors approved these plans.\nWe own a biofuel production facility in Cincinnati, Ohio that produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately 91 million gallons per year.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Virent, is an advanced biofuels facility in Madison, Wisconsin that is working to commercialize a process for converting biobased feedstocks into renewable fuels and chemicals.\nWe hold an ownership interest in ethanol production facilities in Albion, Michigan; Logansport, Indiana; Greenville, Ohio and Denison, Iowa. These plants have a combined ethanol production capacity of approximately 475 million gallons per year and are managed by our joint venture partner, The Andersons.\nRefined Product Marketing\nOur refined products are sold to independent retailers, wholesale customers, our brand jobbers and direct dealers. In addition, we sell refined products for export to international customers. As of December 31, 2020, there were 7,090 branded outlets in 35 states, the District of Columbia and Mexico where independent entrepreneurs primarily maintain Marathon-branded outlets. We also have long-term supply contracts for 1,093 direct dealer locations primarily in Southern California, largely under the ARCO\n®\nbrand. We believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers and consumers within our 41-state market area.\n8\nThe following table sets forth our refined product sales volumes by product group for each of the last three years including sales from the refineries acquired in the Andeavor acquisition from October 1, 2018 forward.\nRefined Product Sales Destined for Export\nWe sell gasoline, distillates and asphalt for export, primarily out of our Garyville, Galveston Bay, Anacortes, Los Angeles and Kenai refineries. The following table sets forth our refined product sales destined for export by product group for the past three years including sales from the refineries acquired in the Andeavor acquisition from October 1, 2018 forward.\nGasoline and Distillates\nWe sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and distillates (including No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, jet fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel) to wholesale customers, Marathon-branded jobbers, direct dealers and in the spot market. In addition, we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers. The demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months.\nFeedstocks and Petrochemicals\nWe are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and petrochemicals. Product availability varies by refinery and includes, among others, propylene, naphtha, butane, xylene, benzene, alkylate, cumene, raffinate, toluene and platformate. We market these products domestically to customers in the chemical, agricultural and fuel-blending industries. In addition, we produce fuel-grade coke at our Garyville, Detroit, Galveston Bay and Los Angeles refineries, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications, and anode-grade coke at our Los Angeles and Robinson refineries, in addition to calcined coke at our Los Angeles refinery, which are both used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry.\nAsphalt\nWe have refinery-based asphalt production capacity of up to 139 mbpcd, which includes asphalt cements, polymer-modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt, industrial asphalts and roofing flux. We have a broad customer base, including asphalt-paving contractors, resellers, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail, barge and vessel.\nPropane\nWe produce propane at all of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are split approximately 80 percent and 20 percent between the home heating market and petrochemical consumers, respectively.\n9\nHeavy Fuel Oil\nWe produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components, including slurry, at all of our refineries. Heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product.\nTerminals and Transportation\nWe transport, store and distribute crude oil, feedstocks and refined products through pipelines, terminals and marine fleets owned by MPLX and third parties in our market areas.\nWe own a fleet of transport trucks and trailers for the movement of refined products and crude oil. In addition, we maintain a fleet of leased and owned railcars for the movement and storage of refined products.\nThe locations and detailed information about our Refining & Marketing assets are included under Item 2. Properties and are incorporated herein by reference.\nCompetition, Market Conditions and Seasonality\nThe downstream petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products. We compete with a number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of refined products. Based upon company data as reported in the “The Oil & Gas Journal 2020 Worldwide Refinery Survey,” we ranked first among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity.\nWe compete in\nfour dis\ntinct markets for the sale of refined products—wholesale, including exports, spot, branded and\nretail\ndistribution. Our marketing operations compete with numerous other independent marketers, integrated oil companies and high-volume retailers. We compete with companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; and refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner-branded independent entrepreneurs. In addition, we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and retail consumers.\nMarket conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils, ANS, WTI and LLS crude oils and other market structure impacts also affect our operating results.\nDemand for gasoline, diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets, primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction. As a result, the operating results for our Refining & Marketing segment for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year.\nMIDSTREAM\nThe Midstream segment primarily includes the operations of MPLX, our sponsored MLP, and certain related operations retained by MPC.\nMPLX\nMPLX owns and operates a network of crude oil, natural gas and refined product pipelines and has joint ownership interests in other crude oil and refined products pipelines. MPLX also owns and operates light products terminals, storage assets and maintains a fleet of owned and leased towboats and barges. MPLX’s assets also include natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and NGL fractionation complexes.\n10\nMPC-Retained Midstream Assets and Investments\nWe have ownership interests in several crude oil and refined products pipeline systems and pipeline companies and have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures through our investment in Crowley Coastal Partners.\nThe locations and detailed information about our Midstream assets are included under Item 2. Properties and are incorporated herein by reference.\nCompetition, Market Conditions and Seasonality\nOur Midstream operations face competition for natural gas gathering, crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services; in obtaining unprocessed NGLs for gathering, transportation and fractionation; and in marketing our products and services. Competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants, operating efficiency and reliability, residue gas and NGL market connectivity, the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered and the fees charged for the services supplied to the customer. Competition for oil supplies is based primarily on the price and scope of services, location of gathering/transportation and storage facilities and connectivity to the best priced markets. Competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of fractionation capacity, proximity to supply and industry marketing centers, the fees charged for fractionation services and operating efficiency and reliability of service. Competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and NGLs is based primarily on price, credit and market connectivity. In addition, certain of our Midstream operations are subject to rate regulation, which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines.\nOur Midstream segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and NGLs and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations include, among others, the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized.\nFor a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs. For additional information regarding regulatory risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAir\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nWe believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, and climate adaptation will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities, (iii) capture the emissions from our facilities and (iv) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\nIn January 2021, President Biden announced that the United States was rejoining the 2015 Paris UN Climate Change Conference Agreement, effective February 19, 2021. President Biden also issued an Executive Order on climate change in which he announced putting the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. The Executive Order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands, reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible, and requires federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions\n11\nand climate change. In a second Executive Order, President Biden reestablished a working group to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane. The social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. A higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation.\nStates are becoming active in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. These measures may include state actions to develop statewide or regional programs to impose emission reductions. These measures may also include low-carbon fuel standards, such as the California program, or a state carbon tax. These measures could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls and costs to administer any carbon trading or tax programs implemented. For example, the California state legislature enacted AB 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 percent reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in SB 32. Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. Much of the compliance costs associated with these California regulations are ultimately passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fuel costs. States are increasingly announcing aspirational goals to be net-zero carbon emissions by a certain date through both legislation and executive orders. To date, these states have not provided significant details as to achievement of these goals; however, meeting these aspirations will require a reduction in fossil fuel combustion and/or a mechanism to capture greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. As a result, we cannot currently predict the impact of these potential regulations on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.\nOther Air Emissions\nIn 2015, United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) finalized a revision to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone. The EPA lowered the primary ozone NAAQS from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. In December 2020, the EPA published a rule maintaining this standard. Designation as a nonattainment area could result in increased costs associated with, or result in cancellation or delay of, capital projects at our facilities, or could require nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) and/or volatile organic compound (“VOC”) reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities.\nIn California, the Board for the South Coast Air Quality Management District (“SCAQMD”) passed amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (“RECLAIM”) that became effective in 2016, requiring a staged reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022. In 2017, the State of California passed AB 617, which requires implementation of best available retrofit control technology (“BARCT”) on specific facilities, including facilities subject to RECLAIM. In response to AB 617, the SCAQMD is currently working to identify BARCT and determine whether to “sunset” the existing RECLAIM program. A “sunset” of the RECLAIM program and application of BARCT is expected to result in increased costs to operate and maintain our Los Angeles refinery.\nWater\nWe maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which, among other things, requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. OPA-90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility.\nOn October 22, 2019, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (“Army Corps”) published a final rule to repeal the 2015 “Clean Water Rule: Definition of Waters of the United States” (“2015 Rule”), which amended portions of the Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”) to restore the regulatory text that existed prior to the 2015 Rule, effective December 23, 2019. The rule repealing the 2015 Clean Water Rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts. On April 21, 2020, the EPA and the Army Corps promulgated the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (“2020 Rule”) to define “waters of the United States.” The 2020 Rule has been challenged in court. The Biden administration has signaled its intent to revisit the definition of “waters of the United States,” and replace it with a definition consistent with the 2015 Rule. A\n12\nbroader definition could result in increased cost of compliance or increased capital costs for construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities.\nIn April 2020, the U.S. District Court in Montana vacated Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP 12”), which authorizes the placement of fill material in “waters of the United States” for utility line activities as long as certain best management practices are implemented. The decision was ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which partially reversed the district court’s decision, temporarily reinstating NWP 12 for all projects except the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The United States Army Corps of Engineers subsequently reissued its nationwide permit authorizations on January 13, 2021, by dividing the NWP that authorizes utility line activities (NWP 12) into three separate NWPs that address the differences in how different utility line projects are constructed, the substances they convey, and the different standards and best management practices that help ensure those NWPs authorize only those activities that have no more than minimal adverse environmental effects. The 2021 authorization may be challenged in court or the Biden Administration may repeal or replace the 2021 authorization in a subsequent rulemaking. Repeal or replacement of the rule could impact pipeline maintenance activities.\nAs part of our emergency response activities, we have used aqueous film forming foam (“AFFF”) containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) chemicals as a fire suppressant. At this time, AFFFs containing PFAS are the only proven foams that can prevent and control most flammable petroleum-based liquid fires.\nIn May 2016, the EPA issued lifetime health advisories (“HAs”) and health effects support documents for two PFAS substances - Perfluorooctanoic Acid (“PFOA”) and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (“PFOS”). Then, in February 2019, EPA issued a PFAS Action Plan identifying actions the EPA is planning to take to study and regulate various PFAS chemicals. The EPA identified that it would evaluate, among other actions, (1) proposing national drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, (2) develop cleanup recommendations for PFOA and PFOS, (3) evaluate listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, and (4) conduct toxicity assessments for other PFAS chemicals. To date EPA has not issued any further regulations for PFAS under the Trump administration; however, the Biden Administration has indicated its intent to issue proposed rules to regulate PFAS, which could include the designation of variants of PFAS as CERCLA hazardous substances and/or establish national drinking water standards. Congress may also take further action to regulate PFAS. We cannot currently predict the impact of potential statutes or regulations on our operations or remediation costs.\nIn addition, many states are actively proposing and adopting legislation and regulations relating to the use of AFFF. Additionally, some states are adopting and proposing state-specific drinking water and cleanup standards for various PFAS. We cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.\nSolid Waste\nWe continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of USTs containing regulated substances.\nRemediation\nWe own or operate, or have owned or operated, certain convenience stores and other locations where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. Penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the applicable state laws and regulations. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery, terminal and pipeline locations.\nClaims under CERCLA and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the clean-up of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the clean-up of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint\n13\nand several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean-up costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA; however, we do not believe such costs will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRenewable Fuels and Other Fuels Requirements\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”), which, among other things, set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020. In March 2020, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) released the final Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (“SAFE”) Vehicles Rule setting corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) and carbon dioxide (“CO2”) standards for model years 2021-2026 passenger cars and light trucks. The final rule increases the stringency of CAFE and CO2 emission standards by 1.5 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026. The rule has been challenged in court and could be revised by the Biden Administration through notice and comment rulemaking. Higher CAFE standards for cars and light trucks have the potential to reduce demand for our transportation fuels.\nIn addition, the NHTSA and the EPA issued rules providing that the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (“EPCA”) preempts state regulations of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions, withdrew the waiver granted to California for its Advanced Clean Car program and determined that the Clean Air Act permits other states to adopt only those California standards that are designed to control traditional “criteria pollutants.” California may establish per its Clean Air Act waiver authority different standards that could apply in multiple states. California’s governor issued an executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Other states have issued, or may issue, zero emission vehicle mandates. The Biden Administration could reinstate the California waiver and may take federal action to incentivize or mandate zero emission vehicle production.\nPursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the EISA, the EPA has promulgated a Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) program that requires certain volumes of renewable fuel be blended with our products. By November 30 of each year, the EPA is required to promulgate the annual renewable fuel standards for the following compliance year. In a legal challenge to the 2014-2016 volumes, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the total renewable volume for 2016 and remanded to the EPA for reconsideration consistent with the court’s opinion. A rule that increases the total renewable volume for any compliance year to make up for the 2016 shortfall could increase our cost of compliance with the RFS program, require us to use carryover RINs and be detrimental to the RIN market.\nThe EPA has finalized the annual renewable fuel standards for the year 2020. For the first time, the EPA has proposed to reallocate to non-exempt obligated parties the renewable volume obligations of the refiners that were granted a small refinery exemption. Also, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a small refinery is eligible for an exemption from the RFS only if it is applying for an extension of its original exemption. According to the EPA’s data, seven refineries were granted the small refinery exemption in 2015. The United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in the 10th Circuit case. If the 10th Circuit decision is upheld, EPA’s reallocation of volumes could be greater than the actual volumes exempted in 2020. The reallocation of volumes under the 2020 rule or the invalidation of past small refinery exemptions granted to us or other refiners could result in a decrease in the RIN bank, an increase in the price of RINs or an increase in the amount of renewable fuel we are required to blend, any of which could increase MPC’s RFS cost of compliance. Further, the EPA has failed to promulgate timely the annual renewable fuel standards for 2021.\nThe RFS is satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (“E10”). Since 2016, the volume requirements have resulted in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or ethanol flex fuel at levels that exceed historical levels or retire carryover RINs.\nThere is currently no regulatory method for verifying the validity of the RINs sold on the open market. We have developed a RIN integrity program to vet the RINs that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit RIN generators. Nevertheless, if any of the RINs that we purchase and use for compliance are found to be invalid, we could incur costs and penalties for replacing the invalid RINs.\n14\nIn addition to the federal Renewable Fuel Standards, certain states have, or are considering, promulgation of state renewable or low carbon fuel standards. For example, California began implementing its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) in January 2011. In September 2015, the CARB approved the re-adoption of the LCFS, which became effective on January 1, 2016, to address procedural deficiencies in the way the original regulation was adopted. The LCFS was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20 percent reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. We incur costs to comply with the California LCFS, and these costs may increase if the cost of LCFS credits increases.\nIn sum, the RFS has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined products being replaced by renewable fuels. Demand for our refined products also may decrease as a result of low carbon fuel standard programs or electric vehicle mandates.\nSafety Matters\nWe are subject to oversight pursuant to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), as well as comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. We believe that we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record-keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.\nWe are also subject at regulated facilities to the OSHA’s Process Safety Management (“PSM”) and EPA’s Risk Management Program requirements, which are intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The application of these regulations can result in increased compliance expenditures.\nIn general, we expect industry and regulatory safety standards to become stricter over time, resulting in increased compliance expenditures. While these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline assets. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans.\nTribal Lands\nVarious federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of the Interior, along with certain Native American tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American tribal lands where we operate. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct, our operations on such lands.\nTRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSES\nOur Marathon and ARCO trademarks are material to the conduct of our refining and marketing operations, and our Speedway trademark is material to the conduct of our retail operations. We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe believe our employees are our greatest source of strength, and our culture reflects the quality of individuals across our workforce. Our collaborative efforts to foster an inclusive environment, provide\n15\nbroad-based development and mentorship opportunities, recognize and reward accomplishments, and offer benefits that support the well-being of our employees and their families contribute to increased engagement and fulfilling careers. Empowering our people and prioritizing accountability also are key components for developing MPC’s high-performing culture, which is critical to achieving our strategic vision.\nEmployee Profile\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 57,900 people in full-time and part-time roles. Excluding employees of Speedway, which is targeted to be sold in the first quarter of 2021, we employ approximately 18,600 people in full-time and part-time roles. Many of these employees provide services to MPLX, for which we are reimbursed in accordance with employee service agreements. Approximately 3,770 of the 18,600 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nTalent Management\nExecuting our strategic vision requires that we attract and retain the best talent. Recruiting and retention success requires that we effectively nurture new employees, providing opportunities for long-term engagement and career advancement. We also appropriately reward high-performers and offer competitive benefits. Our Talent Acquisition team consists of three segments: Executive Recruiting, Experienced Recruiting and University Recruiting. The specialization within each group allows us to specifically address MPC’s broad range of current and future talent needs, as well as devote time and attention to candidates during the hiring process. We value diverse perspectives in the workforce, and accordingly we seek candidates with a variety of backgrounds and experience. Our primary source of full-time, entry-level new hires is our intern/co-op program. Through our university recruiters, we offer college students who have completed their freshman year the opportunity to participate in our hands-on programs focused in areas of finance and accounting, marketing, engineering and IT.\nWe provide a broad range of leadership training opportunities to support the development of leaders at all levels. Our programs, which are offered across the organization are a blended approach of business and leadership content, with many featuring external faculty. We utilize various learning modalities, such as visual, audio, print, tactile, interactive, kinesthetic, experiential and leader-teaching-leader to address and engage different learning styles. We believe networking and access to our executive team are a key leadership success factor, and we incorporate these opportunities into all of our programs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nTo ensure we are offering competitive pay packages in our recruitment and retention efforts, we annually benchmark compensation, including base salaries, bonus levels and equity targets. Our annual bonus program is a critical component of our compensation, as it provides individual reward for MPC’s achievement against preset financial and sustainability goals, encouraging a sense of employee ownership. Employees in our officer-level pay grades, as well as senior leaders and most mid-level leaders, are eligible to receive long-term equity incentive awards as part of their compensation.\nWe offer comprehensive benefits, including medical, dental and vision insurance for our employees, their spouses or domestic partners, and their dependents. We also provide retirement programs, life insurance, education assistance, family assistance, short-term disability and paid vacation and sick time. Following our acquisition of Andeavor, we enhanced several of our benefits programs to reflect our larger, coast-to-coast organization. We increased the maximum accrual cap for vacation banks and doubled the number of college and trade school scholarships offered to the high school senior children of our employees through the Marathon Petroleum Scholars Program. In addition, we increased our paid parental leave benefit to eight weeks for birth mothers and four weeks for nonbirth parents, including adoptive and foster parents. Both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for this benefit. Parents who both work for the company are each eligible for a parental pay benefit.\nInclusion\nOur company-wide Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) program is managed by a dedicated D&I Office team and supported by leadership. Our program is based on our three-pillar D&I strategy, of building awareness, increasing representation and ensuring success. The strategy focuses on understanding the benefits of diverse perspectives, increasing diversity across the organization and recognizing that cultural inclusion is an ongoing process. We have employee networks focusing on six populations: Asian, Black, Hispanic, Veterans, Women and LGBTQ+. Our employee networks have approximately 60 chapters across the company and all networks encourage ally membership. This broad support extends also to our leaders throughout MPC, with each employee network represented by two active executive sponsors. The sponsors\n16\nform several counsels that meet regularly to share updates, gain alignment, build deeper connections across networks and pursue collaboration ideas. Our employee networks not only provide opportunities for our employees to make meaningful and supportive connections, but they also serve a significant role in our D&I strategy.\nSafety\nWe are committed to safe operations to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities. Our commitment to safe operations is reflected in our safety systems design, our well-maintained equipment and by learning from our incidents. Part of our effort to promote safety includes a management system based on the principles of RC14001®, the Plan-Do-Check-Act continual improvement cycle, and our Operational Excellence Management System. Together, these components of our safety management system provide us with a comprehensive approach to managing risks and preventing incidents, illnesses and fatalities. Additionally, our annual cash bonus program metrics includes several employee, process and environmental safety metrics.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In March 2020, MPC activated its Corporate Emergency Response Team to ensure a consistent and aggressive response across all facets of our company. The safety and health of our employees, including our essential personnel, were our top priorities. As part of our existing pandemic plan, we had a central inventory of N95 respirators, surgical masks, and nitrile gloves to supply to our employees and contractors when the pandemic began. We implemented a number of protective measures to ensure employee and contractor safety as they continued to keep our critical operations running safely. We continue to monitor the situation and adapt our practices as appropriate.\nInformation about our Executive and Corporate Officers\nThe executive and corporate officers of MPC are as follows:\n* Corporate officer.\n17\nMr. Hennigan\nwas appointed President and Chief Executive Officer effective March 2020, and as a member of the Board of Directors effective April 2020.

    "text": "You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture, sell, transport and store, which has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our business and on general economic, financial and business conditions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact worldwide economic and commercial activity. Travel restrictions, business and school closures, increased remote work, stay-at-home orders and other actions taken by individuals, governments and the private sector to stem the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity, significantly reduced demand for the petroleum products that we manufacture, sell, transport and store, and contributed to increased market and oil price volatility. Our refinery utilization and operating margins and other aspects of our business have been adversely impacted by these developments.\nDuring 2020, there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories. In each quarter of 2020, these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market.\nDepending on future movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect on our financial performance. In addition, a sustained period of low crude oil prices may also result in significant financial constraints on certain producers from which we acquire our crude oil, which could result in long term crude oil supply constraints for our business. Such conditions could also result in an increased risk that our customers and other counterparties may be unable to fully fulfill their obligations in a timely manner, or at all.\nResurgences in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new stay-at-home orders or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, which could further weaken demand for the petroleum products we manufacture, sell, transport and store, and could contribute to increased market and oil price volatility.\nA prolonged period of economic slowdown or recession, or a protracted period of depressed prices for crude oil or refined petroleum products, could continue to have significant and adverse consequences for our financial condition and the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and\n20\ncould diminish our liquidity, trigger additional impairments and negatively affect our ability to obtain adequate crude oil volumes and to market certain of our products at favorable prices, or at all.\nThe ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect us and our customers, suppliers and other counterparties will depend largely on the length and severity of the pandemic; actions taken by individuals, governments and the private sector to stem the spread of the virus; general economic conditions; and the availability and widespread distribution and use of safe and effective vaccines, all of which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nOur financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent on factors beyond our control.\nOur operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products. Historically, refining and marketing margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. Our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. The price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control, including:\n•\nworldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil and refined products;\n•\ntransportation infrastructure availability, local market conditions and operation levels of other refineries in our markets;\n•\nnatural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;\n•\npolitical instability, threatened or actual terrorist incidents, armed conflict or other global political conditions;\n•\nlocal weather conditions;\n•\nseasonality of demand in our marketing areas due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months;\n•\nnatural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes;\n•\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and\n•\nlocal, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions.\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. We purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks can have a significant effect on our financial results. We also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers. Price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products can have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLower refining and marketing margins have in the past, and may in the future, lead us to reduce the amount of refined products we produce, which may reduce our revenues, income from operations and cash flows. Significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets (such as property, plant and equipment, inventory or goodwill), and require us to re-evaluate practices regarding our repurchase activity and dividends.\nLegal, technological, political and scientific developments regarding emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels.\nDevelopments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing vehicle efficiency may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels. In March 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) released the final Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (“SAFE”) Vehicles Rule setting corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) and carbon dioxide (“CO2”) standards for model years 2021 through 2026 passenger cars and light trucks. The final rule increases the stringency of CAFE and CO2 emission standards by 1.5 percent each year from model years 2021 through 2026. The rule has been challenged in court and could be revised by the Biden Administration through notice and comment rulemaking. In addition, California’s governor issued an executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Other states have, or may issue, zero-emission\n21\nvehicle mandates. Future developments involving climate change and environmental laws and regulations may require heightened fuel efficiency standards.\nGovernment efforts to steer the public toward non-petroleum-based fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs for our products. New technologies that increase fuel efficiency or offer alternative vehicle power sources and the proliferation of alternative-fuel vehicles (i.e., vehicles that do not use petroleum-based transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines) may result in decreased demand for petroleum-based transportation fuel. These developments could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, which could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions, such as scheduled and unscheduled refinery turnarounds, unplanned maintenance, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, power outages, severe weather, labor disputes, acts of terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. The inability to operate one or more of our facilities due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture our products.\nExplosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, product quality or other incidents may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. We have experienced certain of these incidents in the past. For assets located near populated areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater.\nIn addition, we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker, pipeline, rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. Certain of our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker or barge. MPLX operates a fleet of boats and barges to transport light products, heavy oils, crude oil, renewable fuels, chemicals and feedstocks to and from refineries and terminals owned by MPC. Transportation and storage of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the OPA-90 and state laws in U.S. coastal and Great Lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate, as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. If we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers, pipelines, rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil, other feedstocks or refined products, we may be subject to substantial liability. In addition, the service providers contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions, governmental regulations or other local or global events.\nDamages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.\nWe rely on the performance of our information technology systems, and the interruption or failure of any information technology system, including an interruption or failure due to a cybersecurity breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information technology systems (and those of our third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted on proprietary servers), including our network infrastructure and cloud applications, for the safe and effective operation of our business. We rely on such systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee, customer, investor and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, retail sales, credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions. Our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. We also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers and employee malfeasance, including threats to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems or render data or systems unusable.\n22\nOur cybersecurity protections, infrastructure protection technologies, disaster recovery plans and employee training may not be sufficient to defend us against all unauthorized attempts to access our information. We have been and may in the future be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to our computer network and systems. To date, the impacts of prior events have not had a material adverse effect on us.\nAny cybersecurity incident involving our information technology systems or those of our third-party business partners could result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential financial and other data, intellectual property, customer awards or loyalty points; give rise to remediation or other expenses; expose us to liability under federal and state laws; reduce our customers’ willingness to do business with us; disrupt the services we provide to customers; and subject us to litigation and legal liability under federal and state laws. Any of such results could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business.\nWe compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies, including certain multinational oil companies. Competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry. For example, competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nWe have agreed to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven. Nevertheless, pending closing of the Speedway sale, which remains subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals, we still face strong competition in the market for the retail sale of transportation fuels and merchandise. Our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling transportation fuels and merchandise at very competitive prices. Non-traditional transportation fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market. These retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales, which could in turn pressure us to offer similar discounts. Additionally, the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either transportation fuels or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to interruptions of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nWe utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. In addition to our own operational risks, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions.\nIn particular, pipelines or railroads provide a nearly exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to, or refined products from, some of our refineries. A prolonged interruption, material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway, whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason, or any other prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks, pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant decrease in oil and natural gas production in MPLX’s areas of operation may adversely affect MPLX’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including MPC.\nA significant portion of MPLX’s operations is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production. The production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers will naturally decline over time, which means that MPLX’s cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of MPLX’s facilities, MPLX must continually obtain new oil, natural gas, NGL and refined product supplies, which depend in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its system capacity as needed.\n23\nWe have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of MPLX’s operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. In addition, we have no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by demand, prevailing and projected energy prices, drilling costs, operational challenges, access to downstream markets, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital. Reductions in exploration or production activity in MPLX’s areas of operations could lead to reduced throughput on its pipelines and utilization rates of its facilities.\nDecreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. The prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations. Sustained periods of low prices could result in producers deciding to limit their oil and gas drilling operations, which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs to MPLX’s facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us.\nThis impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of MPLX’s commodity-based contracts, which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and NGL prices than its fee-based contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a Btu equivalent basis than NGL products. In addition, the purchase and resale of natural gas and NGLs in the ordinary course exposes our Midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or NGL prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction, and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes. Also, the significant volatility in natural gas, NGL and oil prices could adversely impact MPLX’s unit price, thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital. Such impacts could adversely impact MPLX’s ability to execute its long‑term organic growth projects, satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels, and may also result in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill or other-than-temporary non-cash impairments of our equity method investments.\nSevere weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations.\nOur facilities are subject to potential acute physical risks, such as floods, hurricane-force winds, wildfires and snowstorms, and potential chronic physical risks, such as sea-level rise or water shortages. If any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks. To the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity, we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks arising from our operations outside the United States and generally to worldwide political and economic developments.\nWe operate and sell some of our products outside the United States, particularly in Mexico, South America and Asia. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets, including economic instability, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties and tariffs, transportation delays, difficulty in enforcing contractual provisions, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments. Global outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could affect demand for refined products and economic conditions generally. In addition, if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries, if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated, if new economic sanctions relevant to such jurisdictions are passed or if taxes, border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Our compliance policies and programs mandate\n24\ncompliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. Our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. Actual or alleged violations of these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMore broadly, political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. Hostilities in the Middle East or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the U.S. and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products, NGLs and natural gas. Additionally, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. Additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. For example, the U.S. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products, NGLs, natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries. In addition, foreign countries could restrict imports, investments or commercial transactions.\nOur investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our reliance on our joint venture partners and their financial condition, and our joint venture partners may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners. Our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have an interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.\nRefining, gathering and processing, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, and other energy assets, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. Any terrorist attack on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other energy assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have significant debt obligations; therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile or downgrade of our credit ratings, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally.\nAt December 31, 2020, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and finance lease obligations were $32.17 billion, including $20.54 billion of obligations of MPLX and its subsidiaries and $130 million of obligations of Speedway. We may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future.\nOur indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could have material adverse consequences, including:\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;\n•\nlimiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n•\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.\n25\nA decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit. Our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. The planned Speedway sale could be a factor causing or contributing to a future determination by one or more of the rating agencies to lower our credit rating. Any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to $750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables outstanding. In periods of lower prices, we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility.\nOur working capital, cash flows and liquidity can be significantly affected by decreases in commodity prices.\nPayment terms for our crude oil purchases are generally longer than the terms we extend to our customers for refined product sales. As a result, the payables for our crude oil purchases are proportionally larger than the receivables for our refined product sales. Due to this net payables position, a decrease in commodity prices generally results in a use of working capital, and given the significant volume of crude oil that we purchase the impact can materially affect our working capital, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe expected phase out of LIBOR could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and could cause our interest expense to increase.\nA portion of our borrowing capacity and outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. The ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“ICE”) announced that it will cease calculating and publishing all USD LIBOR tenors on June 30, 2023 and cease calculating and publishing certain USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021. Further, U.K. and U.S. regulatory authorities have recently issued statements encouraging banks to cease entering into new USD LIBOR based loans as soon as possible and by no later than December 31, 2021 and to continue to transition away from USD LIBOR based loans in preparation of ICE ceasing to calculate and public LIBOR based rates on June 30, 2023. These developments may cause fluctuations in LIBOR rates and pricing of USD LIBOR based loans that are not transitioned to a new benchmark rate.\nThe agreements that govern our variable rate indebtedness contain customary transition and fallback provisions in contemplation of the cessation of LIBOR. Nevertheless, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks or floating rate indebtedness. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks. Furthermore, the use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our floating rate indebtedness to be materially different than expected and could materially adversely impact our ability to refinance such floating rate indebtedness or raise future indebtedness on a cost effective basis.\nWe may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.\nWe currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. Derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. The risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.\nWe do not insure against all potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.\nWe maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. Uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our\n26\nassets or operations, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Historically, we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. In the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become further impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nWe accounted for the Andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our balance sheet reflected $8.3 billion and $2.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively. In 2020, we recorded approximately $7.4 billion and $177 million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment expense, respectively. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes further impaired, we may be required to incur additional material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.\nLarge capital projects can take years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns.\nWe have several large capital projects underway, including the activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Delays in completing capital projects or making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n•\ndenials of, delays in receiving, or revocations of requisite regulatory approvals or permits;\n•\nunplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n•\ndisruptions in transportation of components or construction materials;\n•\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;\n•\nshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n•\nmarket-related increases in a project’s debt or equity financing costs;\n•\nnonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors; and\n•\ndelays due to citizen, state or local political or activist pressure.\nAny one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs to meet the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations. Future environmental laws and regulations may impact our current business plans and reduce demand for our products.\nOur business is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our business. Laws and regulations expected to become more stringent relate to the following:\n•\nthe emission or discharge of materials into the environment,\n•\nsolid and hazardous waste management,\n•\nthe regulatory classification of materials currently or formerly used in our business,\n•\npollution prevention,\n•\ngreenhouse gas emissions,\n•\nclimate change,\n27\n•\ncharacteristics and composition of transportation fuels, including the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into transportation fuels,\n•\npublic and employee safety and health,\n•\npermitting,\n•\ninherently safer technology, and\n•\nfacility security.\nThe specific impact of laws and regulations, and their enforcement, on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources, production processes and subsequent judicial interpretation of such laws and regulations. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean-up costs due to alleged contamination and/or exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, or other per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, benzene, MTBE and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. Such expenditures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities could result in reductions or delays in U.S. production of crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, we do provide gathering, processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations. Our refineries are also supplied in part with crude oil produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs. A range of federal, state and local laws and regulations currently govern or, in some cases, prohibit, hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions. Stricter laws, regulations and permitting processes may be enacted in the future. For example, President Biden has suspended new oil and gas permitting on public lands and properties, and has proposed modifying royalties to account for climate costs. If these or other federal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing or other oil and gas production activities are enacted or expanded, such efforts could impede oil and gas production, increase producers’ cost of compliance, and result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather, process and fractionate.\nClimate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations, energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations, any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) and other emissions are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. These include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for refined products. Requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.\nFor example, in 2017, the California state legislature adopted AB 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40 percent reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in SB 32. Compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. Additionally, the CARB is now exploring the potential for additional greenhouse gas reductions by 2045 via a yet undefined carbon neutrality standard. Other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRegional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy. Increasing concerns about climate change and carbon\n28\nintensity have also resulted in societal concerns and a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Additional stricter measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\nInternational climate change-related efforts, such as the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations. Though the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden issued an executive order recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2021. President Biden also issued an Executive Order on climate change in which he announced putting the U.S. on a path to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. The Executive Order also calls for the federal government to pause oil and gas leasing on federal lands, reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as quickly as possible, and requires federal permitting decisions to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. In a second Executive Order, President Biden reestablished a working group to develop the social cost of carbon and the social cost of methane. The social cost of carbon and social cost of methane can be used to weigh the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. A higher social cost of carbon could support more stringent greenhouse gas emission regulation.\nThe scope and magnitude of the changes to U.S. climate change strategy under the Biden administration and future administrations, however, remain subject to the passage of legislation and interpretation and action of federal and state regulatory bodies; therefore, the impact to our industry and operations due to greenhouse gas regulation is unknown at this time.\nEnergy assets and companies are subject to increasing environmental and climate-related litigation.\nGovernmental and other entities in various U.S. states have filed lawsuits against coal, gas, oil and petroleum companies, including us. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. Additionally, private plaintiffs and government parties have undertaken efforts to shut down energy assets by challenging operating permits, the validity of easements or the compliance with easement conditions. For example, the Dakota Access Pipeline, in which MPLX has a minority interest, has been subject to litigation in which plaintiffs have challenged the validity of an easement necessary for the operation of the pipeline and demanded a permanent shutdown of the pipeline. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these types of proceedings, as well as their potential effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. Such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies.\nWe operate and develop our business with the expectation that regulations and societal sentiment will continue to enable the development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. However, policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation, storage and marketing of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups.\nThe approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines, negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations. In addition, government disruptions may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. Our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule (or at all), or at the budgeted cost. We also may be required to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the design and installation of our facilities due to their location and the surrounding terrain. We may be required to install additional facilities, incur additional capital and operating expenditures, or experience interruptions in or impairments of our operations to the extent that the facilities are not designed or installed correctly.\nMoreover, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project, if at all. Delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely\n29\naffect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results, thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows.\nRegulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail.\nWe rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil, including rail. Rail transportation is regulated by federal, state and local authorities. New regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures. For example, in 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crude-by-rail transportation (Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operational Controls for High-Hazard Flammable Trains). These or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering North American crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries, increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nHistoric or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate.\nWe currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. Our operations, including those of MPLX, and those of our predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. While an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in class-action litigation, large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages. Attorneys general and other government officials have in the past and may in the future pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims, including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages. We are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. If we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to substantial liability, plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 3,771 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of these employees, approximately 192 employees at our St. Paul Park refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. Approximately 231 employees at our El Paso refinery are covered by a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in April 2021. Approximately 2,390 employees at our Anacortes, Canton, Catlettsburg, Galveston Bay, Los Angeles, Mandan, Martinez and Salt Lake City refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire on February 1, 2022. The remaining 958 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. These agreements may be renewed at an increased cost to us. In addition, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements. For example, approximately 192 workers at our St. Paul Park refinery have been on strike since January 21, 2021. Any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, California requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners’ ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants. Legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages, higher labor costs, and an increased risk that contract workers become joint employees, which could trigger bargaining issues, and wage and benefit consequences, especially during critical maintenance and construction periods.\n30\nOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a master limited partnership, which may expose us to certain legal liabilities.\nOne of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of MPLX, a master limited partnership. Our control of the general partner of MPLX may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest. Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf foreign investment in us or MPLX exceeds certain levels, MPLX could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels, which could adversely affect MPLX’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including MPC.\nThe Shipping Act of 1916 and Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (collectively, the “Maritime Laws”), generally require that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be owned by U.S. citizens. Among other requirements to establish citizenship, entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by U.S. citizens. If we fail to maintain compliance with the Maritime Laws, MPLX would be prohibited from operating vessels in the U.S. inland waters. Such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations could be disrupted if we are unable to maintain or obtain real property rights required for our business.\nWe do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located, particularly our midstream assets, but rather obtain the rights to construct and operate such assets on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Therefore, we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases, rights-of-way or other property rights lapse, terminate or are reduced or it is determined that we do not have valid leases, rights-of-way or other property rights. Any loss of or reduction in these rights, including loss or reduction due to legal, governmental or other actions or difficulty renewing leases, right-of-way agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our facilities are located on Native American tribal lands and are subject to various federal and tribal approvals and regulations, which may increase our costs and delay or prevent our efforts to conduct planned operations.\nVarious federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, along with each Native American tribe, regulate natural gas and oil operations on Native American tribal lands, including drilling and production requirements and environmental standards. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees, requirements to employ Native American tribal members and other conditions that apply to operators and contractors conducting operations on Native American tribal lands. Persons conducting operations on tribal lands are generally subject to the Native American tribal court system. In addition, if our relationships with any of the relevant Native American tribes were to deteriorate, we could face significant risks to our ability to continue operations on Native American tribal lands. One or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct operations on such lands.\nThe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders.\nOur Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n•\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of MPC;\n•\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of MPC to MPC or its stockholders\n•\nany action asserting a claim against MPC arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, MPC’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, any Preferred Stock Designation or the Bylaws of MPC; or\n•\nany other action asserting a claim against MPC or any Director or officer of MPC that is governed by or subject to the internal affairs doctrine for choice of law purposes.\n31\nThe forum selection provision may restrict a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim against us or directors or officers of MPC in a forum that it finds favorable, which may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims at all. Alternatively, if a court were to find the forum selection provision contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in another forum, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, the forum selection provision does not apply to any claims, actions or proceedings arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nProvisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity.\nThe existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n•\nproviding that our board of directors fixes the number of members of the board;\n•\nproviding for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;\n•\nproviding that only our board of directors may fill board vacancies;\n•\nlimiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n•\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n•\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n•\nestablishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation;\n•\nproviding that our directors may only be removed for cause;\n•\nauthorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and\n•\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFinally, to facilitate compliance with the Maritime Laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-U.S. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. We may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non-U.S. citizens to exceed 23 percent. Our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. These limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-U.S. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-U.S. citizens. Any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\n32\nStrategic Transaction Risks\nOur pending sale of Speedway to 7-Eleven is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Speedway sale could have a material and adverse effect on us. Even if completed, the Speedway sale may not achieve the intended benefits.\nWe have announced our agreement to sell Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven. The sale, which is targeted for completion in the first quarter of 2021, is subject to customary conditions. We and 7-Eleven may be unable to satisfy such conditions to the closing of the sale in a timely manner or at all and, accordingly, the Speedway sale may be delayed or may not be completed. Failure to complete the Speedway sale could have a material and adverse effect on us, including by delaying our strategic and other objectives relating to the separation of Speedway and adversely affecting our plans to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. Even if the sale is completed, we may not realize some or all the expected benefits. For example, we may be unable to utilize the proceeds from the sale as anticipated or capture the value we expect from our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and return capital to our shareholders. Executing the Speedway sale will require significant time and attention from management, which could divert attention from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. If the proposed Speedway sale is completed, our diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and it is possible that our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be subject to increased volatility as a result.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nSignificant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company, which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. As a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and may present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks, which may include, among others:\n•\ninaccurate assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;\n•\nan inability to successfully integrate, or a delay in the successful integration of, assets or businesses we acquire;\n•\na decrease in our liquidity resulting from using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;\n•\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;\n•\nthe assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n•\nthe diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;\n•\nthe loss of customers or key employees from the acquired business; and\n•\nthe incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.\n33\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties."

    "text": "We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nLitigation\nClimate Change\nGovernmental and other entities in various states have filed lawsuits against energy companies, including MPC. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. The names of the courts in which the proceedings are pending and the dates instituted are as follows:\nDakota Access Pipeline\nIn connection with MPLX’s 9.19 percent indirect interest in a joint venture (“Dakota Access”) that owns and operates the Dakota Access Pipeline and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline projects, (collectively the “Bakken Pipeline system” or “DAPL”), MPLX has entered into a Contingent Equity Contribution Agreement whereby MPLX LP, along with the other joint venture owners in the Bakken Pipeline system, has agreed to make equity contributions to the joint venture upon certain events occurring to allow the entities that own and operate the Bakken Pipeline system to satisfy their senior note payment obligations. The senior notes were issued to repay amounts owed by the pipeline companies to fund the cost of construction of the Bakken Pipeline system.\n44\nIn March 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the “D.D.C.”) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Army Corps”), which granted permits and an easement for the Bakken Pipeline system, to conduct a full environmental impact statement (“EIS”), and further requested briefing on whether an easement necessary for the operation of the Bakken Pipeline system should be vacated while the EIS is being prepared.\nOn July 6, 2020, the D.D.C. ordered vacatur of the easement to cross Lake Oahe during the pendency of an EIS and further ordered a shut down of the pipeline by August 5, 2020. The D.D.C. denied a motion to stay that order. Dakota Access and the Army Corps appealed the D.D.C.’s order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”). On July 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay while the court considered Dakota Access and the Army Corps’ emergency motion for stay pending appeal. On August 5, 2020, the Court of Appeals stayed the D.D.C.’s injunction that required the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil by August 5, 2020. The Court of Appeals denied a stay of the D.D.C.’s March order, which required the EIS, and further denied a stay of the D.D.C.’s July order, which vacated the easement. On January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals upheld the D.D.C.’s order vacating the easement while the Army Corps prepares the EIS. The Court of Appeals reversed the D.D.C.’s order to the extent it directed that the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil. In the D.D.C., briefing has been completed for a renewed request for an injunction. The pipeline remains operational.\nIf the pipeline is temporarily shut down pending completion of the EIS, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of funds required to pay interest accruing on the notes and any portion of the principal that matures while the pipeline is shutdown. It is also expected that MPLX would contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of any costs to remediate any deficiencies to reinstate the permit and/or return the pipeline into operation. If the vacatur of the easement permit results in a permanent shutdown of the pipeline, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of the cost to redeem the bonds (including the one percent redemption premium required pursuant to the indenture governing the notes) and any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under the Contingent Equity Contribution Agreement were approximately $230 million and we had an investment of $465 million in MarEn Bakken Company LLC, which includes our 9.19 percent direct interest in Dakota Access.\nTesoro High Plains Pipeline\nIn early July 2020, MPLX received a Notification of Trespass Determination from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) relating to a portion of the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline that crosses the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. The notification covered the rights of way for 23 tracts of land and demanded the immediate cessation of pipeline operations. The notification also assessed trespass damages of approximately $187 million. MPLX appealed this determination, which triggered an automatic stay of the requested pipeline shutdown and payment. On October 29, the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs issued an order vacating the BIA’s trespass order and requiring the Regional Director for the BIA Great Plains Region to issue a new decision on or before December 15 covering all 34 tracts at issue. On December 15, the Regional Director of the BIA issued a new trespass notice to THPP consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs order vacating the prior trespass order. The new order found that THPP was in trespass and assessed trespass damages of approximately $4MM (including interest). The order also required THPP to immediately cease and desist use of the portion of the pipeline that crosses the property at issue. The new order was appealed, and was upheld by the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs. THPP has complied with the Regional Director’s December 15, 2020 notice. On February 12, 2021, landowners filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota, requesting, among other things, that decisions by the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs and the Interior Board of Indian Appeals be vacated as to the award of damages to plaintiffs.\nMPLX continues to work towards a settlement of this matter with holders of the property rights at issue.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\nItem 103 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions, unless we reasonably believe that the matter will result in no monetary sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of less than $300,000. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement. We do not currently believe that the eventual outcome of any such matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n45\nMartinez Refinery\nWe are currently negotiating the settlement of 141 NOVs received from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (“BAAQMD”). The NOVs were issued from 2011 to 2019 and allege violations of air quality regulations and the idled Martinez refinery’s air permit. While we are negotiating a settlement of the allegations with the BAAQMD through two separate enforcement actions, we cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution of these matters.\nOn July 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) lodged a complaint on behalf of the EPA and a Consent Decree in the U.S. Court for the Western District of Texas. Among other things, the Consent Decree required that the Martinez refinery meet certain annual emission limits for NOx by July 1, 2018. In February 2018, TRMC informed the EPA that it would need additional time to satisfy requirements of the Consent Decree. In the fourth quarter of 2019, TRMC and the United States entered into an agreement to amend the Consent Decree to resolve these issues. In light of the actions to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, we are renegotiating the Consent Decree modification. Subject to final approval by the court, we expect that the renegotiated Consent Decree modification will no longer require the installation of a Selective Catalytic Reduction system to control NOx emissions from the now-idled fluid catalytic cracking unit, but will result in an increased civil penalty.\nGathering and Processing\nIn November 2020, we received an offer from the EPA to settle multiple alleged violations of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants by the Chapita, Coyote Wash, Island, River Bend and Wonsits Valley Compressor Stations in Utah. The proposed settlement consists of an injunctive relief package, mitigation project and proposed penalty in excess of $300,000. We continue to negotiate a settlement of the allegations and cannot currently estimate the timing of the resolution of this matter."

See “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. The following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBusiness Update\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 have resulted in significant economic disruption globally. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe.\nThis has in turn significantly reduced global economic activity, including a dramatic reduction in airline flights and a decrease in motor vehicle use. As a result, there has been a decline in the demand for the refined petroleum products that we manufacture and sell, which coupled with a decline in the price of crude oil for most of 2020 resulted in a significant decrease in the price and volume of our production and sales of refined petroleum products.\nDuring 2020, there were significant variations in the market prices of products held in our inventories. In each quarter of 2020, these variations required us to record either inventory valuation charges or benefits to reflect the valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market.\nWe have been and continue to actively respond to the impacts that these matters are having on our business. Our response has focused on establishing three strategic short-term priorities:\nStrengthen Competitive Position of Assets\nWe are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational, financial, and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio. Our goal is that each individual asset generates free-cash-flow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns. With our investments we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio, including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves.\nImprove Commercial Performance\nWe are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions, and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance.\nLower Cost Structure\nWe are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and driving operational improvements. In response to the pandemic, in March of 2020, we committed to immediately reducing our capital spending and operating expenses. We accomplished our goal of significantly reducing our capital spending levels by over $1.4 billion from our initial 2020 plans. We also reduced our 2020 forecasted operating expenses by more than our target of $950 million.\nIn connection with these three strategic short-term priorities, in the third quarter of 2020 we announced strategic actions to lay a foundation for long-term success, including plans to optimize our assets and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond. These actions included indefinitely idling the Gallup refinery, initiating actions to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and the approval of an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n49\nIn addition to these measures to address our operations, throughout the year we took action to address our liquidity as outlined below:\n•\nShare repurchases were temporarily suspended. The timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions.\n•\nOn April 27, 2020, we entered into an additional $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which expires in 2021, to provide incremental liquidity and financial flexibility during the commodity price and demand downturn. In February 2021, we elected to terminate this credit agreement as we no longer believe the facility is necessary as an additional source for liquidity, and we do not intend to replace it.\n•\nOn April 27, 2020, we closed on the issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes. Proceeds from the senior notes were used to pay down certain amounts outstanding on the five-year revolving credit facility.\n•\nDuring June 2020, we repaid the remaining amounts outstanding on the five-year revolving credit facility.\n•\nOn September 23, 2020, we entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement, which provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in September 2021, and which replaced a similar 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired on September 28, 2020.\n•\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $6.73 billion available on our variable credit facilities, net of commercial paper borrowings of $1.02 billion.\nMany uncertainties remain with respect to COVID-19, including its resulting economic effects, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from COVID-19 and how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic ultimately subsides. However, the adverse impact of the economic effects on MPC has been and will likely continue to be significant. We believe we have proactively addressed many of the known impacts of COVID-19 to the extent possible and will strive to continue to do so, but there can be no guarantee the measures will be fully effective.\nOther Strategic Updates\nThe Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable fuels facility began ramping operations at the end of 2020 and is on-track to reach full production by the end of the first quarter of 2021. At full capacity, the facility is expected to produce 184 million gallons per year of renewable diesel from corn and soybean oil. MPC intends to sell the renewable diesel into the California market to comply with the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we also progressed activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers, and beginning detailed engineering activities. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.  On February 24, 2021, MPC’s board of directors approved these plans.\nOn November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of its outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, 1,473,843 MPLX common units were repurchased at an average cost per unit of $22.29. Total cash paid for units repurchased during the year was $33 million and $967 million of repurchase authorization remained outstanding on the program as of December 31, 2020.\n50\nResults\nSelect results for continuing operations for 2020 and 2019 are reflected in the following table.\n(a)\nIncludes LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million for 2020.\n(b)\nReflects corporate costs of $26 million and $28 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, that are no longer allocated to Speedway under discontinued operations accounting.\n(c)\n2020 reflects impairments of goodwill, equity method investments and long-lived assets. 2019 reflects impairments of goodwill and equity method investments.\n(d)\n2020 restructuring expense include $195 million for exit costs related to the Martinez and Gallup refineries and $172 million of employee separation costs.\n(e)\n2020 and 2019 include costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts. 2019 includes employee severance, retention and other costs related to the acquisition of Andeavor. Effective October 1, 2019, we discontinued reporting Andeavor transaction-related costs as one year has passed since the acquisition and these costs are immaterial. Costs incurred in connection with the Speedway separation are included in discontinued operations.\nSelect results for discontinued operations are reflected in the following table.\n(a)\nAs of August 2, 2020, MPC ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway. Asset write-offs and retirement charges, which totaled $7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, are presented as depreciation and amortization in our financial statements. Speedway depreciation and amortization was $244 million and $413 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b)\nCosts related to the Speedway separation.\n51\nThe following table includes net income (loss) per diluted share data.\nDuring 2020, actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction in the areas where we operate which impacted demand for our products. Net income attributable to MPC decreased $12.46 billion, or $19.10 per diluted share, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a loss in our Refining & Marketing segment, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges of $8.43 billion and impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion during the period primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices, and\nrestructuring expenses of $367 million\nrelated to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction.\nThe loss from operations in our Refining & Marketing segment is primarily due to decreases in refined product sales volumes, prices and margins during 2020 and includes a charge of $561 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 to reflect a LIFO liquidation for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers which were liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in increased cost of revenues and decreased income from operations. These results were partially offset by increased income from discontinued operations, which relates to Speedway, in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to higher fuel margins partially offset by lower fuel volumes. In addition, as of August 2, 2020, MPC ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 for additional information on discontinued operations.\nRefer to the Results of Operations section for a discussion of financial results by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2020.\nMPLX\nWe received limited partner distributions of $1.79 billion and $1.82 billion from MPLX and Andeavor Logistics LP (“ANDX”) during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe owned approximately 647 million MPLX common units at December 31, 2020 with a market value of $14.02 billion based on the December 31, 2020 closing unit price of $21.65. On January 28, 2021, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6875 per common unit, which was paid February 12, 2021. As a result, MPLX made distributions totaling $714 million to its common unitholders. MPC’s portion of this distribution was approximately $445 million.\nOn July 31, 2020, Western Refining Southwest, Inc. (now known as Western Refining Southwest LLC) (“WRSW”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPC, entered into a Redemption Agreement (the “Redemption Agreement”) with MPLX, pursuant to which MPLX transferred to WRSW all of the outstanding membership interests in Western Refining Wholesale, LLC, (“WRW”) in exchange for the redemption of MPLX common units held by WRSW. The transaction effected the transfer to MPC of the Western wholesale distribution business that MPLX acquired as a result of its acquisition of ANDX. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, the results of these operations are presented in MPC’s Refining & Marketing segment.\nAt the closing, per the terms of Redemption Agreement, MPLX redeemed 18,582,088 MPLX common units held by WRSW. The number of redeemed units was calculated by dividing WRW’s aggregate valuation of $340 million by the simple average of the volume weighted average New York Stock Exchange prices of an MPLX common unit for the ten trading days ending at market close on July 27, 2020. The transaction resulted in a minor decrease in MPC’s ownership interest in MPLX.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 for additional information on MPLX.\n52\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity, excluding MPLX, totaled $7.3 billion at December 31, 2020 consisting of:\n(a)\nOutstanding borrowings include $1 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility. Excludes MPLX’s $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $175 million borrowings and no of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\n(b)\nIn February 2021, we elected to cancel one of the $1.0 B 364-day revolving credit agreements prior to its maturity in April 2021.\n(c)\nAvailability under our $750 million trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products.\n(d)\nWe do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under bank revolving credit facilities.\n(e)\nIncludes cash and cash equivalents classified as assets held for sale of $140 million (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5) and excludes $15 million of MPLX cash and cash equivalents.\nOn November 15, 2020, all of the $650 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 3.400% senior notes due December 2020 were redeemed at a price equal to par.\nOn October 1, 2020, all of the $475 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due October 2022, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par.\nMPLX’s liquidity totaled $4.84 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX had cash and cash equivalents of $15 million, $3.33 billion available under its $3.5 billion revolving credit agreement and $1.5 billion available through its intercompany loan agreement with MPC.\nOn December 29, 2020, MPLX announced the redemption of all the $750 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due January 2025. The notes were redeemed on January 15, 2021 at a price equal to 102.625% of the principal amount. These notes are included in long-term debt due within one year in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for information on our new bank revolving credit facilities.\nOVERVIEW OF SEGMENTS\nRefining & Marketing\nRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing margin, refining operating costs, refining planned turnarounds, distribution costs, depreciation expenses and refinery throughputs. Our total refining capacity was 2,874 mbpcd, 3,067 mbpcd and 3,021 mbpcd as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur Refining & Marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison\n53\nwith other industry participants, we calculate Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. The following will be used for these crack-spread calculations:\n•\nThe Gulf Coast crack spread uses three barrels of LLS crude producing two barrels of USGC CBOB gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD;\n•\nThe Mid-Continent crack spread uses three barrels of WTI crude producing two barrels of Chicago CBOB gasoline and one barrel of Chicago ULSD; and\n•\nThe West Coast crack spread uses three barrels of ANS crude producing two barrels of LA CARBOB and one barrel of LA CARB Diesel.\nOur refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads. The amount of these discounts, which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads. In general, larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our Refining & Marketing margin.\nFuture crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.\nThe following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.\n(a)\nCrack spread based on 40 percent LLS, 40 percent WTI and 20 percent ANS with Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast product pricing, respectively, and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.\n(b)\nSour crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: ANS, Argus Sour Crude Index, Maya and Western Canadian Select. We expect approximately 51 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2021 will be sour crude.\n(c)\nSweet crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: Bakken, Brent, LLS, WTI-Cushing and WTI-Midland. We expect approximately 49 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2021 will be sweet crude.\n(d)\nThis is consumption based exposure for our Refining & Marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our Midstream segment.\nIn addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sour differential and the sweet differential, our Refining & Marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:\n•\nthe selling prices realized for refined products;\n•\nthe types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;\n•\nour refinery yields;\n•\nthe cost of products purchased for resale;\n•\nthe impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;\n•\nthe potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices: and\n•\nthe potential impact of LIFO liquidation charges due to draw-downs from historic inventory levels.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the LIFO inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. At December 31, 2020, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no LCM inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.\n54\nRefining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs and refining planned turnaround costs in addition to committed distribution costs. Changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Refining planned turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Distribution costs primarily include long-term agreements with MPLX, as discussed below, which are based on committed volumes and will negatively impact income from operations in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled.\nThe following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years and only reflects the activity for the acquired refineries after October 1, 2018.\nWe have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX. Under these agreements, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our Refining & Marketing segment. Certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. Certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets.\nMidstream\nOur Midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products, principally for our Refining & Marketing segment. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. The profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. The profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our Refining & Marketing segment.\nAs discussed above in the Refining & Marketing section, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, has various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment. Under these agreements, MPLX has received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.\nOur Midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and NGLs. NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our Midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing\n55\nand selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. These amounts include the results of Andeavor from the October 1, 2018 acquisition date forward. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(a)\nIn accordance with discontinued operations accounting, Speedway sales to retail customers and net results are reflected in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and Refining & Marketing intercompany sales to Speedway are now presented as third-party sales for all periods presented.\n(b)\n2020 includes $1.32 billion of impairment expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 for further information.\n56\n2020 Compared to 2019\nNet income (loss) attributable to MPC decreased $12.46 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to impairment expenses for goodwill and long-lived assets of $8.43 billion, impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion, decreased refined product sales volumes, prices and margin, a charge of $561 million to reflect a LIFO liquidation in our crude oil and refined product inventories and restructuring expenses of $367 million. These changes were partially offset by reduced operating costs and increased income from discontinued operations, which represents Speedway. See Segment Results for additional information.\nTotal revenues and other income decreased $42.83 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n•\ndecreased sales and other operating revenues of $41.37 billion primarily due to decreased Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, or 14 percent, and lower average refined product sales prices, which decreased $0.55 per gallon, or 31 percent, largely due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\ndecreased income from equity method investments of $1.25 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices; and\n•\ndecreased net gain on disposal of assets of $208 million mainly due to the absence of $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline Pipeline Company LLC (“Capline LLC”) and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019. This decrease was offset by net gains on disposal of assets in 2020 largely due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets.\nTotal costs and expenses decreased $26.12 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n•\ndecreased cost of revenues of $33.50 billion primarily due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $561 million to reflect LIFO liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in the LIFO liquidation charge;\n•\nimpairment expense of $8.43 billion recorded in 2020 for goodwill and long-lived assets of $7.39 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices. It also includes impairment of long-lived assets primarily related to the repositioning of the Martinez refinery compared to impairment expense of $1.20 billion recorded in 2019 primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition;\n•\ndecreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $482 million mainly due to decreases in salaries and employee-related expenses, transaction-related expenses, credit card processing fees for brand customers and contract services expenses;\n•\nrestructuring expense of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction. See See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 for additional information; and\n•\nincreased other taxes of $107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes of approximately $78 million and $69 million, respectively. Property taxes increased in the current period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the Oil Spill Tax in 2020, which was not in effect for all of 2019. These increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses.\nNet interest and other financial costs increased $136 million largely due to increased MPC borrowings and foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income. We capitalized interest of $129 million in 2020 and $158 million in 2019. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for further details.\nProvision for income taxes decreased $3.21 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of $16.85 billion. The effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected net operating\n57\nloss carryback provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. Additionally, our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 for further details.\nNoncontrolling interests decreased $769 million mainly due to MPLX’s net loss primarily resulting from impairment expense recognized during 2020.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nNet income attributable to MPC decreased $143 million primarily due to impairment expense of $1.20 billion and an increase in net interest and other financial costs, partially offset by a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and increased income from discontinued operations in 2019. See Segment Results for additional information.\nTotal revenues and other income increased $25.28 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n•\nincreased sales and other operating revenues of $25.06 billion mainly due to an increase in our Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which increased 1,032 mbpd largely due to the Andeavor acquisition on October 1, 2018, partially offset by lower average refined product sales prices, which decreased $0.09 per gallon; and\n•\nincreased net gain on disposal of assets of $272 million mainly due to $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline LLC and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019.\nTotal costs and expenses increased $25.50 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to:\n•\nincreased cost of revenues of $22.18 billion primarily due to the inclusion of costs related to the Andeavor operations following the acquisition;\n•\nincreased impairment expense of $1.20 billion primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition;\n•\nincreased depreciation and amortization of $1.06 billion, primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the Andeavor acquisition;\n•\nincreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $916 million mainly due to the inclusion of costs related to Andeavor operations following the acquisition and reflecting MPC’s classification of those costs and expenses; and\n•\nincreased other taxes of $155 million primarily due to the inclusion of other taxes related to the acquired Andeavor operations.\nNet interest and other financial costs increased $236 million mainly due to debt assumed in the acquisition of Andeavor and increased MPLX borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement losses of $44 million. We capitalized interest of $158 million in 2019 and $80 million in 2018. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for further details.\nProvision for income taxes on continuing operations increased $20 million primarily due to non-deductible goodwill impairments partially offset by decreased income from continuing operations $464 million. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The effective tax rate of 21 percent in 2018 is consistent with the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, as permanent benefit differences related to income attributable to noncontrolling interest were offset by state and local tax expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 for further details.\nNoncontrolling interests decreased $214 million mainly due lower MPLX net income primarily as a result of the $1.2 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2019.\n58\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nThe results of Speedway are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following includes key financial and operating data for Speedway for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n(a)\nThe price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, excluding transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees (where applicable), divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume.\n(b)\nSee “Non-GAAP Measures” section for reconciliation and further information regarding this non-GAAP measure.\n(c)\nThe price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise.\n(d)\nSame store comparison includes only locations owned at least 13 months.\n(e)\nExcludes cigarettes.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $399 million primarily due to higher fuel margins partially offset by lower fuel volumes. Changes in fuel sales volumes were primarily due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in restricted travel, social distancing and reduced business operations. In addition, fuel sales volumes decreased as a result of an agreement between Speedway and Pilot Travel Centers (“PTC”), effective October 1, 2019, in which PTC supplies, prices and sells diesel fuel at certain Speedway and PTC locations with both companies sharing in the diesel fuel margins.\nBeginning August 2, 2020, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway’s property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use lease assets. As a result, Speedway depreciation and amortization was $244 million and $413 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Speedway fuel margin increased to 34.52 cents per gallon in 2020 compared with 24.34 cents per gallon in 2019.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $133 million primarily due to higher fuel and merchandise margins largely related to the addition of the Andeavor retail operations. These increases were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and depreciation primarily related to the locations acquired from Andeavor.\nThe Speedway fuel margin increased to 24.34 cents per gallon in 2019 compared with 21.22 cents per gallon in 2018.\n59\nSegment Results\nOur Refining & Marketing and Midstream segment income (loss) from continuing operations was approximately $(1.48) billion, $6.45 billion and $5.41 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nRefining & Marketing\nBeginning with the third quarter of 2020, the direct dealer business is managed as part of the Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Refining & Marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented.\nThe following includes key financial and operating data for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our results include the results of Andeavor from the October 1, 2018 acquisition date forward.\n(a)\nIncludes intersegment sales to Midstream and sales destined for export.\n60\n(a)\nIncludes direct dealer results due to our third quarter change in segment presentation.\n(b)\nSales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by net refinery throughput.\n(c)\nSee “Non-GAAP Measures” section for reconciliation and further information regarding this non-GAAP measure.\n(d)\nIncludes refining operating and major maintenance costs. Excludes planned turnaround and depreciation and amortization expense.\n(e)\nReflects a benefit of $93 million in 2019 for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018.\n(f)\nIncludes income from equity method investments, net gain on disposal of assets and other income.\n61\nThe following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Andeavor businesses are only included in our results from October 1, 2018 forward. The benchmark crack spreads below do not reflect the market cost of RINs necessary to meet EPA renewable volume obligations for attributable products under the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n(a)\nThe blended crack spread for the fourth quarter of 2020 is weighted 40 percent of the USGC crack spread, 40 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 20 percent of the West Coast crack spread. The blended crack spreads for the first three quarters of 2020, all of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018 are weighted 38 percent of the USGC crack spread, 38 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 24 percent of the West Coast crack spread. The blended crack spread for the first three quarters of 2018 reflects the average weighting of 60 percent of the USGC crack spread and 40 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread. These blends are based on MPC’s refining capacity by region in each period.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nRefining & Marketing segment revenues decreased $41.16 billion primarily due to lower refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, and decreased average refined product sales prices of $0.55 per gallon.\nRefinery crude oil capacity utilization was 82 percent during 2020 and net refinery throughputs decreased 529 mbpd primarily due to reducing throughputs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRefining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $8.05 billion primarily driven by lower blended crack spreads.\nRefining & Marketing margin, excluding LIFO liquidation charge, was $8.96 per barrel for 2020 compared to $14.77 per barrel for 2019. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net negative impact of $9.75 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to lower crack spreads. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2020, a LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of\n62\napproximately $800 million, including the LIFO liquidation charge, in 2020 compared to 2019 resulting in a capture rate of 102 percent in 2020 and 96 percent in 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.37 billion. This was a decrease of $1.06 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.02 due to lower refinery throughput, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, including operating at lower throughput at our refineries and idling portions of our refining capacity. Net refinery throughput was 529 mbpd lower in 2020\nDistribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.08 billion and $5.13 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.46 billion and $3.22 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a per barrel basis, distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $0.85 primarily due to lower throughput partially offset by a decrease in costs.\nRefining planned turnaround costs increased $92 million, or $0.23 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity and a decrease in throughput.\nDepreciation and amortization per barrel increased by $0.38, primarily due to a decrease in throughput and increased costs.\nWe purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $606 million in 2020 and $356 million in 2019 and are included in Refining & Marketing margin. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs, partially offset by a decrease in our RIN obligations.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nRefining & Marketing segment revenues increased $24.6 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased 1,032 mbpd, largely due to the acquisition of Andeavor on October 1, 2018, partially offset by decreased average refined product sales prices of $.09 per gallon.\nRefinery crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent during 2019 and net refinery throughputs increased 838 mbpd primarily due to the refineries acquired from Andeavor.\nRefining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $202 million primarily due to a full year of direct dealer sales and an increase in Refining & Marketing margin on a per barrel basis partially offset by higher operating, distribution and depreciation and amortization costs. The increases in costs and expenses were primarily due to increased sales and production volumes following the Andeavor acquisition.\nRefining & Marketing margin was $14.77 per barrel for 2019 compared to $14.50 per barrel for 2018. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net positive impact of $4.46 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to an approximate $5.35 billion benefit from increased throughput volume, mainly attributed to the Andeavor acquisition, partially offset by narrower sour and sweet crude oil differentials. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances and direct dealer fuel margin. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of approximately $370 million in 2019 compared to 2018 resulting in a capture rate of 96 percent in 2019 compared to 92 percent in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $6.42 billion. This was an increase of $2.28 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.67. Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.13 billion and $3.52 billion, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.22 billion and $2.28 billion, for 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was an increase of $1.61 billion, or $0.28 per barrel. Excluding depreciation and amortization, refining operating costs and distribution costs increased primarily due to the inclusion of costs for the refining operations acquired from Andeavor. The per barrel increases, among other items, reflect the addition of Andeavor’s West Coast\n63\nrefineries, which generally have higher operating costs than other regions in which we operate due to specific geographical location and regulatory factors.\nRefining planned turnaround costs decreased $76 million, or $0.15 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity.\nDepreciation and amortization per barrel increased by $0.13, primarily due to the fair value of assets acquired from Andeavor as of October 1, 2018. During 2019, we recorded a $0.01 per barrel adjustment to reduce depreciation and amortization, which reflects the cumulative effects related to a measurement period adjustment arising from the finalization of purchase accounting.\nWe purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $356 million in 2019 and $316 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in our RIN obligations resulting from the acquisition of Andeavor, partially offset by lower weighted average RIN costs.\nSupplemental Refining & Marketing Statistics\n(a)\nRepresents fully loaded export cargoes for each time period. These sales volumes are included in the total sales volumes amounts.\n(b)\nBased on calendar-day capacity, which is an annual average that includes down time for planned maintenance and other normal operating activities.\n64\nMidstream\n(a)\nOn owned common-carrier pipelines, excluding equity method investments.\n(b)\nIncludes amounts related to unconsolidated equity method investments on a 100 percent basis.\n65\n(a)\nC2 + NGL pricing based on Mont Belvieu prices assuming an NGL barrel of approximately 35 percent ethane, 35 percent propane, six percent Iso-Butane, 12 percent normal butane and 12 percent natural gasoline.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nMidstream segment revenue decreased $322 million primarily due to decreased demand for the products that we produce and transport due to the current macro-economic conditions in addition to lower natural gas prices.\nIn 2020, Midstream segment income from operations increased $114 million mainly due stable, fee-based earnings in the current business environment, contributions from organic growth projects and reduced operating expenses.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nMidstream segment revenue increased $2.10 billion primarily due to the inclusion of ANDX revenues subsequent to the Andeavor acquisition on October 1, 2018. On July 30, 2019, MPLX acquired ANDX. In addition, 2019 reflects twelve months of fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment following the February 1, 2018 dropdown to MPLX. MPLX revenues from refining logistics and fuels distribution services provided to MPC were $1.48 billion and $1.36 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn 2019, Midstream segment income from operations increased $842 million largely due to contributions from ANDX in addition to growth across MPLX’s businesses.\nCorporate\n(a)\nCorporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of MPC’s corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets, except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX, which are included in the Midstream segment. Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing segment.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nCorporate expenses decreased $33 million in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to decreased salaries and contract services expenses, partially offset by increased expenses due to an information systems integration project. 2020 and 2019 corporate expenses include expenses of $26 million and $28 million, respectively, which are no longer allocable to Speedway due to discontinued operations accounting.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nCorporate expenses increased $305 million in 2019 compared to 2018 largely due to the inclusion of costs and expenses related to Andeavor operations. 2019 and 2018 corporate expenses include expenses of $28 million and $26 million, respectively, which are no longer allocable to Speedway due to discontinued operations accounting.\n66\nItems not Allocated to Segments\nOur chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments using segment income from operations. Items identified in the table below are either believed to be non-recurring in nature or not believed to be allocable, controlled by the segment or are not tied to the operational performance of the segment.\n(a)\n2020 and 2019 includes costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts. Both 2019 and 2018 include employee severance, retention and other costs related to the acquisition of Andeavor. Effective October 1, 2019, we have discontinued reporting Andeavor transaction-related costs as one year has passed since the acquisition and these costs are immaterial. Costs incurred in connection with the Speedway separation are included in discontinued operations.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nUnallocated items include impairment charges of $9.74 billion which includes $8.43 billion related to goodwill and long-lived assets and $1.32 billion related to equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 for additional information.\nDuring 2020, we indefinitely idled our Gallup refinery, initiated actions to strategically reposition our Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and approved an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 for additional information.\nOther unallocated items in 2020 include a favorable litigation settlement of $84 million and gain on sale of assets of $66 million related to the sale of three asphalt terminals and certain other Refining & Marketing assets.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nUnallocated items in 2019 include $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline LLC and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 for additional information.\nIn 2019, other unallocated items also include transaction-related costs of $153 million and a litigation reserve adjustment of $22 million. The transaction-related costs recognized during the year include the recognition of an obligation for vacation benefits provided to former Andeavor employees in the first quarter as well as employee retention, severance and other costs and the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts.\nImpairment charges of $1.24 billion in 2019 primarily relate to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 for additional information.\n67\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable GAAP financial measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are as follows:\nRefining & Marketing Margin\nRefining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes other items reflected in the table below.\nReconciliation of Refining & Marketing income from operations to Refining & Marketing gross margin and Refining & Marketing margin\n(a)\nThe gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, of operations that support Refining & Marketing such as biodiesel and ethanol ventures, power facilities and processing of credit card transactions.\nSpeedway Fuel Margin\nSpeedway fuel margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees (where applicable).\nSpeedway Merchandise Margin\nSpeedway merchandise margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise.\n68\nReconciliation of Speedway income from discontinued operations to Speedway gross margin and Speedway margin\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash Flows\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $415 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2019, excluding $140 million and $134 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents related to the discontinued operations of Speedway which are included in assets held for sale. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $7.02 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results and an unfavorable change in working capital of $43 million. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3.28 billion in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in operating results, excluding impairment expenses, and a favorable change in working capital of $978 million. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.\nFor 2020, changes in working capital were a net $314 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices and inventory and refined product volumes on working capital. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude payable prices. Current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude and refined product receivable prices and refined product volumes. Inventories decreased mainly due to decreases in refined product, crude and materials & supplies inventories.\nFor 2019, changes in working capital were a net $357 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices and volumes on working capital. Accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable price and volumes. Current receivables increased primarily due to\n69\nincreases in crude and refined product receivable volumes and prices. Inventories increased primarily due to increases in refined product and materials & supplies inventories partially offset by a decrease in crude inventory.\nFor 2018, changes in working capital were a net $621 million use of cash, primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices on working capital. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices. Inventories decreased primarily due to a decrease in crude and refined product inventories. Current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude oil receivable prices. All of these effects exclude the working capital acquired in connection with the acquisition of Andeavor.\nCash flows used in investing activities decreased $3.00 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 and decreased $1.41 billion in 2019 compared to 2018.\n•\nCash used for additions to property, plant and equipment was primarily due to spending in our Midstream and Refining & Marketing segments in 2020. See discussion of capital expenditures and investments under the “Capital Spending” section.\n•\nCash used for acquisitions of $3.82 billion in 2018 primarily includes cash paid to Andeavor stockholders of $3.5 billion in connection with the acquisition of Andeavor on October 1, 2018.\n•\nNet investments were a use of cash of $348 million in 2020 compared to $966 million in 2019 and $393 million in 2018. Investments in 2020 are largely due to investments in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the Gray Oak Pipeline and the Whistler Pipeline. Investments in 2019 are largely due to investments in connection with the Gray Oak Pipeline, which began initial start-up in the fourth quarter, the Wink to Webster Pipeline, the Whistler Pipeline and other Midstream projects.\n•\nCash provided by disposal of assets totaled $150 million, $47 million and $22 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2020 is mainly due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets. The increase in 2019 is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of assets in our Retail segment.\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years.\nFinancing activities were a use of cash of $135 million in 2020, a use of cash of $3.38 billion in 2019 and a source of cash of $222 million in 2018.\n•\nLong-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $1.65 billion source of cash in 2020 compared to a $1.18 billion source of cash in 2019 and a $5.36 billion source of cash in 2018. During 2020, MPC issued $2.5 billion of senior notes, redeemed $1.13 billion of senior notes, borrowed and repaid $4.23 billion under its revolving credit facility, borrowed and repaid $3.55 billion under its trade receivables facility and had net borrowings of $1.02 billion under its commercial paper program. MPLX issued $3.0 billion of senior notes, which were used to repay $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under its term loan, $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and to redeem $750 million of fixed rate senior notes, and had net borrowings of $175 million under its revolving credit facility. During 2019, MPLX issued $2 billion of floating rate notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay various outstanding MPLX borrowings and for general business purposes, and had net borrowings of $1 billion under its term loan agreement. In addition, MPLX repaid $500 million of senior notes. During 2018, MPLX issued $7.75 billion of senior notes, redeemed $750 million of senior notes, borrowed and repaid $4.1 billion under a term loan agreement, and borrowed and repaid $1.41 billion and $1.92 billion,\n70\nrespectively, under the MPLX Credit Agreement. In addition, MPC redeemed $600 million of senior notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for additional information on our long-term debt.\n•\nCash used in common stock repurchases totaled $1.95 billion in 2019 and $3.29 billion in 2018. See the “Capital Requirements” section for further discussion of our stock repurchases.\n•\nCash used in dividend payments totaled $1.51 billion in 2020, $1.40 billion in 2019 and $954 million in 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to an increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases in 2019. The increase in 2019 was primarily due a net increase in the number of shares outstanding due to the approximate 239.8 million shares issued in connection with the Andeavor acquisition and a $0.28 per share increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases. Dividends per share were $2.32 in 2020, $2.12 in 2019 and $1.84 in 2018.\n•\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests increased $342 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to increases in MPLX units outstanding and MPLX’s distribution per common unit. Distributions to noncontrolling interests included ANDX’s distribution per common unit paid in the first and second quarter of 2019, prior to the merger of ANDX and MPLX, and the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the acquisition of Andeavor on October 1, 2018.\nDerivative Instruments\nSee Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.\nCapital Resources\nMPC, Excluding MPLX\nWe control MPLX through our ownership of the general partner, however, the creditors of MPLX do not have recourse to MPC’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements. The assets of MPLX can only be used to settle its own obligations and its creditors have no recourse to our assets. Therefore, in the following table, we present the liquidity of MPC, excluding MPLX. MPLX liquidity is discussed in the following section.\nOur liquidity, excluding MPLX, totaled $7.3 billion at December 31, 2020 consisting of:\n(a)\nOutstanding borrowings include $1 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility. Excludes MPLX’s $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $175 million borrowings and no of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\n(b)\nIn February 2021, we elected to cancel one of the $1.0 B 364-day revolving credit agreements prior to its maturity in April 2021.\n(c)\nAvailability under our $750 million trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products.\n(d)\nWe do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under bank revolving credit facilities.\n(e)\nIncludes cash and cash equivalents classified as assets held for sale of $140 million (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5) and excludes $15 million of MPLX cash and cash equivalents.\nBecause of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions,\n71\nrepayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. During the year ended December 31, 2020, share repurchases were temporarily suspended, which has helped preserve our liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nOn August 2, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven for $21 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. This transaction is expected to result in after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $16.5 billion. The company expects to use the proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.\nAdditionally, we have recorded an income tax receivable within other current assets in our balance sheet of approximately $2.1 billion which is expected to be received during the second half of 2021.\nWe established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2020, we had $1.02 billion outstanding under the commercial paper program, which matures on various dates in the first quarter of 2021.\nOn September 23, 2020, MPC entered into a 364-day credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. This revolving credit agreement provides for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in September 2021, and replaces a similar 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired on September 28, 2020.\nOn April 27, 2020, MPC entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement that provided for a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature in April 2021. In February 2021, we elected to terminate this credit agreement. This facility provided MPC additional liquidity and financial flexibility during the then ongoing commodity price and demand downturn. We no longer believe the facility is necessary as an additional source for liquidity, and we do not intend to replace it. No early termination fees were incurred by MPC in connection with the termination of this credit agreement.\nOn April 27, 2020, we closed on the issuance of $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% unsecured senior notes due May 2023 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700% unsecured senior notes due May 2025. MPC used the net proceeds from this offering to repay amounts outstanding under its five-year revolving credit facility.\nThe MPC credit agreements and our trade receivables facility contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC credit agreements) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. Other covenants restrict us and/or certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPC credit agreements and our trade receivables facility, including the financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.37 to 1.00.\nOur intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. As of February 1, 2021, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt are as follows.\nThe ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue\n72\nfor any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.\nNone of the MPC credit agreements or our trade receivables facility or senior notes contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements and may limit our flexibility to obtain financing in the future, including to refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for further discussion of our debt.\nMPLX\nMPLX’s liquidity totaled $4.84 billion at December 31, 2020 consisting of:\nOn August 18, 2020, MPLX issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.750% senior notes due March 2026 and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.650% senior notes due August 2030. The net proceeds were used to repay $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under the MPLX term loan agreement, to repay the $1.0 billion floating rate senior notes due September 2021, to redeem all of the $300 million aggregate principal amount of MPLX’s 6.250% senior notes due October 2022 and to redeem the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due May 2024, including the portion of such notes issued by ANDX. The remaining proceeds were used for general business purposes.\nThe MPLX credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. The financial covenant requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict MPLX and/or certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX was in compliance with the covenants, including the financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.8 to 1.0.\nOur intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile for MPLX. As of February 1, 2021, the credit ratings on MPLX’s senior unsecured debt are as follows.\nThe ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating for MPLX, there is no assurance that these ratings\n73\nwill continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.\nNeither the MPLX credit agreement or term loan agreement contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that MPLX credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of MPLX senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements. In addition, a downgrade of MPLX senior unsecured debt ratings to below investment-grade levels may limit MPLX’s ability to obtain future financing, including to refinance existing indebtedness.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for further discussion of MPLX’s debt.\nCapital Requirements\nCapital Spending\nMPC’s capital investment plan for 2021 totals approximately $1.4 billion for capital projects and investments, excluding capitalized interest, potential acquisitions and MPLX’s capital investment plan. MPC’s 2021 capital investment plan includes all of the planned capital spending for Refining & Marketing, and Corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments in Midstream and Speedway’s capital spending for the first quarter which is now reported separately as discontinued operations. The remainder of the planned capital spending for Midstream reflects the capital investment plan for MPLX. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. The 2021 capital investment plan for MPC and MPLX and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below.\n(a)\nCapital expenditures exclude changes in capital accruals.\n(b)\nExcludes capitalized interest of $106 million, $137 million and $80 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2021 capital investment plan excludes capitalized interest.\n(c)\nThe MPLX capital investment plan excludes project reimbursements paid by MPC to MPLX and return of capital from MPLX’s joint venture partners.\nRefining & Marketing\nThe Refining & Marketing segment’s forecasted 2021 capital spending and investments is approximately $1.05 billion. This amount includes approximately $800 million of growth capital focused on on-going projects, such as the first phase of the Martinez facility conversion, the STAR project, and projects that we expect will help us reduce future operating costs. Maintenance capital is expected to be $250 million.\nMajor capital projects completed over the last three years have prepared us to increase our diesel production, process light crude oil, increase our export capabilities and meet the transportation fuel regulatory mandate (Tier 3 fuel standards). In addition, the STAR investment project at our Galveston Bay refinery is progressing according to plan and is scheduled to complete in 2022.\nMidstream\nMPLX’s capital investment plan includes $800 million of organic growth capital and approximately $200 million of maintenance capital. This growth plan is focused on investments in projects that deliver the highest returns as we continue to optimize our assets. These investments are focused on crude oil and natural gas logistics systems to transport products from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf Coast and increase our\n74\nexport capabilities. This provides for additional flexibility and competitive advantages in how we operate our assets as these projects further enhance our full value chain capture. Other investments include the addition of approximately 400 MMcf/d of processing capacity at two gas processing plants, one in the Marcellus region which is expected to be completed in 2021, and one in the Southwest region, which is expected to be completed in 2022.\nMajor capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure to support MPLX’s producer customers, primarily in the Marcellus, Utica and Permian regions and development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects.\nThe remaining Midstream\nsegment’s forecasted 2021 capital spend, excluding MPLX, is approximately $50 million which primarily relates to investments in equity affiliates.\nCorporate and Other\nThe 2021 capital forecast includes approximately $150 million to support corporate activities. Major projects over the last three years included upgrades to information technology systems.\nSpeedway\nSpeedway’s 2021 capital forecast for the first quarter of approximately $150 million is focused on new store growth in existing and new markets, commercial fueling/diesel expansion, food service through store remodels and equipment replacement/store maintenance.\nMajor capital projects over the last three years included converting recently acquired locations to the Speedway brand and systems, building new store locations, remodeling and rebuilding existing locations in core markets and building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations to capitalize on diesel demand growth.\nDividends\nOn January 29, 2021, we announced our board of directors approved a $0.58 per share dividend, payable March 10, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2021.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, share repurchases were temporarily suspended, which has helped preserve our liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic. The timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $18.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $15.0 billion of our common stock, leaving approximately $3.0 billion available for repurchases as of December 31, 2020. Under these authorizations, we have acquired 327 million shares at an average cost per share of $46.05. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.\nWe may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans.\nMPLX Unit Repurchases\nOn November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the board authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of MPLX’s outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon\n75\nseveral factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, 1,473,843 MPLX common units had been repurchased at an average cost per unit of $22.29. Total cash paid for units repurchased during the year was $33 million and $967 million remained outstanding on the program for future repurchases as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX had agreements to acquire 99,406 additional common units for $2 million, which settled in early January 2021.\nOther Capital Requirements\nIn 2020, we made contributions totaling $3 million to our funded pension plans. For 2021, we have $65 million of required funding and we may make voluntary contributions to our funded pension plans at our discretion.\nWe have $1.0 billion of 5.125 percent senior notes due in March 2021 that will be paid utilizing existing resources.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $141 million of restructuring expenses were accrued as restructuring reserves in our consolidated balance sheet and we expect cash payments for the majority of these reserves to occur within the next nine months.\nWe may, from time to time, repurchase notes in the open market, in tender offers, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.\n76\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2020. The contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to MPLX under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n(a)\nIncludes interest payments of $16.59 billion for our senior notes and the MPLX senior notes, commitment and administrative fees for our credit agreements, the MPLX credit agreement and term loan agreement and our trade receivables facility.\n(b)\nFinance lease obligations represent future minimum payments.\n(c)\nIncludes both short- and long-term purchases obligations.\n(d)\nThese contracts include variable price arrangements. For purposes of this disclosure we have estimated prices to be paid primarily based on futures curves for the commodities to the extent available.\n(e)\nPrimarily includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.\n(f)\nPrimarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2030. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 26.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.\nWe have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 29.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted on terms comparable to those with unaffiliated parties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 10 for discussion of activity with related parties.\n77\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS\nWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nLegislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers.\nOur environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were:\n(a)\nBased on the American Petroleum Institute’s definition of environmental expenditures.\n(b)\nThese amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.\nWe accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.\nNew or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. It is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.\nOur environmental capital expenditures accounted for 6 percent, 12 percent and 11 percent of capital expenditures, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, excluding acquisitions. Our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $39 million, or 2 percent, of total planned capital expenditures in 2021. Actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.\nFor more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business\n–\nRegulatory Matters and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n78\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\nFair Value Estimates\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.\nThe fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 – Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n•\nLevel 2 – Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.\n•\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.\nValuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.\nSignificant uses of fair value measurements include:\n•\nassessment of impairment of long-lived assets;\n•\nassessment of impairment of intangible assets:\n•\nassessment of impairment of goodwill;\n•\nassessment of impairment of equity method investments;\n•\nrecorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and\n•\nrecorded values of derivative instruments.\n79\nImpairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments\nFair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including:\n•\nFuture operating performance\n. Our estimates of future operating performance are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.\n•\nFuture volumes\n. Our estimates of future refinery, pipeline throughput and natural gas and natural gas liquid processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments operations personnel. Assumptions about the effects of COVID-19 on our future volumes are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic, which is difficult to forecast.\n•\nDiscount rate commensurate with the risks involved\n. We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.\n•\nFuture capital requirements\n. These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.\nAssumptions about the effects of COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the macroeconomic environment, which is difficult to forecast. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections.\nThe need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a weakened outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or natural gas liquids processed, a significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment. The following sections detail our critical accounting estimates related to impairment assessments for long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment Assessments\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets, and the plant level or pipeline system level for Midstream segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value. The Company’s consolidated long-lived asset balance was $43 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment as a result of decreases to the Refining & Marketing segment expected future cash flows. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and commodity price declines. We assessed each refinery asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of each asset group. Of the 16 refinery asset groups, only the Gallup refinery’s carrying value exceeded its undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows. It was determined that the fair value of the Gallup refinery’s property, plant and equipment was less than the carrying value. As a result, we recorded a charge of $142 million in the first quarter of 2020 to impairment expense on the consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurements for the Gallup refinery assets represent Level 3 measurements.\n80\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment, except the Gallup refinery which had been impaired in the first quarter, as a result of continued macroeconomic developments impacting the Refining & Marketing segment expected future cash flows. All of these refinery asset groups undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded the carrying value by at least 17 percent.\nOn August 3, 2020, we announced our plans to evaluate possibilities to strategically reposition our Martinez refinery, including the potential conversion of the refinery into a renewable diesel facility. Subsequent to August 3, 2020, we progressed activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers, and beginning detailed engineering activities. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. As a result of the progression of these activities, we identified assets that would be repurposed and utilized in a renewable diesel facility configuration and assets that would be abandoned since they had no function in a renewable diesel facility configuration. This change in our intended use for the Martinez refinery is a long-lived asset impairment trigger for the assets that would be repurposed and remain as part of the Martinez asset group. We assessed the asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded the Martinez asset group carrying value. We recorded impairment expense of $342 million for the abandoned assets as we are no longer using these assets and have no expectation to use these assets in the future. Additionally, as a result of our efforts to progress the conversion of Martinez refinery into a renewable diesel facility, MPLX cancelled in-process capital projects related to its Martinez refinery logistics operations resulting in impairments of $27 million in the third quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded the evaluation of our intended use of MPLX terminal assets near the Gallup refinery and determined that the assets were abandoned, resulting in an impairment charge of $67 million. Following this conclusion, we revised the estimate of the salvage value for the Gallup refinery asset group resulting in an additional $44 million impairment charge. These charges are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income.\nThe determination of undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for our long-lived asset impairment tests utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows, allocation of certain Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to the individual refineries, the estimated useful lives of the asset groups, and the salvage values of the refineries. The determinations of expected future cash flows and the salvage values of refineries require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Should our assumptions significantly change in future periods, it is possible we may determine the carrying values of additional refinery asset groups exceed the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows of their refinery asset groups, which would result in future impairment charges.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, MPLX identified an impairment trigger relating to asset groups within its Western Gathering & Processing (“G&P”) reporting unit as a result of significant changes to expected future cash flows for these asset groups resulting from the effects of COVID-19. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by volume declines reflecting decreased forecasted producer customer production as a result of lower commodity prices. MPLX assessed each asset group within the Western G&P reporting unit for impairment. It was determined that the fair value of the East Texas G&P asset group’s underlying assets was less than the carrying value. As a result, MPLX recorded impairment charges totaling $350 million related to its property, plant and equipment and intangibles, which are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income. Fair value of MPLX’s PP&E was determined using a combination of an income and cost approach. The income approach utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows and the estimated useful life of the asset group. The cost approach utilized assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar assets adjusted for estimated depreciation and deterioration of the existing equipment. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions included management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows from existing customers, customer attrition rates and the discount rate. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the\n81\nimpairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the asset group fair values represent Level 3 measurements.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nUnlike long-lived assets, goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing at the reporting unit level. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $8.26 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, which was associated with four of our eight reporting units. An additional reporting unit, Speedway, has goodwill of $4.4 billion and is reported within assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, its development into a pandemic and the decline in commodity prices during the first quarter of 2020 had significant effects on our business. See “Business Update” in Item 1. Business above. Due to these developments, we performed impairment assessments during the first quarter of 2020 as discussed further below.\nPrior to performing our goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2020, we had goodwill totaling approximately $20 billion associated with eight of our 10 reporting units. As part of this assessment, we recorded goodwill impairment of $7.33 billion in the first quarter of 2020 related to our Refining & Marketing and MPLX’s Eastern Gathering & Processing reporting units. The Refining & Marketing and Eastern Gathering & Processing reporting units recorded goodwill impairment charges of $5.52 billion and $1.81 billion, respectively, which fully impaired both reporting units’ historical goodwill balances. These goodwill impairment expenses are primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19, the decline in commodity prices and the slowing of drilling activity which has reduced production growth forecasts from MPLX’s producer customers. For the remaining six reporting units with goodwill, we determined that no significant adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. The impairment assessment performed as of March 31, 2020 resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 8.5 percent to 270.0 percent. MPLX’s Crude Gathering reporting unit had goodwill totaling $1.1 billion at March 31, 2020 and MPLX’s fair value estimate for this reporting unit exceeded the reporting unit carrying value by 8.5 percent. The operations that make up this reporting unit were acquired by MPLX when it acquired ANDX. We accounted for the October 1, 2018 acquisition of Andeavor (through which we acquired control of ANDX), using the acquisition method of accounting, which required Andeavor assets and liabilities to be recorded at the acquisition date fair value. As such, given the short amount of time from when fair value was established to the date of the impairment test, the amount by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value within this reporting unit is not unexpected. An increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as of March 31, 2020. No other reporting units had fair values exceeding carrying values of less than 20 percent.\nPrior to performing our annual impairment assessment as of November 30, 2020, MPC had goodwill totaling approximately $8.26 billion associated with four reporting units. Additionally, a fifth reporting unit, Speedway, is reported in assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and has $4.4 billion of goodwill. Management performed a qualitative assessment for three reporting units as we determined it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values. A quantitative assessment was last performed on these reporting units either on November 30, 2019 or March 31, 2020 and these reporting units’ fair values exceeded carrying values by a range of approximately 90 percent to 270 percent. A quantitative assessment was performed for the remaining two reporting units which resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 9 percent to 42 percent. The reporting unit whose fair value exceeded its carrying amount by 9 percent, our Crude Gathering Reporting unit, had goodwill totaling $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit is consistent with prior assessments. An increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of this reporting unit would not have resulted in goodwill impairment as of November 30, 2020.\nSignificant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets. If estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted by future margins on products produced or sold, future volumes, and capital requirements, were to decline, the overall reporting units’ fair values would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying\n82\nassumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.\nEquity Method Investment Impairment Assessment\nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. During the first quarter of 2020, we recorded $1.32 billion of equity method investment impairment charges to income from equity method investments in the consolidated statements of income. The impairment charges primarily related to MPLX recording an other than temporary impairment totaling $1.26 billion, of which $1.25 billion related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C and its investment in Ohio Gathering Company, L.L.C. The fair value of the investments was determined based upon applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of these equity method investments represents a Level 3 measurement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The impairment was recorded through “Income from equity method investments.” The impairments were largely due to a reduction in forecasted volumes gathered and processed by the systems operated by the joint ventures. At December 31, 2020, we had $5.42 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.\nAn estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 for additional information on our equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles, including a table summarizing our recorded goodwill by segment.\nAcquisitions\nIn accounting for business combinations, acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for valuation assistance.\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent consideration, as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the projected results used to determine fair value.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8 for additional information on our acquisitions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20 for additional information on fair value measurements.\n83\nDerivatives\nWe record all derivative instruments at fair value. Substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. Fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a VIE. Our interests in a VIE are referred to as variable interests. Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE’s assets. When we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated.\nSignificant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support; the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.\nChanges in the design or nature of the activities of a VIE, or our involvement with a VIE, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a VIE and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. Such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. This could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 9.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nAccounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:\n•\nthe discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;\n•\nthe expected long-term return on plan assets;\n•\nthe rate of future increases in compensation levels;\n•\nhealth care cost projections; and\n•\nthe mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.\nWe utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for each of our pension plans and retiree health and welfare based on the projected benefit payment patterns of each individual plan. The selected rates are compared to various similar bond indices for reasonableness. In determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuaries’ discount rate models. These models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from Aa or higher corporate bond yields. The yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used have an average rating of Aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. Outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding.\n84\nOf the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates of 2.55 percent for our pension plans and 2.60 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $110 million and $42 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $15 million and $3 million, respectively.\nThe long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. In addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. We used the 6.00 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2020 defined benefit pension expense. After evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we decreased the asset rate of return for our primary plan to 5.75 percent effective for 2021. Decreasing the 5.75 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percentage points would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $5 million.\nCompensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.\nHealth care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.\nWe utilized the 2020 mortality tables from the U.S. Society of Actuaries.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 26 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED\nAs discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.\n85"

    "text": "General\nWe are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to hedge the risks related to these price fluctuations. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any financial derivative instruments to hedge the risks related to interest rate fluctuations; however, we have used them in the past, and we continually monitor the market and our exposure and may enter into these agreements again in the future. We are at risk for changes in fair value of all of our derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price or rate changes related to the underlying commodity or financial transaction.\nWe believe that our use of derivative instruments, along with our risk assessment procedures and internal controls, does not expose us to material adverse consequences. While the use of derivative instruments could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods, we believe that the use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes 20 and 21 for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nRefining & Marketing\nOur strategy is to obtain competitive prices for our products and allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand. We use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options, as part of an overall program to hedge commodity price risk. We also do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical transactions.\nWe use commodity derivative instruments on crude oil and refined product inventories to hedge price risk associated with inventories above or below LIFO inventory targets. We also use derivative instruments related to the acquisition of foreign-sourced crude oil and ethanol blended with refined petroleum products to hedge price risk associated with market volatility between the time we purchase the product and when we use it in the refinery production process or it is blended. In addition, we may use commodity derivative instruments on fixed price contracts for the sale of refined products to hedge risk by converting the refined product sales to market-based prices. The majority of these derivatives are exchange-traded contracts but we also enter into over-the-counter swaps, options and over-the-counter options. We closely monitor and hedge our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. Our positions are monitored daily by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy.\nMidstream\nNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond MPLX’s control. MPLX may at times use a variety of commodity derivative instruments, including futures and options, as part of an overall program to economically hedge commodity price risk. A portion of MPLX’s profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of purchasing and selling NGLs and natural gas at index-related prices. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of drilling by MPLX producer customers, such prices also indirectly affect profitability. MPLX may enter into derivative contracts, which are primarily swaps traded on the OTC market as well as fixed price forward contracts. MPLX’s risk management policy does not allow it to enter into speculative positions with its derivative contracts. Execution of MPLX’s hedge strategy and the continuous monitoring of commodity markets and its open derivative positions are carried out by its hedge committee, comprised of members of senior management.\nTo mitigate MPLX’s cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of NGLs, it may use NGL derivative swap contracts. A small portion of its NGL price exposure may be managed by using crude oil contracts. To mitigate MPLX’s cash flow exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, it may use natural gas\n86\nderivative swap contracts, taking into account the partial offset of its long and short natural gas positions resulting from normal operating activities.\nMPLX would be exposed to additional commodity risk in certain situations such as if producers under‑deliver or over‑deliver products or if processing facilities are operated in different recovery modes. In the event that MPLX has derivative positions in excess of the product delivered or expected to be delivered, the excess derivative positions may be terminated.\nMPLX management conducts a standard credit review on counterparties to derivative contracts, and it has provided the counterparties with a guaranty as credit support for its obligations. MPLX uses standardized agreements that allow for offset of certain positive and negative exposures in the event of default or other terminating events, including bankruptcy.\nOpen Derivative Positions and Sensitivity Analysis\nThe following table includes the composition of net losses/gains on our commodity derivative positions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 21 for additional information on our open derivative positions at December 31, 2020.\nSensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of December 31, 2020 is provided in the following table.\nWe remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity. Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.\nWe evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after December 31, 2020 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur use of fixed or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates or that our current fixed rate debt may be higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for additional information on our debt.\n87\nSensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding finance leases, as of December 31, 2020 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.\n(a)\nFair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.\n(b)\nAssumes a 100-basis point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at December 31, 2020.\n(c)\nAssumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change in net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20 for additional information on the fair value of our debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to some of our purchases of crude oil denominated in Canadian dollars. We did not utilize derivatives to hedge our market risk exposure to these foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2020.\nCounterparty Risk\nWe are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment by our customers to whom we provide services, lease assets, or sell natural gas or NGLs. We believe that certain contracts would allow us to pass those losses through to our customers, thus reducing our risk, when we are selling NGLs and acting as our producer customers’ agent. Our credit exposure related to these customers is represented by the value of our trade receivables or lease receivables. Where exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customer’s financial condition prior to entering into a transaction or agreement, establish credit terms and monitor the appropriateness of these terms on an ongoing basis. In the event of a customer default, we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative contracts. Our credit exposure related to commodity derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date. Outstanding instruments expose us to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. Should the creditworthiness of one or more of our counterparties decline, our ability to mitigate nonperformance risk is limited to a counterparty agreeing to either a voluntary termination and subsequent cash settlement or a novation of the derivative contract to a third party. In the event of a counterparty default, we may sustain a loss and our cash receipts could be negatively impacted.\n88"

They necessarily include some amounts that are based on best judgments and estimates. The financial information displayed in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with these consolidated financial statements.\nMPC seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its financial records by careful selection of its managers, by organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and by communications programs aimed at assuring that its policies and methods are understood throughout the organization.\nThe board of directors pursues its oversight role in the area of financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting through its Audit Committee. This committee, composed solely of independent directors, regularly meets (jointly and separately) with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and internal auditors to monitor the proper discharge by each of their responsibilities relative to internal accounting controls and the consolidated financial statements.\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nMPC’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). An evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework in\nInternal Control\n–\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based on the results of this evaluation, MPC’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of MPC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\n90\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Marathon Petroleum Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Marathon Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n91\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nLong-Lived Asset Recoverability Tests – Refinery Asset Groups\nAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements and as disclosed by management, the Company’s consolidated long-lived asset balance was $43 billion as of December 31, 2020, which includes the refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment. Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is determined, and the carrying value is written down to the determined fair value. During the first and second quarters of 2020, management identified long-lived asset triggers relating to all of their refinery asset groups, except the Gallup refinery in the second quarter as it had been impaired to its estimated salvage value in the first quarter, as a result of decreases to the Refining & Marketing segment expected future cash flows. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and commodity price declines in the first quarter and continued unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in the second quarter. Management performed recoverability tests for each refinery asset group by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of each asset group. The determination of undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for the first and second quarter refinery asset group recoverability tests utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows, allocation of Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to the individual refinery asset groups, the estimated useful life of certain refinery asset groups, and the estimated salvage value of certain refinery asset groups.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the long-lived asset recoverability tests of the refinery asset groups performed by management in the first and second quarters of 2020 is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows of the refinery asset groups; and (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s recoverability tests and the significant assumption related to allocation of Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to individual refinery asset groups.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s long-lived asset recoverability tests, including controls over the allocation of the undiscounted estimates of pretax cash flows to individual refinery asset groups.\n92\nThese procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows utilized for the recoverability tests; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flow model used; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in the model; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption related to the allocation of Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to individual refineries. Evaluating the reasonableness of this significant assumption involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s allocation of Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to individual refinery asset groups; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness, completeness, and accuracy of underlying data used to allocate Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to individual refinery asset groups; and (iii) considering whether the data used in the allocation was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s undiscounted estimated pretax cash flow model.\nGoodwill Impairment Tests – Certain Midstream Reporting Units\nAs described in Notes 7 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements and as disclosed by management, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $8,256 million as of December 31, 2020, which includes, within the Midstream segment, the goodwill associated with MPLX’s Crude Gathering reporting unit of $1.1 billion. As described by management, within the Midstream segment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.81 billion in the first quarter of 2020 related to MPLX’s Eastern Gathering & Processing reporting unit, which fully impaired the reporting unit’s historical goodwill balance. Management annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as of November 30, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying amount. The overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which MPLX and its customers operate, as well as a sustained decrease in the MPLX unit price, were considered triggering events requiring an impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. The fair values of the reporting units were determined based on applying both a discounted cash flow method, or income approach, as well as a market approach. Significant assumptions that were used to estimate the MPLX Eastern Gathering and Processing and MPLX Crude Gathering reporting units’ fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management’s best estimates of the discount rate, as well as estimates of future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by producer customers’ development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment tests of the Company’s Crude Gathering and Eastern Gathering and Processing reporting units of the Midstream segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the reporting units; and (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumption related to future volumes.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment tests, including controls over the estimation of the fair value of the Crude Gathering and Eastern Gathering and Processing reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches used; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in the approaches; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption related to future volumes. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were utilized to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s income and market approaches. Evaluating the assumption related to future volumes involved (i) considering whether the assumption used was reasonable considering past performance of each reporting unit, producer customers’ historical and future production volumes, and industry outlook reports; and (ii) considering whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nEquity Method Investment Impairment Test - MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C.\nAs described in Notes 7 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated equity method investment balance was $5,422 million as of December 31, 2020, which included a balance of $698 million related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.25 billion related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. As disclosed by management, equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary\n93\nloss in value. As a result of the overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which MPLX and its customers operate, there was a reduction in forecasted volumes processed by the systems operated by MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. These were considered events requiring an impairment test during the first quarter of 2020. The fair value of the investment was determined based on applying a discounted cash flow method, an income approach. Significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment test of the Company’s equity method investment in MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when estimating the fair value of the investment; and (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumption related to future volumes.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s equity method investment impairment test, including controls over the estimation of the fair value of the investment in MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method used; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in the method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption related to future volumes. Evaluating the assumption related to future volumes involved (i) considering whether the assumption used was reasonable considering past performance of MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C., producer customers’ historical and future production volumes, and industry outlook reports; and (ii) considering whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nToledo, Ohio\nFebruary 26, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2010.\n94\nMARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(a)\n2020 includes impairment expense.

We operate the nation's largest refining system. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market and to independent entrepreneurs who operate approximately\n7,100\nbranded outlets. We also sell transportation fuel to consumers through approximately\n1,090\ndirect dealer locations under long-term supply contracts. MPC’s midstream operations are primarily conducted through MPLX LP (“MPLX”), which owns and operates crude oil and light product transportation and logistics infrastructure as well as gathering, processing, and fractionation assets. We own the general partner and a majority limited partner interest in MPLX.\nOn August 2, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven, Inc. (“7-Eleven”) for $\n21\nbillion in cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. We will retain our direct dealer business.\nAs a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, its results are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and its assets and liabilities have been presented in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale. In addition, we separately disclosed the operating and investing cash flows of Speedway as discontinued operations within our consolidated statements of cash flow. See Note 5 for discontinued operations disclosures.\nPrior to presentation of Speedway as discontinued operations, Speedway and our retained direct dealer business were the two reporting units within our Retail segment. Beginning with the third quarter of 2020, the direct dealer business is managed as part of the Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Refining & Marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented. See Note 13 for our segment reporting disclosures.\nRefer to Note 8 for further information on the Andeavor acquisition, which closed on October 1, 2018, and to Notes 6 and 13 for additional information about our operations.\nBasis of Presentation\nAll significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.\nAs a result of our agreement to sell Speedway, the following changes in our basis of presentation have occurred:\n•\nIn accordance with ASC 205, Discontinued Operations, intersegment sales from our Refining & Marketing segment to Speedway are no longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue, since we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway subsequent to the sale to 7-Eleven. All periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change.\n•\nBeginning August 2, 2020, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway’s property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use lease assets.\nCertain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n101\n2.\nSUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples Applied in Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and MPLX. As of December 31, 2020, we owned the general partner and\n62\npercent of the outstanding MPLX common units. Due to our ownership of the general partner interest, we have determined that we control MPLX and therefore we consolidate MPLX and record a noncontrolling interest for the interest owned by the public. Changes in ownership interest in consolidated subsidiaries that do not result in a change in control are recorded as equity transactions.\nInvestments in entities over which we have significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. This includes entities in which we hold majority ownership but the minority shareholders have substantive participating rights. Income from equity method investments represents our proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method investees.\nDifferences in the basis of the investments and the separate net asset values of the investees, if any, are amortized into net income over the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets and liabilities, except for any excess related to goodwill. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate an other than temporary loss in value has occurred. When the loss is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue based on consideration specified in contracts or agreements with customers when we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control over products or services to a customer. Concurrent with our adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), as of January 1, 2018, we made an accounting policy election that all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a revenue-producing transaction and collected from our customers will be recognized on a net basis within sales and other operating revenues.\nOur revenue recognition patterns are described below by reportable segment:\n•\nRefining & Marketing - The vast majority of our Refining & Marketing contracts contain pricing that is based on the market price for the product at the time of delivery. Our obligations to deliver product volumes are typically satisfied and revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to our customers. Concurrent with the transfer of control, we typically receive the right to payment for the delivered product, the customer accepts the product and the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment terms require customers to pay shortly after delivery and do not contain significant financing components.\n•\nMidstream - Midstream revenue transactions typically are defined by contracts under which we sell a product or provide a service. Revenues from sales of product are recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer. Revenues from sales of services are recognized over time when the performance obligation is satisfied as services are provided in a series. We have elected to use the output measure of progress to recognize revenue based on the units delivered, processed or transported. The transaction prices in our Midstream contracts often have both fixed components, related to minimum volume commitments, and variable components, which are primarily dependent on volumes. Variable consideration will generally not be estimated at contract inception as the transaction price is specifically allocable to the services provided at each period end.\nRefer to Note 23 for disclosure of our revenue disaggregated by segment and product line and to Note 13 for a description of our reportable segment operations.\n102\nCrude Oil and Refined Product Exchanges and Matching Buy/Sell Transactions\nWe enter into exchange contracts and matching buy/sell arrangements whereby we agree to deliver a particular quantity and quality of crude oil or refined products at a specified location and date to a particular counterparty and to receive from the same counterparty the same commodity at a specified location on the same or another specified date. The exchange receipts and deliveries are nonmonetary transactions, with the exception of associated grade or location differentials that are settled in cash. The matching buy/sell purchase and sale transactions are settled in cash. No revenues are recorded for exchange and matching buy/sell transactions as they are accounted for as exchanges of inventory. The exchange transactions are recognized at the carrying amount of the inventory transferred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash and investments that must be maintained as collateral for letters of credit issued to certain third-party producer customers. The balances will be outstanding until certain capital projects are completed and the third party releases the restriction.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nOur receivables primarily consist of customer accounts receivable. Customer receivables are recorded at the invoiced amounts and generally do not bear interest. Allowances for doubtful accounts are generally recorded when it becomes probable the receivable will not be collected and are booked to bad debt expense. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in customer accounts receivable. We review the allowance quarterly and past-due balances over\n180\ndays are reviewed individually for collectability.\nWe mitigate credit risk with master netting agreements with companies engaged in the crude oil or refinery feedstock trading and supply business or the petroleum refining industry. A master netting agreement generally provides for a once per month net cash settlement of the accounts receivable from and the accounts payable to a particular counterparty.\nLeases\nContracts with a term greater than one year that convey the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit of an asset are accounted for as right of use assets.\nRight of use asset and lease liability balances are recorded at the commencement date at present value of the fixed lease payments using a secured incremental borrowing rate with a maturity similar to the lease term because our leases do not provide implicit rates. We have elected to include both lease and non-lease components in the present value of the lease payments for all lessee asset classes with the exception of our marine and third-party contractor service equipment leases. The lease component of the payment for the marine and equipment asset classes is determined using a relative standalone selling price. See Note 28 for additional disclosures about our lease contracts.\nInventories\nInventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventories is determined primarily under the LIFO method. Costs for crude oil and refined product inventories are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market value.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use derivatives to economically hedge a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk and, historically, to interest rate risk. Our use of selective derivative instruments that assume market risk is limited. All derivative instruments (including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recorded at fair value. Certain commodity derivatives are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets on a net basis by counterparty as they are governed by master netting agreements. Cash flows related to derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk and interest rate risk are classified in operating activities with the underlying transactions.\n103\nDerivatives not designated as accounting hedges\nDerivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges may include commodity derivatives used to hedge price risk on (1) inventories, (2) fixed price sales of refined products, (3) the acquisition of foreign-sourced crude oil, (4) the acquisition of ethanol for blending with refined products, (5) the sale of NGLs, (6) the purchase of natural gas and (7) the purchase of soybean oil. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are recognized immediately in net income.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nAll of our financial instruments, including derivatives, involve elements of credit and market risk. The most significant portion of our credit risk relates to nonperformance by counterparties. The counterparties to our financial instruments consist primarily of major financial institutions and companies within the energy industry. To manage counterparty risk associated with financial instruments, we select and monitor counterparties based on an assessment of their financial strength and on credit ratings, if available. Additionally, we limit the level of exposure with any single counterparty.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\none year\nto\n61\nyears. Such assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment assessment is performed and the excess of the book value over the fair value of the asset group is recorded as an impairment loss.\nWhen items of property, plant and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, any gains or losses are reported in net income. Gains on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are recognized when earned, which is generally at the time of closing. If a loss on disposal is expected, such losses are recognized when the assets are classified as held for sale.\nInterest expense is capitalized for qualifying assets under construction. Capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below carrying value. If we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, no further impairment testing is required. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if that assessment indicates that further impairment testing is required, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using an income and/or market approach which is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The fair value under the income approach is calculated using the expected present value of future cash flows method. Significant assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts include future net operating margins, future volumes, discount rates, and future capital requirements.\nAmortization of intangibles with definite lives is calculated using the straight-line method, which is reflective of the benefit pattern in which the estimated economic benefit is expected to be received over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset. Intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset. Intangibles not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment is recorded for the difference.\n104\nMajor Maintenance Activities\nCosts for planned turnaround and other major maintenance activities are expensed in the period incurred. These types of costs include contractor repair services, materials and supplies, equipment rentals and our labor costs.\nEnvironmental Costs\nEnvironmental expenditures for additional equipment that mitigates or prevents future contamination or improves environmental safety or efficiency of the existing assets are capitalized. We recognize remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of remediation accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the commitment to a formal plan of action. Remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposure and are discounted when the estimated amounts are reasonably fixed and determinable. If recoveries of remediation costs from third parties are probable, a receivable is recorded and is discounted when the estimated amount is reasonably fixed and determinable.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe fair value of asset retirement obligations is recognized in the period in which the obligations are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The majority of our recognized asset retirement liability relates to conditional asset retirement obligations for removal and disposal of fire-retardant material from certain refining facilities. The remaining recognized asset retirement liability relates to other refining assets, certain pipelines and processing facilities and other related pipeline assets. The fair values recorded for such obligations are based on the most probable current cost projections.\nAsset retirement obligations have not been recognized for some assets because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement dates of the obligations are indeterminate. Such obligations will be recognized in the period when sufficient information becomes available to estimate a range of potential settlement dates. The asset retirement obligations principally include the hazardous material disposal and removal or dismantlement requirements associated with the closure of certain refining, terminal, pipeline and processing assets.\nOur practice is to keep our assets in good operating condition through routine repair and maintenance of component parts in the ordinary course of business and by continuing to make improvements based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that generally these assets have no expected settlement date for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations since the dates or ranges of dates upon which we would retire these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recorded when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on several factors, primarily our expectation to generate sufficient future taxable income.\nStock-Based Compensation Arrangements\nThe fair value of stock options granted to our employees is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The model employs various assumptions based on management’s estimates at the time of grant, which impact the calculation of fair value and ultimately, the amount of expense that is recognized over the vesting period of the stock option award. Of the required assumptions, the expected life of the stock option award and the expected volatility of our stock price have the most significant impact on the fair value calculation. The average expected life is based on our historical employee exercise behavior. The assumption for expected volatility of our stock price reflects a weighting of\n50\npercent of our common stock implied volatility and\n50\npercent of our common stock historical volatility.\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards granted to our employees is determined based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of performance unit awards granted to our employees is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\n105\nOur stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on management’s estimate of the awards that are expected to vest, using the straight-line attribution method for all service-based awards with a graded vesting feature. If actual forfeiture results are different than expected, adjustments to recognized compensation expense may be required in future periods. Unearned stock-based compensation is charged to equity when restricted stock awards are granted. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period and is adjusted if conditions of the restricted stock award are not met.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe recognize and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess or surplus of the purchase consideration when compared to the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase. For material acquisitions, management engages an independent valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest, if any, and goodwill, based on recognized business valuation methodologies. An income, market or cost valuation method may be utilized to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest, if any, in a business combination. The income valuation method represents the present value of future cash flows over the life of the asset using: (i) discrete financial forecasts, which rely on management’s estimates of revenue and operating expenses; (ii) long-term growth rates; and (iii) appropriate discount rates. The market valuation method uses prices paid for a reasonably similar asset by other purchasers in the market, with adjustments relating to any differences between the assets. The cost valuation method is based on the replacement cost of a comparable asset at prices at the time of the acquisition reduced for depreciation of the asset. If the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurs, an estimate will be recorded. Subsequent to the acquisition date, and not later than one year from the acquisition date, we will record any material adjustments to the initial estimate based on new information obtained that would have existed as of the date of the acquisition. Any adjustment that arises from information obtained that did not exist as of the date of the acquisition will be recorded in the period of the adjustment. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred in connection with each business combination.\nEnvironmental Credits and Obligations\nIn order to comply with certain regulations, specifically the RFS2 requirements implemented by the EPA and the cap-and-trade emission reduction program and low carbon fuel standard implemented by the state of California, we are required to reduce our emissions, blend certain levels of biofuels or obtain allowances or credits to offset the obligations created by our operations. In regard to each program, we record an asset, included in other current or other noncurrent assets on the balance sheet, for allowances or credits owned in excess of our anticipated current period compliance requirements. The asset value is based on the product of the excess allowances or credits as of the balance sheet date, if any, and the weighted average cost of those allowances or credits. We record a liability, included in other current or other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet, when we are deficient allowances or credits based on the product of the deficient amount as of the balance sheet date, if any, and the market price of the allowances or credits at the balance sheet date. The cost of allowances or credits used for compliance is reflected in cost of revenues on the income statement.\nAny gains or losses on the sale or expiration of allowances or credits are classified as other income on the income statement. Proceeds from the sale of allowances or credits are reported in investing activities - all other, net on the cash flow statement.\n3.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRecently Adopted\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” using the modified retrospective transition method. The amendment requires entities to consider a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses, which may result in earlier recognition of losses. The ASU requires the company to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments, including trade receivables, and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n106\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our sales of refined petroleum products, crude oil and midstream services. We assess each customer’s ability to pay through our credit review process. The credit review process considers various factors such as external credit ratings, a review of financial statements to determine liquidity, leverage, trends and business specific risks, market information, pay history and our business strategy. Customers that do not qualify for payment terms are required to prepay or provide a letter of credit. We monitor our ongoing credit exposure through timely review of customer payment activity. At December 31, 2020, we reported $\n5,760\nmillion of accounts and notes receivable, net of allowances of $\n18\nmillion.\nWe are also exposed to credit losses from off-balance sheet exposures, such as guarantees of joint venture debt. See Note 29 for more information on these off-balance sheet exposures.\nWe also adopted the following ASUs during 2020, none of which had a material impact to our financial statements or financial statement disclosures:\nNot Yet Adopted\nASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. Amendments include removal of certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740 and simplification in several other areas such as accounting for a franchise tax or similar tax that is partially based on income. The change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We do not expect the application of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n4.\nRESTRUCTURING\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we indefinitely idled our refinery located in Gallup, New Mexico and initiated actions to strategically reposition our Martinez, California refinery to a renewable diesel facility. We also approved an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $\n367\nmillion in 2020.\nThe indefinite idling of the Gallup refinery and actions to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility resulted in $\n195\nmillion of restructuring expenses. Of the $\n195\nmillion of restructuring expenses, we expect $\n130\nmillion to settle in cash for costs related to decommissioning refinery processing units and storage tanks and fulfilling environmental remediation obligations. Additionally, we recorded a non-cash reserve against our materials and supplies inventory at these facilities of $\n51\nmillion.\nThe involuntary workforce reduction plan, together with employee reductions resulting from our actions affecting the Gallup and Martinez refineries, affected approximately\n2,050\nemployees. We recorded $\n172\nmillion of restructuring expenses for separation benefits payable under our employee separation plan and certain collective bargaining agreements that we expect to settle in cash. Certain of the affected MPC employees provided services to MPLX. MPLX has various employee services agreements and secondment agreements with MPC pursuant to which MPLX reimburses MPC for employee costs, along with the provision of operational and management services in support of MPLX’s operations. Pursuant to such agreements, MPC was reimbursed by MPLX for $\n37\nmillion of the $\n172\nmillion of restructuring expenses recorded for these actions.\nRestructuring expenses were accrued as restructuring reserves within accounts payable, payroll and benefits payable, other current liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets. We expect cash payments for the majority of these reserves to occur within the next nine months.\n107\n(a)\nThe restructuring reserve was zero until the third quarter of 2020.\n5.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\nOn August 2, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven for $\n21\nbillion, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. The taxable transaction is targeted to close in the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals.\nAs a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, its results are reported separately as discontinued operations, net of tax, in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and its assets and liabilities have been presented in our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale. Additionally, beginning August 2, 2020, in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we ceased recording depreciation and amortization for Speedway’s property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use lease assets. In addition, we separately disclosed the operating and investing cash flows of Speedway as discontinued operations within our consolidated statements of cash flow.\nThe following tables present Speedway results as reported in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, within our consolidated statements of income and the carrying value of assets and liabilities as presented within assets and liabilities held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets.\n108\nSeparation Agreements\nIn connection with the definitive agreement to sell Speedway, we have agreed to enter into a 15-year fuel supply agreement, at closing, through which we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway subsequent to the sale to 7-Eleven. Due to our expected continuing involvement with Speedway through a fuel supply agreement, intersegment sales from our Refining & Marketing segment to Speedway are no longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue.\nPurchase of Speedway’s Interest in PFJ Southeast\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, Pilot Travel Centers LLC exercised an option to purchase our\n29\npercent interest in PFJ Southeast LLC (“PFJ”), subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals. PFJ has been accounted for as an asset held for sale as of September 30, 2020 and is reported as the equity method investment balance in the above table.\n6.\nMASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\nWe own the general partner and a majority limited partner interest in MPLX, which owns and operates crude oil and light product transportation and logistics infrastructure as well as gathering, processing, and fractionation assets. We control MPLX through our ownership of the general partner interest and, as of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately\n62\npercent of the outstanding MPLX common units.\nJavelina Assets Held-for-Sale\nOn December 23, 2020, MPLX entered into an agreement with a third party to sell all of its equity interests in MarkWest Javelina Company, L.L.C., MarkWest Javelina Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and MarkWest Gas Services, L.L.C. (collectively, “Javelina”). Javelina’s assets and liabilities have been presented within our consolidated balance sheets as assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2020. On February 12, 2021, MPLX completed the sale of Javelina.\n109\nUnit Repurchase Program\nOn November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the board authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $\n1\nbillion of MPLX’s outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020,\n1,473,843\ncommon units had been repurchased at an average cost per unit of $\n22.29\n. Total cash paid for units repurchased during the year was $\n33\nmillion and $\n967\nmillion remained outstanding on the program for future repurchases as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX had agreements to acquire\n99,406\nadditional common units for $\n2\nmillion, which settled in early January 2021.\nRedemption of Business from MPLX\nOn July 31, 2020, Western Refining Southwest, Inc. (now known as Western Refining Southwest LLC) (“WRSW”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPC, entered into a Redemption Agreement (the “Redemption Agreement”) with MPLX, pursuant to which MPLX transferred to WRSW all of the outstanding membership interests in Western Refining Wholesale, LLC, (“WRW”) in exchange for the redemption of MPLX common units held by WRSW. The transaction effects the transfer to MPC of the Western wholesale distribution business that MPLX acquired as a result of its acquisition of Andeavor Logistics LP (“ANDX”). Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, the results of these operations are presented in MPC’s Refining & Marketing segment.\nAt the closing, per the terms of Redemption Agreement, MPLX redeemed\n18,582,088\nMPLX common units (the “Redeemed Units”) held by WRSW. The number of Redeemed Units was calculated by dividing WRW’s aggregate valuation of $\n340\nmillion by the simple average of the volume weighted average NYSE prices of an MPLX common unit for the ten trading days ending at market close on July 27, 2020. The transaction resulted in a minor decrease in MPC’s ownership interest in MPLX.\nMPLX’s Acquisition of ANDX\nOn July 30, 2019, MPLX completed its acquisition of ANDX, and ANDX survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of MPLX. At the effective time of the ANDX acquisition, each common unit held by ANDX’s public unitholders was converted into the right to receive\n1.135\nMPLX common units. ANDX common units held by MPC were converted into the right to receive\n1.0328\nMPLX common units. Additionally, as a result of MPLX’s acquisition of MPLX,\n600,000\nANDX preferred units were converted into\n600,000\npreferred units of MPLX (“Series B preferred units”). Series B preferred unitholders are entitled to receive, when and if declared by the board of directors of MPLX’s general partner, a fixed distribution of $\n68.75\nper unit, per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, or the first business day thereafter, up to and including February 15, 2023. After February 15, 2023, the holders of Series B preferred units are entitled to receive cumulative, quarterly distributions payable in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year, or the first business day thereafter, based on a floating annual rate equal to the three month LIBOR plus 4.652 percent.\nMPC accounted for this transaction as a common control transaction, as defined by ASC 805, which resulted in an increase to noncontrolling interest and a decrease to additional paid-in capital of approximately $\n55\nmillion, net of tax. During the third quarter of 2019, we pushed down to MPLX the portion of the goodwill attributable to ANDX as of October 1, 2018, the date of our acquisition of Andeavor. Due to this push down of goodwill, we also recorded an incremental $\n642\nmillion deferred tax liability associated with the portion of the non-deductible goodwill attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MPLX with an offsetting reduction of our additional paid-in capital balance. We have consolidated ANDX since we acquired Andeavor on October 1, 2018 in accordance with ASC 810.\n110\nDropdowns to MPLX and GP/IDR Exchange\nOn February 1, 2018, we contributed our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX in exchange for $\n4.1\nbillion in cash and approximately\n112\nmillion common units and\n2\nmillion general partner units from MPLX. MPLX financed the cash portion of the transaction with a $\n4.1\nbillion\n364\n-day term loan facility, which was entered into on January 2, 2018. We agreed to waive approximately one-third of the first quarter 2018 distributions on the common units issued in connection with this transaction. The contributions of these assets were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss.\nImmediately following the February 1, 2018 dropdown to MPLX, our IDRs were cancelled and our economic general partner interest was converted into a non-economic general partner interest, all in exchange for\n275\nmillion newly issued MPLX common units (“GP/IDR Exchange”). As a result of this transaction, the general partner units and IDRs were eliminated, are no longer outstanding and no longer participate in distributions of cash from MPLX.\nAgreements\nWe have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX. Under these agreements, MPLX provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to us. With certain exceptions, these agreements generally contain minimum volume commitments. These transactions are eliminated in consolidation but are reflected as intersegment transactions between our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments. We also have agreements with MPLX that establish fees for operational and management services provided between us and MPLX and for executive management services and certain general and administrative services provided by us to MPLX. These transactions are eliminated in consolidation but are reflected as intersegment transactions between our Corporate and Midstream segments.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nAs a result of equity transactions of MPLX and ANDX, we are required to adjust non-controlling interest and additional paid-in capital. Changes in MPC’s additional paid-in capital resulting from changes in its ownership interest in MPLX and ANDX were as follows:\n7.\nIMPAIRMENTS\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 have resulted in significant economic disruption globally. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. These actions have, in turn significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in a decrease in motor vehicle usage and demand for gasoline and a dramatic reduction in airline flights. These macroeconomic conditions and certain global geopolitical events in the first quarter of 2020 contributed to a significant decline in crude oil prices as well as an increase in crude oil price volatility. The decrease in demand for refined petroleum products has resulted in a significant decrease in the price and volume of the refined petroleum products we produce and sell as compared to 2019.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which we operate, the related changes to our expected future cash flows, as well as a sustained decrease in share price were considered triggering events requiring the performance of various tests of the carrying values of our assets. Triggering events requiring the performance of various tests of the carrying value of our Midstream\n111\nassets were also identified by MPLX as a result of the overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which MPLX and its customers operate, which led to a reduction in forecasted volumes processed by the systems operated by MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C., MPLX’s equity method investee, as well as a sustained decrease in the MPLX unit price. These tests resulted in the majority of the impairment charges in 2020, as discussed below.\nThe table below provides information related to the impairments recognized during 2020 and 2019, along with the location of these impairments within the consolidated statements of income.\n(a)\nThe remaining difference not described in the narrative below is related to certain immaterial Midstream assets.\nGoodwill\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $\n7.33\nbillion. See Note 19 for detail by segment. The goodwill impairment within the Refining & Marketing segment was primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices. The impairment within the Midstream segment was primarily driven by additional information related to the slowing of drilling activity, which has reduced production growth forecasts from MPLX’s producer customers.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $\n64\nmillion. The $\n64\nmillion of goodwill was transferred from our Midstream segment to our Refining & Marketing segment during the third quarter of 2020 in connection with the transfer to MPC of the MPLX wholesale distribution business as described in Note 6. The transfer required goodwill impairment tests for the transferor and transferee reporting units. Our Refining & Marketing reporting unit that recorded the $\n64\nmillion impairment expense has no remaining goodwill.\nThe fair values of the reporting units for the first quarter of 2020 goodwill impairment analysis were determined based on applying both a discounted cash flow method, or income approach, as well as a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management’s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates, which range from\n9.0\npercent to\n13.5\npercent across all reporting units. Significant assumptions that were used to estimate the MPLX Eastern Gathering and Processing and MPLX Crude Gathering reporting units’ fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management’s best estimates of the discount rate, as well as estimates of future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by producer customer’s development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the individual reporting units’ overall fair values represent Level 3 measurements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an impairment of goodwill in our Midstream segment. As a result of the merger of MPLX and ANDX in 2019 and subsequent changes to MPLX’s internal organization structure, the number of reporting units within our Midstream segment was reduced from 16 to 7 in conjunction with the annual impairment test, however, this change in structure did not have any impact on MPC’s operating segments. Reporting units are determined based on the way in which segment management operates and reviews each operating segment. MPLX performed a goodwill impairment assessment prior to the change in reporting units in addition to performing an impairment assessment immediately following the change in their reporting units. Significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value include the discount rate as well as estimates of future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by producer customers’ development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements. After MPLX performed its evaluations related to the impairment of goodwill, we recorded an impairment of $\n1,156\nmillion prior to the change in reporting units and additional impairment of $\n41\nmillion subsequent to the change in reporting units. The remainder of the reporting units fair values were in\n112\nexcess of their carrying values. The impairment was primarily driven by the updated guidance related to the slowing of drilling activity which has reduced production growth forecasts from MPLX’s producer customers.\nThe fair value of the reporting units for the fourth quarter of 2019 goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on applying both a discounted cash flow or income approach as well as a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management’s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates, which range from\n9.0\npercent to\n10.0\npercent. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the individual reporting units’ overall fair values, and the fair values of the goodwill assigned thereto, represent Level 3 measurements.\nEquity Method Investments\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we recorded equity method investment impairment charges totaling $\n1.315\nbillion, of which $\n1.25\nbillion related to MarkWest Utica EMG, L.L.C. and its investment in Ohio Gathering Company, L.L.C. The impairments were largely due to a reduction in forecasted volumes gathered and processed by the systems operated by the equity method investments. The fair value of the investments were determined based upon applying a discounted cash flow method, an income approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value of these equity method investments represents a Level 3 measurement.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, two joint ventures in which MPLX has an interest recorded impairments, which impacted the amount of income from equity method investments during the period by approximately $\n28\nmillion. For one of the joint ventures, MPLX also had a basis difference which was being amortized over the life of the underlying assets. As a result of the impairment recorded by the joint venture, MPLX also assessed this basis difference for impairment and recorded approximately $\n14\nmillion of impairment expense during the fourth quarter related to this investment.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets (primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets other than goodwill, and right of use assets) used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets and the plant level or pipeline system level for Midstream segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is determined, and the carrying value is written down to the determined fair value.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment as a result of decreases to the Refining & Marketing segment expected future cash flows. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and commodity price declines. We performed recoverability tests for each refinery asset group by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of each asset group. Only the Gallup refinery’s carrying value exceeded its undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows. It was determined that the fair value of the Gallup refinery’s property, plant and equipment was less than the carrying value. As a result, we recorded a charge of $\n142\nmillion in the first quarter of 2020 to impairment expense on the consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurements for the Gallup refinery assets represent Level 3 measurements.\n113\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we identified long-lived asset impairment triggers relating to all of our refinery asset groups within the Refining & Marketing segment, except the Gallup refinery as it had been impaired to its estimated salvage value in the first quarter, as a result of continued unfavorable macroeconomic conditions impacting the Refining & Marketing segment expected future cash flows. We performed recoverability tests for each refinery asset group by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of each asset group. All of these refinery asset groups’ undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded their carrying value by at least\n17\npercent.\nThe determination of undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows for the first and second quarter refinery asset group recoverability tests utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows, allocation of certain Refining & Marketing segment cash flows to the individual refinery asset groups, the estimated useful life of certain refinery asset groups, and the estimated salvage value of certain refinery asset groups.\nOn August 3, 2020, we announced our plans to evaluate possibilities to strategically reposition our Martinez refinery, including the potential conversion of the refinery into a renewable diesel facility. Subsequent to August 3, 2020, we progressed activities associated with the conversion of the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility, including applying for permits, advancing discussions with feedstock suppliers, and beginning detailed engineering activities. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with a potential to build to full capacity of approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. As a result of the progression of these activities, we identified assets that would be repurposed and utilized in a renewable diesel facility configuration and assets that would be abandoned since they had no function in a renewable diesel facility configuration. This change in our intended use for the Martinez refinery is a long-lived asset impairment trigger for the assets that would be repurposed and remain as part of the Martinez asset group. We assessed the asset group for impairment by comparing the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows exceeded the Martinez asset group carrying value. We recorded impairment expense of $\n342\nmillion for the abandoned assets as we are no longer using these assets and have no expectation to use these assets in the future. Additionally, as a result of our efforts to progress the conversion of Martinez refinery into a renewable diesel facility, MPLX cancelled in-process capital projects related to its Martinez refinery logistics operations resulting in impairments of $\n27\nmillion in the third quarter of 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded the evaluation of our intended use of MPLX terminal assets near the Gallup refinery and determined that the assets were abandoned, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n67\nmillion. Following this conclusion, we revised the estimate of the salvage value for the Gallup refinery asset group resulting in an additional $\n44\nmillion impairment charge. These charges are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income.\nThe determinations of expected future cash flows and the salvage values of refineries, as described earlier, require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Should our assumptions significantly change in future periods, it is possible we may determine the carrying values of certain of our refinery asset groups exceed the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows of their refinery asset groups, which would result in future impairment charges.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we identified an impairment trigger relating to asset groups within MPLX’s Western Gathering and Processing (“G&P”) reporting unit as a result of significant changes to expected future cash flows for these asset groups resulting from the effects of COVID-19. The cash flows associated with these assets were significantly impacted by volume declines reflecting decreased forecasted producer customer production as a result of lower commodity prices. We assessed each asset group within the Western G&P reporting unit for impairment. It was determined that the fair value of the East Texas G&P asset group’s underlying assets were less than the carrying value. As a result, MPLX recorded impairment charges totaling $\n350\nmillion related to its property, plant and equipment and intangibles, which are included in impairment expense on our consolidated statements of income. Fair value of property, plant and equipment was determined using a combination of an income and cost approach. The income approach utilized significant assumptions including management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows and the estimated useful life of the asset group. The cost approach utilized assumptions for the current replacement costs of similar assets adjusted for estimated depreciation and deterioration of the existing equipment and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based\n114\non applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions included management’s best estimates of the expected future cash flows from existing customers, customer attrition rates and the discount rate. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment analysis will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. The fair value measurements for the asset group fair values represent Level 3 measurements.\n8.\nACQUISITIONS\nAcquisition of Andeavor\nOn October 1, 2018, we acquired Andeavor. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Andeavor stockholders had the option to choose\n1.87\nshares of MPC common stock or $\n152.27\nin cash per share of Andeavor common stock. The merger agreement included election proration provisions that resulted in approximately\n22.9\nmillion shares of Andeavor common stock being converted into cash consideration and the remaining\n128.2\nmillion shares of Andeavor common stock being converted into stock consideration. Andeavor stockholders received in the aggregate approximately\n239.8\nmillion shares of MPC common stock and approximately $\n3.5\nbillion in cash in connection with the Andeavor acquisition. The fair value of the MPC shares issued was determined on the basis of the closing market price of MPC’s common shares on the acquisition date. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded using cash on hand.\nAt the time of the acquisition, all Andeavor equity awards, with the exception of non-employee director units, were converted to MPC equity awards. The converted equity awards continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Andeavor equity awards immediately prior to the acquisition. We recognized $\n203\nmillion of purchase consideration to reflect the portion of the fair value of the time-based converted equity awards attributable to pre-combination service completed by the award holders. The non-employee director units were accelerated in full and cancelled and the holders of such units received an amount of cash equal to the number of shares of Andeavor common stock subject to such non-employee director units multiplied by the cash consideration per share.\nOur financial results reflect the results of Andeavor from October 1, 2018, the date of the acquisition.\nThe components of the fair value of consideration transferred are as follows:\nThe purchase consideration allocation resulted in the recognition of $\n17.3\nbillion in goodwill, of which $\n1.0\nbillion is tax deductible due to a carryover basis from Andeavor. Our Refining & Marketing, Midstream and former Retail segment recognized $\n5.2\nbillion, $\n8.1\nbillion and $\n3.9\nbillion of goodwill, respectively. The recognized goodwill represents the value expected to be created by further optimization of crude supply, a nationwide retail and marketing platform, diversification of our refining and midstream footprints and optimization of information systems and business processes. See Note 7 for information regarding impairments recorded in 2020 and 2019.\nWe recognized $\n47\nmillion in acquisition costs. Additionally, we recognized various other transaction-related costs, including employee-related costs associated with the Andeavor acquisition. All of these costs are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. The employee-related costs are primarily due to pre-existing Andeavor change in control and equity award agreements that create obligations and accelerated equity vesting upon MPC notifying employees of significant changes to or elimination of their responsibilities.\nAndeavor’s results have been included in MPC’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the date of the acquisition on October 1, 2018. Andeavor contributed revenues of approximately $\n11.3\nbillion including Speedway for the period from October 1 through December 31, 2018. We do not believe it is\n115\npractical to disclose Andeavor’s contribution to earnings for the period from October 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 as our integration efforts have resulted in the elimination of Andeavor stand-alone discrete financial information due mainly to our inclusion of Andeavor inventory in our consolidated LIFO inventory pools, which does not allow us to objectively distinguish the cost of sales between the two historical reporting entities.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents consolidated results assuming the Andeavor acquisition occurred on January 1, 2017.\nThe pro forma information includes adjustments to align accounting policies, an adjustment to depreciation expense to reflect the increased fair value of property, plant and equipment, increased amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets and the related income tax effects. The pro forma information does not reflect the following\n•\nA $\n727\nmillion effect on net income attributable to MPC related to purchase accounting related inventory effects and transaction-related costs as these charges do not have a continuing impact on the consolidated results.\n•\nThe application of discontinued operations accounting for Speedway as the information required to apply discontinued operations accounting for periods prior to our ownership is not readily available.\nAcquisition of Terminal and Retail Locations in New York\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, we acquired a\n900,000\n-barrel capacity light product and asphalt terminal and\n33\nNOCO Express retail stores in Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester, New York, from NOCO Incorporated for total consideration of $\n135\nmillion.\nBased on the final fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, $\n38\nmillion of the purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment, $\n3\nmillion to inventory and $\n94\nmillion to goodwill. Goodwill is tax deductible and represents the value expected to be created by geographically expanding our retail platform and the assembled workforce. The terminal is accounted for within the Refining & Marketing segment and the retail stores were accounted for within our former Retail segment.\nThe amount of revenue and income from operations associated with the acquisition from the acquisition date to December 31, 2019 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, assuming the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2018, the consolidated pro forma results would not have been materially different from the reported results.\nAcquisition of Express Mart\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, Speedway acquired\n78\ntransportation fuel and convenience store locations from Petr-All Petroleum Consulting Corporation for total consideration of $\n266\nmillion. These stores are located primarily in the Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo markets in New York and operate under the Express Mart brand.\nBased on the final fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, $\n97\nmillion of the purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment, $\n9\nmillion to inventory, $\n2\nmillion to intangibles and $\n158\nmillion to goodwill. Goodwill is tax deductible and represents the value expected to be created by geographically expanding our retail platform and the assembled workforce.\nThe amount of revenue and income from operations associated with the acquisition from the acquisition date to December 31, 2018 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, assuming the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017, the consolidated pro forma results would not have been materially different from the reported results.\n116\nAcquisition of Mt. Airy Terminal\nOn September 26, 2018, MPLX acquired an eastern U.S. Gulf Coast export terminal (“Mt. Airy Terminal”) from Pin Oak Holdings, LLC for total consideration of $\n451\nmillion. At the time of the acquisition, the terminal included tanks with\n4\nmillion barrels of third-party leased storage capacity and a dock with\n120\nmbpd of capacity. The Mt. Airy Terminal is located on the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, near several Gulf Coast refineries, including our Garyville Refinery, and numerous rail lines and pipelines. The Mt. Airy Terminal is accounted for within the Midstream segment. In the first quarter of 2019, an adjustment to the initial purchase price was made for approximately $\n5\nmillion related to the final settlement of the acquisition. This reduced the total purchase price to $\n446\nmillion and resulted in $\n336\nmillion of property, plant and equipment, $\n121\nmillion of goodwill and the remainder being attributable to net liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill represents the significant growth potential of the terminal due to the multiple pipelines and rail lines which cross the property, the terminal’s position as an aggregation point for liquids growth in the region for both ocean-going vessels and inland barges, the proximity of the terminal to our Garyville refinery and other refineries in the region as well as the opportunity to construct an additional dock at the site. All of the goodwill recognized related to this transaction is tax deductible.\nThe amount of revenue and income from operations associated with the acquisition from the terminal acquisition date to December 31, 2018 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, assuming the terminal acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2017, the consolidated pro forma results would not have been materially different from the reported results.\n9.\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nConsolidated VIE\nWe control MPLX through our ownership of its general partner. MPLX is a VIE because the limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights over the general partner. We are the primary beneficiary of MPLX because in addition to our significant economic interest, we also have the ability, through our ownership of the general partner, to control the decisions that most significantly impact MPLX. We therefore consolidate MPLX and record a noncontrolling interest for the interest owned by the public. We also record a redeemable noncontrolling interest related to MPLX’s Series A preferred units.\nThe creditors of MPLX do not have recourse to MPC’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements, except as noted. MPC has effectively guaranteed certain indebtedness of LOOP LLC (“LOOP”) and LOCAP LLC (“LOCAP”), in which MPLX holds an interest. See Note 29 for more information. The assets of MPLX can only be used to settle its own obligations and its creditors have no recourse to our assets, except as noted earlier.\n117\nThe following table presents balance sheet information for the assets and liabilities of MPLX, which are included in our balance sheets.\nNon-Consolidated VIEs\nCrowley Coastal Partners\nIn May 2016, Crowley Coastal Partners LLC (“Crowley Coastal Partners”) was formed to own an interest in both Crowley Ocean Partners LLC (“Crowley Ocean Partners”) and Crowley Blue Water Partners LLC (“Crowley Blue Water Partners”). We have determined that Crowley Coastal Partners is a VIE based on the terms of the existing financing arrangements for Crowley Blue Water Partners and Crowley Ocean Partners and the associated debt guarantees by MPC and Crowley. Our maximum exposure to loss at December 31, 2020 was $\n424\nmillion, which includes our equity method investment in Crowley Coastal Partners and the debt guarantees provided to each of the lenders to Crowley Blue Water Partners and Crowley Ocean Partners. We are not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the ability to control the activities that significantly influence the economic outcomes of the entity and, therefore, do not consolidate the entity.\nMPLX VIEs\nFor those entities that have been deemed to be VIEs, neither MPLX nor any of its subsidiaries have been deemed to be the primary beneficiary due to voting rights on significant matters. While we have the ability to exercise influence through participation in the management committees which make all significant decisions, we have equal influence over each committee as a joint interest partner and all significant decisions require the consent of the other investors without regard to economic interest and as such we have determined that these entities should not be consolidated and apply the equity method of accounting with respect to our investments in each entity.\nSherwood Midstream has been deemed the primary beneficiary of Sherwood Midstream Holdings due to its controlling financial interest through its authority to manage the joint venture. As a result, Sherwood Midstream consolidates Sherwood Midstream Holdings.\n118\nMPLX’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with equity method investments includes its equity investment, any additional capital contribution commitments and any operating expenses incurred by the subsidiary operator in excess of its compensation received for the performance of the operating services.\nWe account for our ownership interest in each of these investments as an equity method investment. See Note 17 for ownership percentages and investment balances related to our non-consolidated VIEs.\n10.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nTransactions with related parties were as follows:\nSales to related parties, which are included in sales and other operating revenues, consist primarily of refined product sales to certain of our equity affiliates.\nPurchases from related parties are included in cost of revenues. We obtain utilities, transportation services and purchase ethanol from certain of our equity affiliates.\n11.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nWe compute basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) attributable to MPC less income allocated to participating securities by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.\nSince MPC grants certain incentive compensation awards to employees and non-employee directors that are considered to be participating securities, we have calculated our earnings (loss) per share using the two-class method. Diluted income (loss) per share assumes exercise of certain stock-based compensation awards, provided the effect is not anti-dilutive.\n119\nThe following table summarizes the shares that were anti-dilutive, and therefore, were excluded from the diluted share calculation.\n12.\nEQUITY\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $\n2.96\nbillion of remaining share repurchase authorizations from our board of directors. We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nTotal share repurchases were as follows for the respective periods:\n120\n13.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nOn August 2, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Speedway to 7-Eleven for $\n21\nbillion in cash, subject to certain adjustments based on the levels of cash, debt and working capital at closing and certain other items. In connection with the announced sale, we reassessed our organizational structure and management of segments. As a result of this assessment, we have made the following changes for all periods presented:\n•\nSpeedway’s results are presented separately as discontinued operations. See Note 5 for related disclosures.\n•\nRefining & Marketing intersegment sales to Speedway that were previously eliminated in consolidation are reported as third party sales as we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway following its disposition.\n•\nThe retained direct dealer business results, previously included in the Retail segment, are reported within the Refining & Marketing segment.\n•\nAs a result of the above, we no longer present a separate Retail segment, which had included these two businesses.\n•\nCorporate costs are no longer allocated to Speedway under discontinued operations accounting.\nWe have\ntwo\nreportable segments: Refining & Marketing and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers.\n•\nRefining & Marketing – refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our refineries in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided largely by our Midstream segment. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily Marathon\n®\nbranded outlets, through long-term supply contracts with direct dealers who operate locations mainly under the ARCO\n®\nbrand and to approximately 3,800 Speedway locations.\n•\nMidstream – transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the Refining & Marketing segment via refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats and barges; gathers, processes and transports natural gas; and gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs. The Midstream segment primarily reflects the results of MPLX.\nOn October 1, 2018, we acquired Andeavor and its results are included in each of our segments from the date of the acquisition. Also, on February 1, 2018, we contributed certain refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. The results of these new businesses are reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from February 1, 2018, resulting in a net reduction to Refining & Marketing segment results and a net increase to Midstream segment results of the same amount. No effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to February 1, 2018.\nSegment income from operations represents income (loss) from operations attributable to the reportable segments. Corporate administrative expenses, except for those attributable to MPLX, and costs related to certain non-operating assets are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing segment. In addition, certain items that affect comparability (as determined by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”)) are not allocated to the reportable segments. Assets by segment are not a measure used to assess the performance of the company by the CODM and thus are not reported in our disclosures.\n121\n(a)\nIncludes Refining & Marketing sales to Speedway (as discussed above) and related party sales. See Note 10 for additional information.\n(b)\nDifferences between segment totals and MPC consolidated totals represent amounts related to corporate and other items not allocated to segments.\n(c)\nIncludes changes in capital expenditure accruals and investments in affiliates.\n122\nThe following reconciles segment income (loss) from operations to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes as reported in the consolidated statements of income:\n(a)\nCorporate consists primarily of MPC’s corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets, except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX, which are included in the Midstream segment. Corporate includes corporate costs of $26 million, $28 million and $26 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that are no longer allocable to Speedway under discontinued operations accounting.\n(b)\n2020 reflects impairments of goodwill, equity method investments and long lived assets. 2019 reflects impairments of goodwill and equity method investments. See Note 7. 2018 includes MPC’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the Sandpiper pipeline project, which was cancelled and impaired in 2016.\n(c)\nSee Note 4.\n(d)\n2020 and 2019 includes costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts. Both 2019 and 2018 include employee severance, retention and other costs related to the acquisition of Andeavor. Effective October 1, 2019, we have discontinued reporting Andeavor transaction-related costs as one year has passed since the acquisition and these costs are immaterial. Costs incurred in connection with the Speedway separation are included in discontinued operations. See Note 5\n.\n(e)\nIncludes gains related to The Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC and Capline Pipeline Company LLC. See Note 17.\nThe following reconciles segment capital expenditures and investments to total capital expenditures:\n(a)\nIncludes changes in capital expenditure accruals. See Note 24 for a reconciliation of total capital expenditures to additions to property, plant and equipment as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows\n.\nSince we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway following its disposition, we have reported intersegment sales to Speedway, that were previously eliminated in consolidation, as third party sales in all periods presented. Sales to Speedway from the Refining & Marketing segment represented\n11\npercent,\n12\npercent and\n13\npercent of our total annual revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Note 23 for the disaggregation of our revenue by segment and product line.\nWe do not have significant operations in foreign countries. Therefore, revenues in foreign countries and long-lived assets located in foreign countries, including property, plant and equipment and investments, are not material to our operations.\n123\n14.\nNET INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL COSTS\nNet interest and other financial costs were as follows:\n(a)\nSee Note 26.\n15.\nINCOME TAXES\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contained a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryback provision, which allowed MPC to carryback our 2020 taxable loss to 2015 and later years. The five-year NOL carryback is available for all businesses producing taxable losses in 2018 through 2020. Based on the NOL carryback, as provided by the CARES Act, we recorded an income tax receivable of $\n2.1\nbillion in other current assets to reflect our estimate of the tax refund we expect to receive from our 2020 federal tax return. The refund is expected to be received during the second half of 2021.\nIn the absence of the CARES Act NOL legislation, businesses would account for taxable losses as deferred tax assets and could realize the deferred tax asset by offsetting the losses against taxable income earned in future periods. Due to the corporate tax rate change from 35 percent to the current 21 percent under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, taxpayers may recover taxes paid in tax years before 2018 at a 35 percent federal income tax rate. The limitation on the percentage of taxable income that may be offset by the NOL, formerly 80 percent of income, was eliminated for years beginning before 2021.\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of:\n124\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate applied to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes follows:\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities resulted from the following:\nThe above table reflects reclassifications of December 31, 2019 balances from property, plant and equipment to finance lease obligations, operating lease liabilities, goodwill and other intangibles and right of use assets to correct the presentation of these deferred tax assets and liabilities that were previously presented as property, plant and equipment deferred tax liabilities.\n125\nNet deferred tax liabilities were classified in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\n(a)\nThe deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with discontinued operations remain in our balance sheet rather than being included in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are held for sale, as the sale is structured as a sale of assets.  These discontinued operations deferred income tax assets and liabilities will be realized upon the sale of Speedway.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, federal operating loss carryforwards were $\n4\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively, which includes a mix of indefinite carryforward ability and expiration periods ranging from 2022 through 2037. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, state and local operating loss carryforwards were $\n228\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion, respectively, which includes a mix of indefinite carryforward ability and expiration periods ranging from 2021 through 2042.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $\n11\nmillion of valuation allowances have been recorded related to income taxes. A federal valuation allowance was established for December 31, 2020 and 2019, of $\n2\nmillion, primarily due to the expected realizability of foreign tax credits. A state and local valuation allowance was established as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, of $\n9\nmillion, based on expected realizability of state and local tax operating losses.\nMPC is continuously undergoing examination of its U.S. federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Since 2012, we have continued to participate in the Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”). CAP is a real-time audit of the U.S. Federal income tax return that allows the IRS, working in conjunction with MPC, to determine tax return compliance with the U.S. Federal tax law prior to filing the return. This program provides us with greater certainty about our tax liability for years under examination by the IRS. While Andeavor also underwent continual IRS examination, it did not participate in the CAP for tax periods prior to October 1, 2018.\nAndeavor and its subsidiaries’ IRS audits have been completed through the 2015 tax year. We believe adequate provisions have been established for potential tax in periods not closed to examination. Further, we are routinely involved in U.S. state income tax audits. We believe all other audits will be resolved with the amounts provided for these liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, our federal income tax returns remain subject to examination for years\n2016\nthrough\n2019\n. As of December 31, 2020, we have various state and local income tax returns subject to examination for years\n2006\nthrough\n2019\n, depending on jurisdiction.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in unrecognized tax benefits:\nIf the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 were recognized, $\n14\nmillion would affect our effective income tax rate. There were $\n9\nmillion of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 for which it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits would significantly decrease during the next twelve months. For tax years 2009 and 2010, Andeavor had asserted a federal income tax claim for $\n159\nmillion from the income tax effect of the receipt of the ethanol blender’s excise tax credit, for which the tax benefit was not recorded. The statute of limitations for the IRS appeal process expired during the fourth quarter 2019 since the ability to obtain a refund was remote.\n126\nPursuant to our tax sharing agreement with Marathon Oil, the unrecognized tax benefits related to pre-spinoff operations for which Marathon Oil was the taxpayer remain the responsibility of Marathon Oil and we have indemnified Marathon Oil accordingly. See Note 29 for indemnification information.\nInterest and penalties related to income taxes are recorded as part of the provision for income taxes. Such interest and penalties were net expenses (benefits) of $(\n19\n) million, $(\n2\n) million and $\n1\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $(\n5\n) million and $\n7\nmillion of interest and penalties were accrued related to income taxes.\n16.\nINVENTORIES\nThe LIFO method accounted for\n88\npercent and\n90\npercent of total inventory value at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was\nno\nexcess of replacement or current cost over our stated LIFO cost as of December 31, 2020. Current acquisition costs were estimated to exceed the LIFO inventory value by $\n787\nmillion at December 31, 2019\nThe cost of inventories of crude oil and refined products is determined primarily under the LIFO method. During 2020, we recorded a $\n561\nmillion charge to reflect LIFO liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers which were liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in the charge to cost of revenues. There were\nno\nliquidations of LIFO inventories in 2019 and 2018. .\n17.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nThe Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC\nEffective October 1, 2019, The Andersons, Inc. and MPC contributed jointly owned equity interests in three ethanol entities into a new legal entity, The Andersons Marathon Holdings LLC (“TAMH”). Concurrently, The Andersons, Inc. contributed a wholly-owned ethanol facility to TAMH. In accordance with ASC 845, we derecognized the historical cost of our equity method investments in the legacy entities amounting to $\n123\nmillion and recognized the new equity method investment in TAMH at fair value. We used a combination of market, income and cost approaches to determine the fair value of our ownership interest in TAMH with more reliance on the market and income approaches. The estimated cash flows used in the income approach were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital estimate and the market approach utilized EBITDA and capacity multiples for similar companies and transactions. This is a nonrecurring fair value measurement and is recognized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We estimated the fair value of our ownership interest to be $\n175\nmillion. The excess of the estimated fair value of our ownership interest over the carrying value of the derecognized net assets resulted in a $\n52\nmillion non-cash net gain recorded as a net gain on disposal of assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nCapline LLC\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2019, we executed agreements with Capline Pipeline Company LLC (“Capline LLC”) to contribute our\n33\npercent undivided interest in the Capline pipeline system in exchange for a\n33\npercent ownership interest in Capline LLC. In connection with our execution of these agreements, Capline LLC initiated a binding open season for southbound service from Patoka, Illinois to St. James, Louisiana or Liberty, Mississippi with an additional origination point at Cushing, Oklahoma. Service from Cushing, Oklahoma is part of a joint tariff with Diamond pipeline.\n127\nIn accordance with ASC 810, we derecognized our undivided interest amounting to $\n143\nmillion of net assets and recognized the Capline LLC ownership interest we received at fair value. We used an income approach to determine the fair value of our ownership interest under a Monte Carlo simulation method. We estimated the fair value of our ownership interest to be $\n350\nmillion. This is a nonrecurring fair value measurement and is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Monte Carlo simulation inputs include ranges of tariff rates, operating volumes, operating cost and capital expenditure assumptions. The estimated cash flows were discounted using a Monte Carlo market participant weighted average cost of capital estimate. None of the inputs to the Monte Carlo simulation are individually significant. The excess of the estimated fair value of our ownership interest over the carrying value of the derecognized net assets resulted in a $\n207\nmillion non-cash net gain recorded as a net gain on disposal of assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nAs the Capline system is currently idled, Capline LLC is unable to fund its operations without financial support from its equity owners and is a VIE. MPC is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, due to our inability to unilaterally control significant decision-making rights. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with Capline LLC includes our equity investment, any additional capital contribution commitments and any operating expenses incurred by Capline LLC in excess of compensation received for performance of the operating services.\n128\nInvestments in Equity Method Affiliates\n(a)\nDuring 2020, MPLX contributed its ownership in Wink to Webster Pipeline LLC to W2W Holdings LLC.\n(b)\nSome investments included within “Other” have been deemed to be VIEs\n.\n129\nSummarized financial information for all equity method investments in affiliated companies, combined, was as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our equity method investments was $\n361\nmillion higher than the underlying net assets of investees. This basis difference is being amortized into net income over the remaining estimated useful lives of the underlying net assets, except for $\n199\nmillion of excess related to goodwill and other non-depreciable assets.\nDividends and partnership distributions received from equity method investees (excluding distributions that represented a return of capital previously contributed) were $\n577\nmillion, $\n569\nmillion and $\n458\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nSee Note 7 for information regarding impairments of equity method investments.\n18.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n(a)\nRecast to include the direct dealer business. See Note 13 for additional information.\n(b)\nThe December 31, 2020 balance includes property, plant and equipment impairment charges recorded during 2020. See Note 7 for additional information.\nProperty, plant and equipment includes gross assets acquired under finance leases of $\n819\nmillion and $\n740\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with related amounts in accumulated depreciation of $\n272\nmillion and $\n215\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Property, plant and equipment includes construction in progress of $\n1.83\nbillion and $\n3.12\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which primarily relates to capital projects at our refineries and midstream facilities.\n19.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES\nGoodwill\nManagement annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as of November 30, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying amount. In 2020 and 2019, we recorded impairments of goodwill as\n130\noutlined in Note 7. There were no other impairments of goodwill required based on our annual test of goodwill in 2020 and 2019.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for 2019 and 2020 were as follows:\n(a)\nRecast to include the direct dealer business. See Note 13 for additional information.\n(b)\nSee Note 7.\nIntangible Assets\nOur definite lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as shown below.\nAt both December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had indefinite lived intangible assets $\n71\nmillion, which are emission allowance credits.\nAmortization expense for 2020 and 2019 was $\n336\nmillion and $\n357\nmillion, respectively.\nEstimated future amortization expense for the next five years related to the intangible assets at December 31, 2020 is as follows:\n131\n20.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair Values – Recurring\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 by fair value hierarchy level. We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral as shown below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented on a gross basis in the following tables.\n(a)\nRepresents the impact of netting assets, liabilities and cash collateral when a legal right of offset exists. As of December 31, 2020, cash collateral of $\n11\nmillion was netted with mark-to-market liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, cash collateral of $\n51\nmillion was netted with mark-to-market derivative liabilities.\n(b)\nWe have no derivative contracts which are subject to master netting arrangements reflected gross on the balance sheet.\nCommodity derivatives in Level 1 are exchange-traded contracts for crude oil and refined products measured at fair value with a market approach using the close-of-day settlement prices for the market. Commodity derivatives are covered under master netting agreements with an unconditional right to offset. Collateral deposits in futures commission merchant accounts covered by master netting agreements related to Level 1 commodity derivatives are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nLevel 2 instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices, such as liquidity, that are observable for the asset or liability. Commodity derivatives in Level 2 are OTC contracts, which are valued using market quotations from independent price reporting agencies, third-party brokers and commodity exchange price curves that are corroborated with market data.\nLevel 3 instruments include embedded derivatives in commodity contracts. The embedded derivative liability relates to a natural gas purchase agreement embedded in a keep‑whole processing agreement. The fair value calculation for these Level 3 instruments at December 31, 2020 used significant unobservable inputs including: (1) NGL prices interpolated and extrapolated due to inactive markets ranging from $\n0.47\nto $\n1.09\nper gallon with a weighted average of $\n0.59\nper gallon and (2) the probability of renewal of\n100\npercent for the first and second five-year term of the natural gas purchase agreement and the related keep-whole processing agreement. Increases or decreases in the fractionation spread result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability.\n132\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances recorded for net liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nSee Note 21 for the income statement impacts of our derivative instruments.\nFair Values – Reported\nWe believe the carrying value of our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including the short-term duration of the instruments and the expected insignificance of bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term loan facility, which include variable interest rates, approximate fair value. The fair value of our fixed and floating rate long-term debt is based on prices from recent trade activity and is categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying and fair values of our debt were approximately $\n31.1\nbillion and $\n34.9\nbillion at December 31, 2020, respectively, and approximately $\n28.3\nbillion and $\n30.1\nbillion at December 31, 2019, respectively. These carrying and fair values of our debt exclude the unamortized issuance costs which are netted against our total debt.\n21.\nDERIVATIVES\nFor further information regarding the fair value measurement of derivative instruments, including any effect of master netting agreements or collateral, see Note 20. See Note 2 for a discussion of the types of derivatives we use and the reasons for them. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.\nThe following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the line items in the balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. The fair value amounts below are presented on a gross basis and do not reflect the netting of asset and liability positions permitted under the terms of our master netting arrangements including cash collateral on deposit with, or received from, brokers. We offset the recognized fair value amounts for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty in our financial statements when a legal right of offset exists. As a result, the asset and liability amounts below will not agree with the amounts presented in our consolidated balance sheets.\n133\n(a)\nIncludes embedded derivatives.\nThe table below summarizes open commodity derivative contracts for crude oil, refined products and blending products as of December 31, 2020.\n(a)\nIncluded in exchange-traded are spread contracts in thousands of barrels: Refined products -\n935\nlong and\n455\nshort\nThe following table summarizes the effect of all commodity derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of income:\n134\n22.\nDEBT\nOur outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following:\nCommercial Paper\nOn February 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $\n2\nbillion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to\n397\ndays from the date of issuance. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities.\n135\nMPC Senior Notes\nOn April 27, 2020, we issued $\n2.5\nbillion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $\n1.25\nbillion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% unsecured senior notes due May 2023 and $\n1.25\nbillion aggregate principal amount of 4.700% unsecured senior notes due May 2025. MPC used the net proceeds from this offering to repay amounts outstanding under its five-year revolving credit facility.\nOn October 1, 2020, all of the $\n475\nmillion outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due October 2022, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par.\nOn November 15, 2020, all of the $\n650\nmillion outstanding aggregate principal amount of 3.400% senior notes due December 2020 were redeemed at a price equal to par.\nInterest on each series of senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The MPC senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of MPC and rank equally with all of MPC’s other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The MPC senior notes are non-recourse and structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, including the outstanding indebtedness of Andeavor, MPLX and ANDX. The Andeavor senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Andeavor and are non-recourse to MPC and any of MPC’s subsidiaries other than Andeavor.\nMPLX Term Loan Facility\nThe $\n1.0\nbillion of outstanding borrowings under the MPLX term loan facility was repaid during 2020 with net proceeds from the issuance of MPLX senior notes discussed below.\n136\nMPLX Senior Notes\n2020 Activity\nOn August 18, 2020, MPLX issued $\n3.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $\n1.5\nbillion aggregate principal amount of 1.750% senior notes due March 2026 and $\n1.5\nbillion aggregate principal amount of 2.650% senior notes due August 2030. The net proceeds were used to repay $\n1.0\nbillion of outstanding borrowings under the MPLX term loan agreement, to repay the $\n1.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due September 2021, to redeem all of the $\n300\nmillion aggregate principal amount of MPLX’s 6.250% senior notes due October 2022 and to redeem the $\n450\nmillion aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due May 2024, including the portion of such notes issued by ANDX. The remaining net proceeds were used for general business purposes.\nOn December 29, 2020, MPLX announced the redemption of all the $\n750\nmillion outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due January 2025, including the portion of such notes issued by ANDX. The notes were redeemed on January 15, 2021 at a price equal to 102.625% of the principal amount. These notes are included in long-term debt due within one year in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.\n2019 Activity\nOn September 9, 2019, MPLX issued $\n2.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $\n1.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of notes due September 2021 and $\n1.0\nbillion aggregate principal amount of notes due September 2022. Net proceeds from the issuance of\n137\nthe floating rate senior notes were used to repay MPLX’s existing indebtedness and/or for general business purposes. The interest rate applicable to the floating rate senior notes due September 2021 is LIBOR plus 0.9% per annum while the interest rate applicable to the floating rate senior notes due September 2022 is LIBOR plus 1.1% per annum. Interest is payable in March, June, September and December, commencing on December 9, 2019. Both series of floating rate notes are callable, in whole or in part, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after September 10, 2020.\nIn connection with MPLX’s acquisition of ANDX on July 30, 2019, MPLX assumed ANDX’s outstanding senior notes, which had an aggregate principal amount of $\n3.75\nbillion, with interest rates ranging from 3.500% to 6.375% and maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2047. On September 23, 2019, approximately $\n3.06\nbillion aggregate principal amount of ANDX’s outstanding senior notes were exchanged for new unsecured senior notes issued by MPLX having the same maturity and interest rates as the ANDX senior notes in an exchange offer and consent solicitation undertaken by MPLX, leaving approximately $\n690\nmillion aggregate principal of outstanding senior notes issued by ANDX. Of this, $\n500\nmillion was related to the 5.500% unsecured senior notes due 2019. The principal amount of $\n500\nmillion and accrued interest of $\n14\nmillion was paid on October 15, 2019, which included interest through the payoff date.\nInterest on each series of MPLX fixed rate senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The MPLX senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of MPLX and are non-recourse to MPC and its subsidiaries other than MPLX and MPLX GP LLC, as the general partner of MPLX except as otherwise noted.\nSchedule of Maturities\nPrincipal maturities of long-term debt, excluding finance lease obligations, as of December 31, 2020 for the next five years are as follows:\nAvailable Capacity under our Facilities as of December 31, 2020\n(a)\nBorrowed $\n4.225\nbillion and repaid $\n4.225\nbillion during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(b)\nBorrowed $\n3.550\nbillion and repaid $\n3.550\nbillion during the year ended December 31, 2020. Availability under our $\n750\nmillion trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products.\n(c)\nBorrowed $\n3.815\nbillion and repaid $\n3.640\nbillion during the year ended December 31, 2020\n.\n138\nMPC Revolving Credit Agreements\nOn August 28, 2018, in connection with the Andeavor acquisition, MPC entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders providing for a $\n5.0\nbillion five-year revolving credit facility that expires in 2023. The five-year credit agreement became effective on October 1, 2018.\nOn September 23, 2020, MPC entered into a 364-day credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. This revolving credit agreement provides for a $\n1.0\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in September 2021, and replaces a similar 364-day revolving credit agreement that expired on September 28, 2020.\nOn April 27, 2020, MPC entered into an additional 364-day revolving credit agreement that provides for a $\n1.0\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2021. In February 2021, we elected to terminate this credit agreement. This facility provided us with additional liquidity and financial flexibility during the then ongoing commodity price and demand downturn. There were no borrowings under this credit facility, and we determined that the incremental borrowing capacity of the facility was no longer necessary. We do not intend to replace this facility. We incurred no early termination fees as a result of the early termination of this credit agreement.\nMPC has an option under its $\n5.0\nbillion five-year credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments by up to an additional $\n1.0\nbillion, subject to, among other conditions, the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. In addition, MPC may request up to\ntwo\none-year extensions of the maturity date of the five-year credit agreement subject to, among other conditions, the consent of lenders holding a majority of the commitments, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will terminate on the then-effective maturity date. The five-year credit agreement includes sub-facilities for swing-line loans of up to $\n250\nmillion and letters of credit of up to $\n2.2\nbillion (which may be increased to up to $\n3.0\nbillion upon receipt of additional letter of credit issuing commitments).\nBorrowings under the MPC credit agreements bear interest, at our election,\nat either the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate (both as defined in the MPC credit agreements), plus an applicable margin\n. We are charged various fees and expenses under the MPC credit agreements, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the commitments and fees related to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable margins to the benchmark interest rates and the commitment fees payable under the MPC credit agreements fluctuate based on changes, if any, to our credit ratings.\nThe MPC credit agreements contain certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (each as defined in the MPC credit agreements) of no greater than\n0.65\nto 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The covenants also restrict, among other things, our ability and/or the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens on assets or enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPC credit agreements.\nTrade Receivables Securitization Facility\nThe trade receivables facility consists of our wholly-owned subsidiaries selling or contributing on an on-going basis all of their trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to another wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary, MPC Trade Receivables Company LLC (“TRC”), in exchange for a combination of cash, equity and/or borrowings under a subordinated note issued by TRC. TRC, in turn, has the ability to sell undivided ownership interests in qualifying trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to the purchasing group in exchange for cash proceeds. The trade receivables facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $\n750\nmillion, provided that the aggregate credit exposure of the purchasing group, including outstanding letters of credit, may not exceed the lesser of $\n750\nmillion or the balance of qualifying trade receivables at any one time.\nTo the extent that TRC retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received under the facility, such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of TRC with those of MPC. The receivables sold or contributed to TRC are available first and foremost to satisfy claims of the creditors of TRC and are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of MPC. TRC has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the purchasing group to secure its obligations under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.\n139\nProceeds from the sale of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables under the trade receivables facility are reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet. We remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to the purchasing group. TRC pays floating-rate interest charges and usage fees on amounts outstanding under the trade receivables facility, if any, unused fees on the portion of unused commitments and certain other fees related to the administration of the facility and letters of credit that are issued and outstanding under the trade receivables facility.\nThe receivables purchase agreement and receivables sale agreement contain representations and covenants that we consider usual and customary for arrangements of this type. Trade receivables are subject to customary criteria, limits and reserves before being deemed to qualify for sale by TRC pursuant to the trade receivables facility. In addition, further purchases of qualified trade receivables under the trade receivables facility are subject to termination, and TRC may be subject to default fees, upon the occurrence of certain amortization events that are included in the receivables purchase agreement, all of which we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the receivables purchase agreement and receivables sale agreement.\nMPLX Credit Agreement\nUpon the completion of the merger of MPLX and ANDX on July 30, 2019, the MPLX bank revolving credit facility was amended and restated to increase the borrowing capacity to $\n3.5\nbillion and to extend the maturity date to July 30, 2024. The ANDX revolving and dropdown credit facilities were terminated and all outstanding balances were repaid and funded with borrowings under the amended and restated MPLX $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facility.\nThe MPLX credit agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to approximately $\n300\nmillion and swingline loan capacity of up to $\n150\nmillion. The revolving borrowing capacity may be increased by up to an additional $\n1.0\nbillion, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase.\nBorrowings under the MPLX credit agreement bear interest, at MPLX’s election,\nat the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the Alternate Base Rate (both as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) plus an applicable margin\n. MPLX is charged various fees and expenses in connection with the agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the commitments and fees with respect to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable margins to the benchmark interest rates and the commitment fees payable under the MPLX credit agreement fluctuate based on changes, if any, to MPLX’s credit ratings.\nThe MPLX credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a financial covenant that requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) for the prior\nfour\nfiscal quarters of no greater than\n5.0\nto 1.0 (or\n5.5\nto 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. The covenants also restrict, among other things, MPLX’s ability and/or the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens on assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2020, MPLX was in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPLX credit agreement.\n140\n23.\nREVENUE\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 13, the presentation of Refining & Marketing segment revenues reflects changes associated with the expected sale of Speedway and our new reportable segments. The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by segment and product line:\nWe do not disclose information on the future performance obligations for any contract with expected duration of one year or less at inception. As of December 31, 2020, we do not have future performance obligations that are material to future periods.\nReceivables\nOn the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, receivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts primarily consists of customer receivables. Significant, non-customer balances included in our receivables at December 31, 2020 include matching buy/sell receivables of $\n2.08\nbillion.\n141\n24.\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\n(a)\nDisclosure added in 2019 following the adoption of ASC 842.\n(b)\n2019 includes the contribution of net assets to TAMH and Capline LLC. See Note 17.\n(c)\n2019 includes the recognition of TAMH and Capline LLC equity method investments. See Note 17.\n(a)\nExcludes $\n140\nmillion and $\n134\nmillion of cash included in assets held for sale representing Speedway store cash.\n(b)\nThe restricted cash balance is included within other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. The following is a reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to total capital expenditures:\n142\n25.\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe following table shows the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component. Amounts in parentheses indicate debits.\n(a)\nThese accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost. See Note 26.\n143\n26.\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nWe have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees. Benefits under these plans have been based primarily on age, years of service and final average pensionable earnings. The years of service component of these formulae was frozen as of December 31, 2009. Certain of the pensionable earnings components were frozen as of December 31, 2012.\nBenefits for service beginning January 1, 2010 and beginning on January 1, 2016 are based on a cash balance formula with an annual percentage of eligible pay credited based upon age and years of service or at a flat rate of eligible pay, depending on covered employee group. Substantially all of our employees also accrue benefits under a defined contribution plan.\nWe also have other postretirement benefits covering most employees. Retiree health care benefits are provided through comprehensive hospital, surgical, major medical benefit, prescription drug and related health benefit provisions subject to various cost sharing features. Retiree life insurance benefits are provided to a closed group of retirees. Other postretirement benefits are not funded in advance.\nIn connection with the Andeavor acquisition, we assumed a number of additional qualified and nonqualified noncontributory benefit pension plans, covering substantially all former Andeavor employees. Benefits under these plans are determined based on final average compensation and years of service through December 31, 2010 and a cash balance formula for service beginning January 1, 2011. These plans were frozen as of December 31, 2018. Further, as of December 31, 2019, the qualified plans were merged with our existing qualified plans in which the actuarial assumptions were materially the same between the plans. We also assumed a number of additional postretirement benefits covering eligible employees. These benefits were merged with our existing benefits beginning January 1, 2019.\nObligations and Funded Status\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n3,369\nmillion and $\n3,013\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following summarizes our defined benefit pension plans that have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\n144\nThe following summarizes the projected benefit obligations and funded status for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans:\n(a)\nThe primary driver of the actuarial loss for the pension plans in 2020 and 2019 was the decrease in interest rates. The plans also saw moderate losses related to demographic experience in each year.\n(b)\nAmounts exclude those related to LOOP and Explorer, equity method investees with defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for which net losses of $\n16\nmillion and less than $\n1\nmillion were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2020, reflecting our ownership share.\n145\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following summarizes the net periodic benefit costs and the amounts recognized as other comprehensive loss for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.\n(a)\nNet periodic benefit cost reflects a calculated market-related value of plan assets which recognizes changes in fair value over three years.\nFor certain of our pension plans, lump sum payments to employees retiring in 2020, 2019 and 2018 exceeded the plan’s total service and interest costs expected for those years. Settlement losses are required to be recorded when lump sum payments exceed total service and interest costs. As a result, pension settlement expenses were recorded in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nPlan Assumptions\nThe following summarizes the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December 31, and net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n146\nExpected Long-term Return on Plan Assets\nThe overall expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is determined based on an asset rate-of-return modeling tool developed by a third-party investment group. The tool utilizes underlying assumptions based on actual returns by asset category and inflation and takes into account our asset allocation to derive an expected long-term rate of return on those assets. Capital market assumptions reflect the long-term capital market outlook. The assumptions for equity and fixed income investments are developed using a building-block approach, reflecting observable inflation information and interest rate information available in the fixed income markets. Long-term assumptions for other asset categories are based on historical results, current market characteristics and the professional judgment of our internal and external investment teams\n.\nAssumed Health Care Cost Trend\nThe following summarizes the assumed health care cost trend rates.\nIncreases in the post-65 medical plan premium for the Marathon Petroleum Health Plan and the Marathon Petroleum Retiree Health Plan are the lower of the trend rate or\nfour\npercent.\nPlan Investment Policies and Strategies\nThe investment policies for our pension plan assets reflect the funded status of the plans and expectations regarding our future ability to make further contributions. Long-term investment goals are to: (1) manage the assets in accordance with the legal requirements of all applicable laws; (2) diversify plan investments across asset classes to achieve an optimal balance between risk and return and between income and growth of assets through capital appreciation; and (3) source benefit payments primarily through existing plan assets and anticipated future returns.\nThe investment goals are implemented to manage the plans’ funded status volatility and minimize future cash contributions.\nThe asset allocation strategy will change over time in response to changes primarily in funded status, which is dictated by current and anticipated market conditions, the independent actions of our investment committee, required cash flows to and from the plans and other factors deemed appropriate. Such changes in asset allocation are intended to allocate additional assets to the fixed income asset class should the funded status improve. The fixed income asset class shall be invested in such a manner that its interest rate sensitivity correlates highly with that of the plans’ liabilities. Other asset classes are intended to provide additional return with associated higher levels of risk. Investment performance and risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment meetings and periodic asset and liability studies.\nAt December 31, 2020, the primary plan’s targeted asset allocation was\n50\npercent equity, private equity, real estate, and timber securities and\n50\npercent fixed income securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nPlan assets are measured at fair value. The following provides a description of the valuation techniques employed for each major plan asset category at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include a collective fund serving as the investment vehicle for the cash reserves and cash held by third-party investment managers. The collective fund is valued at net asset value (“NAV”)\n147\non a scheduled basis using a cost approach, and is considered a Level 2 asset. Cash and cash equivalents held by third-party investment managers are valued using a cost approach and are considered Level 2.\nEquity\nEquity investments includes common stock, mutual and pooled funds. Common stock investments are valued using a market approach, which are priced daily in active markets and are considered Level 1. Mutual and pooled equity funds are well diversified portfolios, representing a mix of strategies in domestic, international and emerging market strategies. Mutual funds are publicly registered, valued at NAV on a daily basis using a market approach and are considered Level 1 assets. Pooled funds are valued at NAV using a market approach and are considered Level 2.\nFixed Income\nFixed income investments include corporate bonds, U.S. dollar treasury bonds and municipal bonds. These securities are priced on observable inputs using a combination of market, income and cost approaches. These securities are considered Level 2 assets. Fixed income also includes a well diversified bond portfolio structured as a pooled fund. This fund is valued at NAV on a daily basis using a market approach and is considered Level 2. Other investments classified as Level 1 include mutual funds that are publicly registered, valued at NAV on a daily basis using a market approach.\nPrivate Equity\nPrivate equity investments include interests in limited partnerships which are valued using information provided by external managers for each individual investment held in the fund. These holdings are considered Level 3.\nReal Estate\nReal estate investments consist of interests in limited partnerships. These holdings are either appraised or valued using the investment manager’s assessment of assets held. These holdings are considered Level 3.\nOther\nOther investments include two limited liability companies (“LLCs”) with no public market. The LLCs were formed to acquire timberland in the northwest U.S. These holdings are either appraised or valued using the investment manager’s assessment of assets held. These holdings are considered Level 3. Other investments classified as Level 1 include publicly traded depository receipts.\nThe following tables present the fair values of our defined benefit pension plans’ assets, by level within the fair value hierarchy, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n148\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances recorded for plan assets classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy:\nCash Flows\nContributions to defined benefit plans\nOur funding policy with respect to the funded pension plans is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, including requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, plus such additional, discretionary, amounts from time to time as determined appropriate by management. In 2020, we made contributions totaling $\n3\nmillion to our funded pension plans.\nFor 2021, we have $65 million of required funding, but we may also make voluntary contributions to our funded pension plans\n149\nat our discretion.\nCash contributions to be paid from our general assets for the unfunded pension and postretirement plans are estimated to be approximately $\n82\nmillion and $\n52\nmillion, respectively, in 2021.\nEstimated future benefit payments\nThe following gross benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in the years indicated.\nContributions to defined contribution plan\nWe also contribute to a defined contribution plan for eligible employees. Contributions to this plan totaled $\n180\nmillion, $\n181\nmillion and $\n118\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nMultiemployer Pension Plan\nWe contribute to\none\nmultiemployer defined benefit pension plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement that covers some of our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in this multiemployer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n•\nAssets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n•\nIf a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\n•\nIf we choose to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nOur participation in this plan for 2020, 2019 and 2018 is outlined in the table below. The “EIN” column provides the Employee Identification Number for the plan. The most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2020 and 2019 is for the plan’s year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded. The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates a financial improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement to which the plan is subject. There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of 2020, 2019 and 2018 contributions. Our portion of the contributions does not make up more than five percent of total contributions to the plan.\n(a)\nThis agreement has a minimum contribution requirement of $\n338\nper week per employee for 2021. A total of\n275\nemployees participated in the plan as of December 31, 2020.\nMultiemployer Health and Welfare Plan\nWe contribute to\none\nmultiemployer health and welfare plan that covers both active employees and retirees. Through the health and welfare plan employees receive medical, dental, vision, prescription and disability coverage. Our contributions to this plan totaled $\n7\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n150\n27.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nDescription of the Plans\nEffective April 26, 2012, our employees and non-employee directors became eligible to receive equity awards under the Amended and Restated Marathon Petroleum Corporation 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan (“MPC 2012 Plan”). The MPC 2012 Plan authorizes the Compensation and Organization Development Committee of our board of directors (“Committee”) to grant non-qualified or incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards (including restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards), cash awards and performance awards to our employees and non-employee directors. Under the MPC 2012 Plan, no more than\n50\nmillion shares of our common stock may be delivered and no more than\n20\nmillion shares of our common stock may be the subject of awards that are not stock options or stock appreciation rights. In the sole discretion of the Committee,\n20\nmillion shares of our common stock may be granted as incentive stock options. Shares issued as a result of awards granted under these plans are funded through the issuance of new MPC common shares.\nPrior to April 26, 2012, our employees and non-employee directors were eligible to receive equity awards under the Marathon Petroleum Corporation 2011 Second Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (“MPC 2011 Plan”).\nIn connection with the Andeavor acquisition in October of 2018, we converted the outstanding option and equity incentive awards (other than awards held by non-employee directors of Andeavor, which awards were paid out in connection with the acquisition) under the Andeavor plans to awards that provide for rights to acquire (in the case of options) or be settled in or otherwise determined in reference to shares of MPC common stock in place of shares of Andeavor common stock (in the case of equity incentive awards). As part of that conversion, we used an exchange ratio for the respective share prices of Andeavor common stock and MPC common stock to ensure that the award holders’ economic opportunity remained constant, and for converted awards, which included a performance component, performance was determined at the time of the conversion and the awards became subject to a time-based vesting only design. The converted awards otherwise continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of their award agreements and the applicable Andeavor plan under which such awards were granted.\nStock-Based Awards under the Plans\nWe expense all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.\nStock Options\nWe grant stock options to certain officer and non-officer employees. All of the stock options granted in 2020 were granted under the MPC 2012 Plan. Stock options awarded under the MPC 2011 Plan and the MPC 2012 Plan represent the right to purchase shares of our common stock at its fair market value, which is the closing price of MPC’s common stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a maximum term of\nten years\nfrom the date they are granted, and vest over a requisite service period of\nthree years\n. We use the Black Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nWe grant restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees and non-employee directors. In general, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to employees vest over a requisite service period of\nthree years\n. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted to officers are subject to an additional\none year\nholding period after the three-year vesting period. Restricted stock recipients have the right to vote such stock; however, dividends are accrued and when vested are payable at the dates specified in the awards. The non-vested shares are not transferable and are held by our transfer agent. The fair values of restricted stock are equal to the market price of our common stock on the grant date. Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors are considered to vest immediately at the time of the grant for accounting purposes, as they are non-forfeitable, but are not issued until the director’s departure from the board of directors. Restricted stock unit recipients do not have the right to vote any shares of stock and accrue dividend equivalents which when vested are payable at the dates specified in the awards.\n151\nPerformance Units\nWe grant performance unit awards to certain officer employees. Performance units are dollar denominated. The target value of all performance units is $\n1.00\n, with actual payout up to $\n2.00\nper unit (up to\n200\npercent of target). Performance units issued under the MPC 2012 Plan have a\n36\n-month requisite service period. The payout value of these awards will be determined by the relative ranking of the total shareholder return (“TSR”\n)\nof MPC common stock compared to the TSR of a select group of peer companies, as well as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Energy Index fund over an average of four measurement periods. These awards will be settled\n25\npercent in MPC common stock and\n75\npercent in cash. The number of shares actually distributed will be determined by dividing 25 percent of the final payout by the closing price of MPC common stock on the day the Committee certifies the final TSR rankings, or the next trading day if the certification is made outside of normal trading hours. The performance units paying out in cash are accounted for as liability awards and recorded at fair value with a mark-to-market adjustment made each quarter. The performance units that settle in shares are accounted for as equity awards and do not receive dividend equivalents.\nTotal Stock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table reflects activity related to our stock-based compensation arrangements, including the converted awards related to the acquisition of Andeavor:\nStock Option Awards\nThe Black Scholes option-pricing model values used to value stock option awards granted were determined based on the following weighted average assumptions:\nThe expected life of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be held prior to exercise. The 2020 assumption for expected volatility of our stock price reflects a weighting of\n50\npercent of our common stock implied volatility and\n50\npercent of our common stock historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\n152\nThe following is a summary of our common stock option activity in 2020:\nThe intrinsic value of options exercised by MPC employees during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n25\nmillion, $\n23\nmillion and $\n44\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards was $\n15\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.8\nyears.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards\nThe following is a summary of restricted stock award activity of our common stock in 2020:\nThe following is a summary of the values related to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards held by MPC employees and non-employee directors:\nAs of December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards was $\n19\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.0\nyear. Unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock unit awards was $\n43\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.76\nyears.\n153\nPerformance Unit Awards\nThe following table presents a summary of the 2020 activity for performance unit awards to be settled in shares:\nThe number of shares that would be issued upon target vesting, using the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2020 would be\n320,661\nshares.\nAs of December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation cost related to equity-classified performance unit awards was $\n2\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.94\nyears.\nPerformance units to be settled in MPC shares have a grant date fair value calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. The following table provides a summary of these assumptions:\nThe risk-free interest rate for the remaining performance period as of the grant date is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The look-back period reflects the remaining performance period at the grant date. The assumption for the expected volatility of our stock price reflects the average MPC common stock historical volatility.\nMPLX Awards\nCompensation expense for awards of MPLX units are not material to our consolidated financial statements for 2020.\n28.    LEASES\nLessee\nWe lease a wide variety of facilities and equipment including land and building space, office and field equipment, storage facilities and transportation equipment. Our remaining lease terms range from less than\none year\nto\n58\nyears. Most long-term leases include renewal options ranging from less than\none year\nto\n49\nyears and, in certain leases, also include purchase options. The lease term included in the measurement of right of use assets and lease liabilities includes options to extend or terminate our leases that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\n154\nUnder ASC 842, the components of lease cost are shown below. Lease costs for operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis and are reflected in the income statement based on the leased asset’s use. Lease costs for finance leases are reflected in depreciation and amortization and in net interest and other financial costs.\nSupplemental balance sheet data related to leases were as follows:\n155\nAs of December 31, 2020, maturities of lease liabilities for operating lease obligations and finance lease obligations having initial or remaining non-cancellable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows:\nLessor\nMPLX has certain natural gas gathering, transportation and processing agreements in which it is considered to be the lessor under several operating lease arrangements in accordance with GAAP. MPLX’s primary natural gas lease operations relate to a natural gas gathering agreement in the Marcellus Shale for which it earns a fixed-fee for providing gathering services to a single producer using a dedicated gathering system. As the gathering system is expanded, the fixed-fee charged to the producer is adjusted to include the additional gathering assets in the lease. The primary term of the natural gas gathering arrangement expires in 2038 and will continue thereafter on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party. Other significant natural gas implicit leases relate to a natural gas processing agreement in the Marcellus Shale and a natural gas processing agreement in the Southern Appalachia region for which MPLX earns minimum monthly fees for providing processing services to a single producer using a dedicated processing plant. The primary term of these natural gas processing agreements expires during 2027 and 2023, respectively, and will continue thereafter on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party.\nMPLX did not elect to use the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for lessor arrangements. The tables below represent the portion of the contract allocated to the lease component based on relative standalone selling price. Lessor agreements are currently deemed operating, as MPLX elected the practical expedient to carry forward historical classification conclusions. If and when a modification of an existing agreement occurs and the agreement is required to assessed under ASC 842, MPLX assesses the amended agreement and makes a determination as to whether a reclassification of the lease is required.\nOur revenue from implicit lease arrangements, excluding executory costs, totaled approximately $\n273\nmillion and $\n254\nmillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Under ASC 840, our revenue from implicit lease arrangements, excluding executory costs, totaled approximately $\n221\nmillion in 2018.\nThe following is a schedule of minimum future rentals on the non‑cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2020:\n156\nThe following schedule summarizes our investment in assets held for operating lease by major classes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n29.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Some of these matters are discussed below.\nFor matters for which we have not recorded a liability, we are unable to estimate a range of possible loss because the issues involved have not been fully developed through pleadings, discovery or court proceedings\n. However, the ultimate resolution of some of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites and certain other locations including presently or formerly owned or operated retail marketing sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued liabilities for remediation totaled $\n397\nmillion and $\n396\nmillion, respectively. It is not presently possible to estimate the ultimate amount of all remediation costs that might be incurred or the penalties, if any, that may be imposed. Receivables for recoverable costs from certain states, under programs to assist companies in clean-up efforts related to underground storage tanks at presently or formerly owned or operated retail marketing sites, were $\n7\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGovernmental and other entities in various states have filed lawsuits against energy companies, including MPC. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. We are currently subject to such proceedings in federal or state courts in California, Delaware, Maryland, Hawaii, Rhode Island and South Carolina. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. At this early stage, the ultimate outcome of these matters remain uncertain, and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability, if any, can be determined.\nWe are involved in a number of environmental enforcement matters arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the resolution of these environmental matters will not, individually or collectively, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur short-term asset retirement obligations were $\n14\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our long-term asset retirement obligations were $\n183\nmillion and $\n184\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in deferred credits and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\n157\nOther Legal Proceedings\nIn early July 2020, MPLX received a Notification of Trespass Determination from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (“BIA”) relating to a portion of the Tesoro High Plains Pipeline (“THPP”), which crosses the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. The notification covered the rights of way for 23 tracts of land and demanded the immediate cessation of pipeline operations. The notification also assessed trespass damages of approximately $\n187\nmillion. MPLX appealed this determination, which triggered an automatic stay of the requested pipeline shutdown and payment. On October 29, the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs issued an order vacating the BIA’s trespass order and requiring the Regional Director for the BIA Great Plains Region to issue a new decision on or before December 15 covering all 34 tracts at issue. On December 15, the Regional Director of the BIA issued a new trespass notice to THPP consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs order vacating the prior trespass order. The new order found that THPP was in trespass and assessed trespass damages of approximately $\n4\nmillion (including interest), which has been paid. The order also required THPP to immediately cease and desist use of the portion of the pipeline that crosses the property at issue. THPP has complied with the Regional Director’s December 15, 2020 notice. On February 12, 2021, landowners filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota, requesting, among other things, that decisions by the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs and the Interior Board of Indian Appeals be vacated as to the award of damages to plaintiffs.\nMPLX continues to work towards a settlement of this matter with holders of the property rights at issue. Management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe are also a party to a number of other lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these other lawsuits and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nGuarantees\nWe have provided certain guarantees, direct and indirect, of the indebtedness of other companies. Under the terms of most of these guarantee arrangements, we would be required to perform should the guaranteed party fail to fulfill its obligations under the specified arrangements. In addition to these financial guarantees, we also have various performance guarantees related to specific agreements.\nGuarantees related to indebtedness of equity method investees\nLOOP and LOCAP\nMPC and MPLX hold interests in an offshore oil port, LOOP, and MPLX holds an interest in a crude oil pipeline system, LOCAP. Both LOOP and LOCAP have secured various project financings with throughput and deficiency agreements. Under the agreements, MPC, as a shipper, is required to advance funds if the investees are unable to service their debt. Any such advances are considered prepayments of future transportation charges. The duration of the agreements varies but tend to follow the terms of the underlying debt, which extend through 2037. Our maximum potential undiscounted payments under these agreements for the debt principal totaled $\n171\nmillion as of December 31, 2020.\nDakota Access Pipeline\nIn connection with MPLX’s approximate\n9.19\npercent indirect interest in a joint venture (“Dakota Access”) that owns and operates the Dakota Access Pipeline and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system or DAPL, MPLX entered into a Contingent Equity Contribution Agreement. MPLX, along with the other joint venture owners in the Bakken Pipeline system, has agreed to make equity contributions to the joint venture upon certain events occurring to allow the entities that own and operate the Bakken Pipeline system to satisfy their senior note payment obligations. The senior notes were issued to repay amounts owed by the pipeline companies to fund the cost of construction of the Bakken Pipeline system.\nIn March 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (the “D.D.C.”) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Army Corps”), which granted permits and an easement for the Bakken Pipeline system, to conduct a full environmental impact statement (“EIS”), and further requested briefing on whether an easement necessary for the operation of the Bakken Pipeline system should be vacated while the EIS is being prepared.\n158\nOn July 6, 2020, the D.D.C. ordered vacatur of the easement to cross Lake Oahe during the pendency of an EIS and further ordered a shut down of the pipeline by August 5, 2020. The D.D.C. denied a motion to stay that order. Dakota Access and the Army Corps appealed the D.D.C.’s orders to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”). On July 14, 2020, the Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay while the court considered Dakota Access and the Army Corps’ emergency motion for stay pending appeal. On August 5, 2020, the Court of Appeals stayed the D.D.C.’s injunction that required the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil by August 5, 2020. The Court of Appeals denied a stay of the D.D.C.’s March order, which required the EIS, and further denied a stay of the D.D.C.’s July order, which vacated the easement. On January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals upheld the D.D.C.’s order vacating the easement while the Army Corps prepares the EIS. The Court of Appeals reversed the D.D.C.’s order to the extent it directed that the pipeline be shutdown and emptied of oil. In the D.D.C., briefing has been completed for a renewed request for an injunction. The pipeline remains operational.\nIf the pipeline is temporarily shut down pending completion of the EIS, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of funds required to pay interest accruing on the notes and any portion of the principal that matures while the pipeline is shutdown. It is expected that MPLX would contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of any costs to remediate any deficiencies to reinstate the permit and/or return the pipeline into operation. If the vacatur of the easement permit results in a permanent shutdown of the pipeline, MPLX would have to contribute its 9.19 percent pro rata share of the cost to redeem the bonds (including the one percent redemption premium required pursuant to the indenture governing the notes) and any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under the Contingent Equity Contribution Agreement were approximately $\n230\nmillion.\nCrowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners\nIn connection with our 50 percent ownership in Crowley Ocean Partners, we have agreed to conditionally guarantee our portion of the obligations of the joint venture and its subsidiaries under a senior secured term loan agreement. The term loan agreement provides for loans of up to $\n325\nmillion to finance the acquisition of four product tankers. MPC’s liability under the guarantee for each vessel is conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events, including if we cease to maintain an investment grade credit rating or the charter for the relevant product tanker ceases to be in effect and is not replaced by a charter with an investment grade company on certain defined commercial terms. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under this agreement for debt principal totaled $\n119\nmillion.\nIn connection with our\n50\npercent indirect interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners, we have agreed to provide a conditional guarantee of up to\n50\npercent of its outstanding debt balance in the event there is no charter agreement in place with an investment grade customer for the entity’s three vessels as well as other financial support in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum potential undiscounted payments under this arrangement was $\n115\nmillion.\nMarathon Oil indemnifications\nThe separation and distribution agreement and other agreements with Marathon Oil to effect our spinoff provide for cross-indemnities between Marathon Oil and us. In general, Marathon Oil is required to indemnify us for any liabilities relating to Marathon Oil’s historical oil and gas exploration and production operations, oil sands mining operations and integrated gas operations, and we are required to indemnify Marathon Oil for any liabilities relating to Marathon Oil’s historical refining, marketing and transportation operations. The terms of these indemnifications are indefinite and the amounts are not capped.\nOther guarantees\nWe have entered into other guarantees with maximum potential undiscounted payments totaling $\n99\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, which primarily consist of a commitment to contribute cash to an equity method investee for certain catastrophic events, in lieu of procuring insurance coverage, a commitment to fund a share of the bonds issued by a government entity for construction of public utilities in the event that other industrial users of the facility default on their utility payments and leases of assets containing general lease indemnities and guaranteed residual values.\nGeneral guarantees associated with dispositions\nOver the years, we have sold various assets in the normal course of our business. Certain of the related agreements contain performance and general guarantees, including guarantees regarding inaccuracies in representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, and environmental and general indemnifications that require us to perform upon the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. These guarantees and\n159\nindemnifications are part of the normal course of selling assets. We are typically not able to calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be made under such contractual provisions because of the variability inherent in the guarantees and indemnities. Most often, the nature of the guarantees and indemnities is such that there is no appropriate method for quantifying the exposure because the underlying triggering event has little or no past experience upon which a reasonable prediction of the outcome can be based.\nContractual Commitments and Contingencies\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our contractual commitments to acquire property, plant and equipment and advance funds to equity method investees totaled $\n1.7\nbillion and $\n1.6\nbillion, respectively.\nCertain natural gas processing and gathering arrangements require us to construct natural gas processing plants, natural gas gathering pipelines and NGL pipelines and contain certain fees and charges if specified construction milestones are not achieved for reasons other than force majeure. In certain cases, certain producer customers may have the right to cancel the processing arrangements if there are significant delays that are not due to force majeure.\n160\nSELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)\nAs a result of the agreement to sell Speedway, Speedway’s results are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented.\nPrior to presentation of Speedway as discontinued operations, Speedway and our retained direct dealer business were the two reporting units within our Retail segment. Beginning with the third quarter of 2020, the direct dealer business is managed as part of the Refining & Marketing segment. The results of the Refining & Marketing segment have been retrospectively adjusted to include the results of the direct dealer business in all periods presented.\nIn accordance with ASC 205, Discontinued Operations, intersegment sales from our Refining & Marketing segment to Speedway are no longer eliminated as intercompany transactions and are now presented within sales and other operating revenue, since we will continue to supply fuel to Speedway subsequent to the sale to 7-Eleven. All periods presented have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this change.\n(a)\nThe sum of the per-share amounts for the four quarters may not always equal the annual per-share amounts due to differences in the average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods\n.\n161"
