At December 31, 2020, we operated 185 hospitals, comprised of 178 general, acute care hospitals; five psychiatric hospitals; and two rehabilitation hospitals. In addition, we operated 121 freestanding surgery centers and 21 freestanding endoscopy centers. Our facilities are located in 20 states and England.\nThe terms “Company,” “HCA,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its affiliates. The term “affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA, and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.\nOur primary objective is to provide a comprehensive array of quality health care services in the most cost-effective manner possible. Our general, acute care hospitals typically provide a full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care services are provided by our general, acute care hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities,\nwalk-in\nclinics, diagnostic centers and rehabilitation facilities. Our psychiatric hospitals provide a full range of mental health care services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.\nOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol “HCA”). Through our predecessors, we commenced operations in 1968. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 2010.

We strive to be the provider system of choice in the communities we serve and to support our operations with unique enterprise capabilities and best in class economies of scale. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:\nHealth Care Facilities\nWe currently own, manage or operate hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities,\nwalk-in\nclinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 178 general, acute care hospitals with 48,492 licensed beds. Most of our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up of members of the local community.\nAt December 31, 2020, we operated five psychiatric hospitals with 593 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs, including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care and adolescent and adult alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.\nWe also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities,\nwalk-in\nclinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA.\nCertain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient safety programs, ethics and compliance programs, national supply contracts, equipment purchasing and leasing contracts, accounting, financial and clinical systems, governmental reimbursement assistance, construction planning and coordination, information technology systems and solutions, legal counsel, human resources services and internal audit services.\nCOVID-19\nPandemic and CARES Act Funding\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated\nCOVID-19\nas a global pandemic. Patient volumes and the related revenues for most of our services were significantly impacted during the latter portion of the first quarter and the first half of the second quarter of 2020 and have continued to be impacted as various policies that were implemented by federal, state and local governments in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic,\n4\nincluding policies that have caused many people to remain at home, forced the closure of or limitations on certain businesses, and suspended elective surgical procedures by health care facilities. While many of these restrictions have been eased across the U.S. and most states have lifted moratoriums on\nnon-emergent\nprocedures, restrictions remain in place or may be adopted or\nre-imposed,\nand the possibility exists that the public, particularly segments with a high mortality risk, could remain wary of real or perceived opportunities for exposure to the virus. We are unable to predict the future impact of the pandemic on our operations.\nDuring 2020, we received approximately $4.4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments and approximately $1.8 billion in general and targeted distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, both as provided for and established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. During October 2020,\nwe announced our decision to return, or repay early, all of our share of the Provider Relief Fund distributions and all of the Medicare accelerated payments. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we returned, or repaid early, approximately $6.1 billion of these funds.\nWe believe the extent of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic’s impact on our operating results and financial condition has been and will continue to be driven by many factors, most of which are beyond our control and ability to forecast. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases in the areas in which we operate, the rollout and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines, the efficacy of public health controls, including vaccines, and the impact of any mutations of the virus; the scope and duration of\nstay-at-home\npractices and business closures and restrictions; recommended or required suspensions of elective procedures; continued declines in patient volumes for an indeterminable length of time; increases in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients as a result of higher sustained rates of unemployment; incremental expenses required for supplies and personal protective equipment (“PPE”); and changes in professional and general liability exposure. Because of these and other uncertainties, we cannot estimate how long or how severely the pandemic will impact our business. If we experience declines in cash flows and results of operations, such declines could have an impact on the inputs and assumptions used in significant accounting estimates, including estimated implicit price concessions related to uninsured patient accounts, professional and general liability reserves, and potential impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets.\nSummary Risk Factors\nYou should carefully read and consider the risk factors set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” as well as all other information contained in this annual report on Form\n10-K.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties:\nRisks related to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic and other potential pandemics:\n5\nRisks related to our indebtedness:\nRisks related to governmental regulation and other legal matters:\nRisks related to human capital:\nRisks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity:\n6\nRisks related to operations, strategy, demand and competition:\nRisks related to macroeconomic conditions:\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock:\nSources of Revenue\nHospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment rates for such services. Reimbursement rates for inpatient and outpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of third-party payer, the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.\n7\nWe receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges (“Exchanges”)), private insurers and directly from patients. Our revenues by primary third-party payer classification and other (including uninsured patients) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\nMedicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with\nend-stage\nrenal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services provided.\nOur hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private health insurers, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans, including health plans offered through the Exchanges. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.” For services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, patients are generally responsible for any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from government health care programs or other third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or for financial relief under our charity care policy. We may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.\nMedicare\nIn addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. In 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) began imposing a 2.0% reduction on Medicare payments. The CARES Act temporarily suspended these reductions through December 31, 2020 and extended the reductions through 2030. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”) further extended the suspension through March 31, 2021.\nInpatient Acute Care\nUnder the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per\n8\ninpatient discharge are established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group\n(“MS-DRG”).\nMS-DRGs\nclassify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis.\nMS-DRG\nweights represent the average resources for a given\nMS-DRG\nrelative to the average resources for all\nMS-DRGs.\nMS-DRG\npayments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on\nMS-DRG\nweights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional “outlier” payments. These payments are financed by offsetting reductions in the inpatient PPS rates. A high-cost outlier threshold is set annually at a level that will result in estimated outlier payments equaling 5.1% of total inpatient PPS payments for the fiscal year.\nMS-DRG\nrates are updated, and\nMS-DRG\nweights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the\nMS-DRG\nrates (the “market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. Each federal fiscal year, the annual market basket update is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”)\n10-year\nmoving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity, as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”). A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFor federal fiscal year 2020, CMS increased the\nMS-DRG\nrate by approximately 3.1%. This increase reflected a market basket update of 3.0%, adjusted by the following percentage points: a negative 0.4 productivity adjustment and a positive 0.5 adjustment in accordance with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”). For federal fiscal year 2021, CMS increased the\nMS-DRG\nrate by approximately 2.9%. This increase reflects a market basket update of 2.4%, adjusted by a positive 0.5 adjustment required by MACRA. Additional adjustments may apply, depending on patient-specific or hospital-specific factors. For example, the two midnight rule limits payments to hospitals when services to Medicare beneficiaries are payable as inpatient services. In addition, under the post-acute care transfer policy, Medicare reimbursement rates may be reduced when an inpatient hospital discharges a patient in a specified\nMS-DRG\nto certain post-acute care settings.\nCMS has implemented and is implementing a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals that do not successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program are subject to a 25% reduction of the market basket update. Hospitals that do not demonstrate meaningful use of electronic health records (“EHRs”) are subject to a 75% reduction of the market basket update.\nMedicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying\nMS-DRG\nif certain designated hospital acquired conditions (“HACs”) were not present on admission and the identified HAC is the only condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying\nMS-DRG.\nIn this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments. CMS has also established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis.\nPayments to hospitals may also be reduced based on readmission rates. Each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” readmissions within the\n30-day\ntime period from the date of discharge for conditions designated by CMS. For federal fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years, CMS has designated six conditions or procedures, including heart attack, pneumonia and total hip arthroplasty. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions or procedures receive reduced payments for\n9\nall inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions or procedures subject to the excess readmission standard. The amount by which payments are reduced is determined by assessing a hospital’s performance relative to hospitals with similar proportions of dual eligible patients, subject to a cap established by CMS. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital’s base payments. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.\nIn addition, CMS reduces the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by 2.0%. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled and used to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Because the Affordable Care Act provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored on a number of individual measures that are categorized into four domains: clinical outcomes; efficiency and cost reduction; safety; and person and community engagement. CMS estimates that $1.9 billion will be available to hospitals as incentive payments in federal fiscal year 2021 under the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program.\nOutpatient\nCMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities. In addition, certain items and services furnished by\noff-campus\nprovider-based departments, subject to certain exceptions, are not covered as outpatient department services under the outpatient PPS, but are reimbursed under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“Physician Fee Schedule”), subject to adjustments as specified by CMS. In calendar year 2019, CMS began a\ntwo-year\nphase-in\nof an expanded site-neutral policy under which clinic visit services provided at all\noff-campus\nprovider-based departments are reimbursed at the Physician Fee Schedule rate, which is generally lower than the PPS rate. Previously, this rate did not apply to “excepted” provider-based departments. In September 2019, a federal judge invalidated the expansion of the site-neutral payment policy for 2019. CMS appealed this decision and won, but had begun reprocessing the 2019 claims paid at the lower rates. For calendar year 2020, CMS issued a final rule implementing year two of the policy\nphase-in.\nFor calendar year 2021 and beyond, CMS is continuing the payment policy. CMS is considering how to address reprocessed claims from this litigation. In conjunction with these efforts aimed at increasing site neutrality, CMS also finalized a rule in December 2020 that will begin phasing out over three years the Inpatient Only List, which is a list of procedures eligible to be reimbursed by Medicare only if performed in an inpatient setting. As a result, these procedures will also be eligible to be reimbursed by Medicare if performed in outpatient settings.\nHospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. The APC payment rates are updated for each calendar year. Each calendar year, the annual market basket update is further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS\n10-year\nmoving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity as required by the Affordable Care Act. For calendar year 2020, CMS increased APC payment rates by an estimated 2.6%. This increase reflected a market basket increase of 3.0% with a negative 0.4 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2021, CMS increased APC payment rates by an estimated 2.4%. This increase reflects a market basket increase of 2.4%. Together with other policy changes, CMS estimates that the calendar year 2021 rates will increase Medicare outpatient PPS payments by 2.4%. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction in the annual payment update under the outpatient PPS.\n10\nThe 340B program allows participating hospitals to purchase certain outpatient drugs from manufacturers at discounted rates. These hospitals are reimbursed for the discounted drugs under the same Medicare payment methodology and rates as are applied to\nnon-340B-discounted\ndrugs. In a final rule effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) reduced the Medicare payments under the outpatient PPS for most drugs obtained at the 340B-discounted rates. This payment policy has been heavily litigated. In 2020, HHS prevailed at the circuit court level, with the court upholding its authority to implement this policy. Depending upon the remedy and the outcome of any appeal, this case could result in a decrease to the Company’s outpatient Medicare reimbursement. For calendar year 2021, HHS will continue to pay the reduced rates that took effect beginning in 2018.\nRehabilitation\nCMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups that reflect the relative resource intensity typically associated with the patient’s clinical condition. The case mix groups are based upon impairment, age, functional motor and cognitive scores, and comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers). IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the patient’s case mix group that is adjusted for facility-specific factors, such as area wage levels, proportion of\nlow-income\npatients, and location in a rural area. Each federal fiscal year, the IRF rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS\n10-year\nmoving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2020, CMS increased IRF payment rates by an estimated 2.5%, reflecting an IRF market basket update of 2.9% with a negative 0.4 percentage point productivity adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2021, CMS increased IRF payment rates by an estimated 2.4%, reflecting an IRF market basket update of 2.4%. In addition, CMS requires IRFs to report quality measures to avoid receiving a reduction of 2.0 percentage points to the market basket update. CMS has indicated that it is working toward a unified payment system for post-acute care services, including those provided by IRFs.\nIn order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent\n12-month\nCMS-defined\nreview period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to\npre-admission\nscreenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under either the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2020, we had two rehabilitation hospitals and 66 hospital rehabilitation units.\nPsychiatric\nInpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis. The inpatient psychiatric facility (“IPF”) PPS is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. Each federal fiscal year, IPF payment rates are updated using a market basket index, which is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS\n10-year\nmoving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2020, CMS increased IPF payment rates by an estimated 1.75%, which reflects a 2.9% IPF market basket update with a negative 0.4 percentage point productivity adjustment and a negative 0.75 percentage point adjustment required by law. For federal fiscal year 2021, CMS increased IPF payment rates by an estimated 2.2%, which reflects a 2.2% IPF market basket increase. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS to avoid receiving a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2020, we had five psychiatric hospitals and 50 hospital psychiatric units.\n11\nAmbulatory Surgery Centers\nCMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS expands the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be moved to physicians’ offices. Some commercial third-party payers have adopted similar policies.\nHistorically, CMS updated reimbursement rates for ASCs based on changes to the consumer price index. However, for calendar years through 2023, CMS updates to ASC reimbursement rates will be based on the hospital market basket index, partly to promote site-neutrality between hospitals and ASCs. For each federal fiscal year, the ASC payment system update is reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS\n10-year\nmoving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2020, CMS increased ASC payment rates by 2.6%, which reflected a market basket increase of 3.0% and a negative 0.4 percentage point productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2021, CMS increased ASC payment rates by 2.4%, which reflects a market basket increase of 2.4%. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures receive a 2.0 percentage point reduction to the consumer price index update.\nPhysician Services\nPhysician services are reimbursed under the Physician Fee Schedule system, under which CMS has assigned a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services, relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments made under the Physician Fee Schedule may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made. CMS annually reviews resource inputs for select services as part of the potentially misvalued code initiative. To determine the payment rate for a particular service, the sum of the geographically adjusted RVUs is multiplied by a conversion factor. For 2021, CMS updated the conversion factor based on a budget neutrality adjustment of negative 10.20%. However, the CAA provides for a 3.75% payment increase under the Physician Fee Schedule, which will partially offset this reduction.\nMedicare payments are adjusted based on participation in the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Physicians and certain other health care clinicians are required to participate in one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in each performance year will affect Medicare payments two years later. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. Providers may earn a 5% Medicare incentive payment through 2024 and will be exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) if the provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM. Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track. Currently, providers electing this option may receive payment incentives or be subject to payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality,\n12\nresource use, clinical improvement activities, and meeting Promoting Interoperability standards related to the meaningful use of EHRs. Performance data collected in 2021 will result in payment adjustments of up to 9% in 2023. CMS will continue to offer the Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy for 2021 performance data. This policy is an exception providers must apply for, which allows reweighting for any or all MIPS performance categories for providers impacted by the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. MIPS consolidates components of three previously established physician incentive programs: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier, and the Medicare EHR Incentive Program.\nOther\nUnder PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for area differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”) reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and taking into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes is not anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2021.\nMedicare reimburses hospitals for a portion (65%) of deductible and coinsurance amounts that are uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries.\nCMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are geographically assigned across 12 jurisdictions to service both Part A and Part B providers. While providers with operations across multiple geographies had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, we chose, in most cases, to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically\nre-solicits\nbids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flows.\nCMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through reviews of quality concerns and detections, and corrections of improper payments. Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”), for example, are groups of physicians and other health care quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary, and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the\nfee-for-service\nMedicare program. The compensation for RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity, and the amount of overpayments and underpayments they identify. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each provider’s claim denial rate for the previous year. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis and expanded the RAC program to the Managed Medicare program and Medicare Part D. CMS is transitioning some of its other integrity programs to a consolidated model by engaging Unified Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”) to perform audits, investigations and other integrity activities.\nWe have established policies and procedures to respond to requests from and payment denials by RACs and other Medicare contractors. Payment recoveries resulting from reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We incur additional costs related to responding to requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. Currently, there are significant delays in the Medicare appeals process. Depending upon changes to and the growth of the RAC program and other Medicare integrity programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nMedicare reimburses teaching hospitals for portions of the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education (“GME”) through statutory formulas that are generally based on the number of medical residents and\n13\nwhich take into account patient volume or the number of hospital beds. Accrediting organizations review GME programs for compliance with educational standards. Many of our hospitals operate GME or other residency programs to train physicians and other allied health professionals.\nManaged Medicare\nUnder the Managed Medicare program (also known as Medicare Part C, or Medicare Advantage), the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private\nfee-for-service\nplans. In addition to covering Part A and Part B benefits, the health insurers may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and plan costs on beneficiaries. CMS makes fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings and publishes star ratings to assist beneficiaries with plan selection. According to CMS, over\none-third\nof all Medicare enrollees participate in managed Medicare plans.\nMedicaid\nMedicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. The Affordable Care Act requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. Previously, certain members of Congress and the prior presidential administration indicated their intent to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including allowing states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement. However, President Biden has issued executive orders directing agencies to re-examine measures that reduce coverage or undermine Medicaid programs, including work requirements.\nBecause most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Certain states in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the\nnon-federal\nshare of Medicaid programs. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems.\nFederal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state.\nCongress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs UPICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims, identify overpayments, and perform other program integrity activities, many of which were previously performed by Medicaid Integrity Contractors. The UPICs collaborate with states and coordinate provider investigations across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, state Medicaid agencies are required to establish Medicaid RAC programs. These programs vary by state in design and operation.\n14\nManaged Medicaid\nEnrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one or more of the designated entities, usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific. Many states direct managed care plans to pass through supplemental payments to designated providers, independent of services rendered, to ensure consistent funding of providers that serve large numbers of\nlow-income\npatients. However, in an effort to more closely tie funds to delivery and outcomes, CMS began limiting these “pass-through payments” to managed Medicaid plans in 2016 and will ultimately prohibit such payments by 2027.\nAccountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives\nAn Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) is a network of providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which was established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, and the Next Generation ACO Model.\nThe Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, while improving quality of care. For example, providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. The CMMI has implemented bundled payment models, including the Bundled Payment Care Improvement Advanced (“BPCI Advanced”) program, which is voluntary and expected to run through December 2023. Participation in bundled payment programs is generally voluntary, but CMS has required providers in selected geographic areas to participate in a mandatory bundled program for specified orthopedic procedures, which is scheduled to run through September 30, 2021. CMS will require hospitals in selected markets to participate in bundled payment initiatives for end-stage renal disease treatment, which began January 1, 2021, and radiation oncology, beginning as early as January 1, 2022. HHS has indicated that it plans to implement additional bundled payment programs, some of which will be mandatory.\nHHS continues to focus on shifting from traditional\nfee-for-service\nreimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and/or value, including bundled payment and\npay-for-performance\nprograms. Several private third-party payers are increasingly employing such reimbursement models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to providers.\nDisproportionate Share Hospital and Medicaid Supplemental Payments\nIn addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of\nlow-income\npatients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payment adjustments are determined annually based on certain statistical information required by HHS and are paid as a percentage addition to\nMS-DRG\npayments. CMS also distributes a payment to each DSH hospital that is allocated according to the hospital’s proportion of uncompensated care costs relative to the uncompensated care amount of other DSH hospitals.\n15\nSome states make additional payments to providers through the Medicaid program for certain specific claims. These supplemental payments may be in the form of Medicaid DSH payments, which help to offset hospital uncompensated care costs, or upper payment limit supplemental payments, which are intended to address the difference between Medicaid\nfee-for-service\npayments and Medicare reimbursement rates. CMS is considering changes to both types of payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation provide for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program. Under the budget bill signed into law in February 2018, Medicaid DSH payments would have been reduced by $4 billion in 2020 and by $8 billion per year from 2021 through 2025. However, Congress has delayed the implementation of these reductions through 2023, but added additional reductions for 2026 and 2027.\nTRICARE\nTRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.\nAnnual Cost Reports\nAll hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.\nAnnual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports.\nManaged Care and Other Discounted Plans\nMost of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services, including managed care plans and private health insurers. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 29%, 28% and 28% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases of approximately 4% from managed care payers during 2020, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. Price transparency initiatives may impact our ability to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms. Effective January 1, 2022, the No Surprises Act (enacted as part of the CAA) will require providers to send to a patient’s health plan good faith estimates of the expected charges for furnishing scheduled items or services, including any item or service that is reasonably expected to be provided in conjunction with the scheduled item or service or that is reasonably expected to be delivered by another provider, before the services are delivered. The No Surprises Act will also prohibit providers from charging patients an amount beyond the\nin-network\ncost sharing amount for services rendered by\nout-of-network\nproviders, subject to limited exceptions. It is not clear what impact, if any, these or future health reform efforts at the federal and state levels, consolidation within the third-party payer industry and vertical integration among third-party payers and health care providers will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement rates.\n16\nUninsured and\nSelf-Pay\nPatients\nSelf-pay\nrevenues are derived from providing health care services to patients without health insurance coverage and from the patient responsibility portion of payments for our health care services that are not covered by an individual’s health plan. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government health care programs or private third-party payers. Any increases in uninsured individuals, changes to the payer mix or greater adoption of health plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts could increase amounts due from individuals. Effective January 1, 2022, the No Surprises Act will require providers to send uninsured patients a good faith estimate of the expected charges for furnishing scheduled items or services, including any item or service that is reasonably expected to be provided in conjunction with the scheduled item or service or that is reasonably expected to be delivered by another provider, before the services are delivered. If the actual charges are substantially higher than the estimate, the patient can invoke a dispute resolution process to challenge the higher amount.\nA high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 87% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. In addition, health insurers are required to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place.\n17\nHospital Utilization\nWe believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local population, local economic conditions and market penetration of managed care programs.\nThe following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold weather months.\n18\nCompetition\nGenerally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. Additionally, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate continues to increase. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing facilities are more established than our hospitals. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by\ntax-supported\ngovernment agencies and many others are owned by\nnot-for-profit\nentities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals and may provide the\ntax-supported\nor\nnot-for-profit\nentities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services. Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric hospitals and units compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.\nTrends toward clinical and pricing transparency may impact our competitive position in ways that are difficult to predict. For example, hospitals are currently required to publish online a list of their standard charges for items and services. In 2019, CMS issued a final rule that, beginning January 2021, requires hospitals to publish additional types of standard charges for all items and services, including discounted cash prices and payer-specific and\nde-identified\nnegotiated charges, in a publicly accessible online file. Hospitals are also required to publish a consumer-friendly list of charges for certain “shoppable” services (i.e., services that can be scheduled by a patient in advance) and associated ancillary services. Court challenges to the 2019 rule in both the District Court for the District of Columbia and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals were unsuccessful. It is not yet known whether the Biden administration will take any action regarding the rule or whether the matter will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. CMS plans to begin auditing hospitals for compliance with transparency requirements and may impose civil monetary penalties for noncompliance. In addition, the No Surprises Act creates additional price transparency requirements beginning on January 1, 2022, including the requirement that providers send patients and health plans a good faith estimate of the expected charges and diagnostic codes prior to a patient’s appointment.\nOur strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology offered, and quality and condition of the facilities. We focus on operating outpatient services with accessibility and convenient service for patients and predictability and efficiency for physicians.\nTwo of the most significant factors that impact the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models.\nAnother major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals is our ability to negotiate service contracts with group purchasers of health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges. Similarly, employers and\n19\ntraditional health insurers continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group purchasers of health care services on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our contracts with third-party payers and enter into new contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into contracts with third-party payers or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Price transparency initiatives and increasing vertical integration efforts involving third-party payers and health care providers, among other factors, may increase these challenges. Moreover, the trend toward consolidation among private third-party payers tends to increase payer bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, health reform efforts, such as the Affordable Care Act’s limitations on rescissions of coverage and\npre-existing\ncondition exclusions, may lead to private third-party payers increasingly demanding reduced fees or being unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Health plans increasingly utilize narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. These trends may continue regardless of potential repeal or replacement of, or changes to, the Affordable Care Act, or other health reform efforts. The importance of obtaining contracts with group purchasers of health care services varies from community to community, depending on the market strength of such organizations.\nState certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place limitations on a health care facility’s ability to expand services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional, changes in, or expanded health care facilities or services. Removal of these requirements could reduce barriers to entry and increase competition in our service areas. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”\nWe and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and contracting for provider services by third-party payers remain ongoing challenges.\nAdmissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by third-party payer\npre-admission\nauthorization requirements, utilization review and pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and third-party payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or construct new facilities where appropriate, enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to group purchasers of health care services, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and services.\nRegulation and Other Factors\nLicensure, Certification and Accreditation\nHealth care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting, building codes and environmental protection. Facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the\n20\nvarious standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws. Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs and is accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal health care programs. From time to time, we may acquire a facility that is not accredited but for which we will seek accreditation. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from private third-party payers. Management believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change, and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties.\nCertificates of Need\nIn some states where we operate hospitals and other health care providers, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership, capital expenditures and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services or other change. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or expenditure or change ownership or other penalties.\nState Rate Review\nSome states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating such reviews.\nFederal Health Care Program Regulations\nParticipation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital or other provider fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the provider’s participation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed. Civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index and were increased under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.\nAnti-kickback Statute\nA section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-\n21\nkickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines of up to $100,000 per violation, imprisonment, substantial civil monetary penalties per violation that are subject to annual adjustment based on updates to the consumer price index and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) as a false or fraudulent claim.\nThe HHS Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”), among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods, including advisory opinions and “Special Fraud Alerts.” These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a physician’s office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder,\n(f) low-interest\nor interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences or payments to a physician for speaking engagements, (h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which physicians refer, and (l) physician-owned entities (frequently referred to as physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having information about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.\nThe OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a means of providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to the physician’s efforts.\nIn addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.\nAs authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, referral agreements for specialty services, care coordination arrangements, arrangements for patient engagement and support,\n22\nCMS-sponsored\nmodel arrangements, cybersecurity technology and related services, and value-based arrangements.\nThe fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.\nWe have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.\nAlthough we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs.\nStark Law\nThe Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide certain “designated health services” reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, substantial civil monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty for a circumvention scheme. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.\nThere are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases, recruitment agreements and personal service arrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law. Although there is an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Affordable Care Act prohibits physician-owned hospitals established after December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the Affordable Care Act grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.\nThrough a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how\n23\nthe government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and are subject to continuing legal and regulatory change. We cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.\nSimilar State Laws\nMany states in which we operate also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. These state laws often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure.\nOther Fraud and Abuse Provisions\nCertain federal fraud and abuse laws apply to all health benefit programs and provide for criminal penalties. The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any business entities and any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual for an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports.\nSome of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Substantial civil monetary penalties may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result in penalties of up to three times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program.\nThe Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws\nWe are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit the making of false claims or statements. One of the most prominent of these laws is the FCA, which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a\nqui tam\nplaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government’s behalf. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. In\n24\naddition, the FCA covers payments made in connection with the Exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, if those payments include any federal funds. When a private party brings a\nqui tam\naction under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus substantial mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. These penalties are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.\nThere are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create liability. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. Whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. False claims under the FCA also include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.\nEvery entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws.\nHIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy, Security and Interoperability Requirements\nThe Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry.\nThe privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.\nCovered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All\nnon-permitted\nuses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information.\n25\nViolations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. These civil penalties are updated annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS enforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. We enforce compliance in accordance with HIPAA privacy and security regulations. The Information Protection and Security Department monitors our compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. The HIPAA privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards.\nThere are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) affords consumers expanded privacy protections effective January 1, 2020. Moreover, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) takes effect January 1, 2022, and significantly modifies the CCPA. The potential effects of these laws\nare far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. For example, the CCPA and CPRA give California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.\nHealth care providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. For example, beginning April 5, 2021, health care providers and certain other entities will be subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the 21\nst\nCentury Cures Act that prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other disincentives.\nMany foreign data privacy regulations (including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”)) are more stringent than those in the United States. In the case of\nnon-compliance\nwith a material provision of the GDPR (such as\nnon-adherence\nto the core principles of processing personal data), regulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. If it is determined that\nnon-compliance\nis related to a\nnon-material\nprovision (such as failure to comply with technical measures), regulators may impose a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €10 million or 2% of the global annual turnover from the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach.\nEMTALA\nAll of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These civil monetary penalties are\n26\nadjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.\nThe government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a patient’s pending arrival in a\nnon-hospital\nowned ambulance. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively.\nCorporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting\nSome of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities from employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments to, or entering into\nfee-splitting\narrangements with, health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.\nHealth Care Industry Investigations\nSignificant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.\nOur substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards.\nBecause the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our practices or industry practices.\nIn public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations.\nBoth federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. The Affordable Care Act included additional federal funding of $350 million over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse, which expired in 2020. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.\n27\nIn addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices for\nself-pay\npatients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity.\nHealth Care Reform\nThe health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences, along with various scientific and technological initiatives. In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. health care system, including the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. For example, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. A number of members of Congress have stated their desire to repeal or make additional significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or interpretation. Effective January 1, 2019, the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance was eliminated. As a result of this change, in December 2018, the United States District Court for the North District of Texas found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional and determined that the rest of the Affordable Care Act was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. On November 10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding this case, and the law remains in place pending the appeals process. The elimination of the individual mandate penalty and other changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased.\nAs currently structured, the Affordable Care Act expands coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance requirements, public program expansion and other reforms. Expansion of coverage through the private sector has been driven by requirements applicable to health insurers, employers, and individuals. For example, health insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon\npre-existing\nconditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage. Expansion in public program coverage has been driven primarily by expanding the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permitting individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. For states that have not participated in the Medicaid expansion, the maximum income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state. Some states are using waivers granted by CMS to expand their Medicaid programs, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. In addition, some states are proposing or have implemented various health reform initiatives at the state level. For example, some states have proposed public health insurance options, and some states have passed or are considering legislation to address\nout-of-network\nbilling.\nThe Affordable Care Act has had a net positive effect on the Company to date, before considering the impact of Medicare reductions that began in 2010, and it is expected that the law, as presently implemented, will\n28\ncontinue to have a positive contribution to the Company’s results of operations. However, there is uncertainty regarding the ongoing net effect of the Affordable Care Act due to efforts to change, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act, court challenges, and the development of agency guidance, among other factors. There is also uncertainty regarding the potential impact of other reform efforts at the federal and state levels. For example, some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including proposals to expand coverage of federally-funded insurance programs as an alternative to private insurance or establish a single-payer system (such reforms often referred to as “Medicare for All”), and some states are considering similar measures. Further, the impact of the 2020 federal election on health reform efforts is unknown, although President Biden has indicated through executive orders that his administration intends to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid programs. Other initiatives and proposals, including those aimed at price transparency and\nout-of-network\ncharges, may impact prices and the relationships between health care providers and insurers. These issues are further discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nGeneral Economic and Demographic Factors\nThe health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has led, and may continue to lead, to a general worsening of economic conditions. Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals and other providers. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures and the aging of the United States population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and increased difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts.\nCompliance Program\nWe maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or to the Company’s ethics line available 24 hours a day by phone and internet portal.\nAntitrust Laws\nThe federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation,\nbid-rigging,\nconcerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations.\n29\nInsurance\nAs is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business. Subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related claim. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.\nWe purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for cyber security incidents, directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate and subject to terms of coverage we believe to be reasonable.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur workforce is comprised of approximately 275,000 employees (as of December 31, 2020), including approximately 80,000 part-time employees (references herein to “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates). Our Board of Directors and its committees oversee human capital matters through regular reporting from management and advisors.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion that embraces and supports our patients, colleagues, partners, physicians and communities. Our workforce is comprised of approximately 80% women and 41% people of color. Our policies prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, color, ancestry, citizenship, religion, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, payment source or ability, or any other basis prohibited by federal, state or local law.\nWe are dedicated to being an employer of choice. We seek to recruit diverse candidates at all stages of their careers and through a variety of venues and programs. We recently launched a data-driven diversity, equity and inclusion strategy based on internal and external research to support the advancement of women and people of color into leadership roles. We also partner with national organizations which promote diversity in leadership positions. Our Chief Diversity Officer leads a 20-person team that is responsible for advancing diversity, inclusion, equity and cultural competence initiatives across the Company.\nWe encourage you to review the “Inclusion, Compassion and Respect” section of our website, as well as the “Excellent People Make Excellence Happen” section of our 2020 Impact Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our diversity, equity, inclusion and pay equity programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website, including our 2020 Impact Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by location) include an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, health care and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, tuition and student loan assistance and on-site services, such as cafeterias and fitness centers, among many others.\nServing the Community\nWe provide our colleagues with opportunities to learn, serve, lead and give in their communities. By joining forces with other leading organizations, we maximize our ability to provide care for patients and populations.\n30\nThrough research, partnerships, policies and investments, we are tackling problems in our communities, from disaster relief to environmental sustainability. We also support the HCA Healthcare Foundation, whose mission is to promote health and well-being and strive to make a positive impact in all the communities HCA Healthcare serves by providing leadership, service and financial support to effective non-profit organizations.\nCulture and Talent Development\nHCA Healthcare’s culture is critical to our success. We seek to instill a culture across our system that includes making a positive impact on our patients, communities and each other. We seek to nurture a collaborative culture built on inclusion, compassion and respect.\nTo assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we conduct colleague pulse surveys and take action to address areas of concern. During 2020, we hosted routine surveys as well as an innovative pandemic survey to gauge the pulse of our teams as we pivoted to respond to the needs of our communities during the pandemic.\nWe also seek to support our colleagues throughout their career journey, providing education, training, and opportunities to grow as clinicians and leaders. We also support our colleagues’ development through programs such as tuition reimbursement, clinical training and certification, loan forgiveness and award-winning programs offered through the HCA Healthcare Leadership Institute.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nWe provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes to address the interests of our patients, employees, medical staff members and contractors, as well as the communities in which we operate, such as providing PPE, COVID-19 screening for patients and certain hospital staff, and scrub laundering. During 2020:\nLabor Matters\nWe are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2020, certain employees at 37 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor unions. Two elections were held in January 2020 that resulted in the addition of a number of employees to existing bargaining units at one of our facilities in California and one facility in Missouri. During September 2020, an election was held that resulted in the creation of a new bargaining unit at one of our facilities in North Carolina, and a decertification election was held that resulted in the elimination of a bargaining unit at a facility in Virginia. While no other elections are scheduled in 2021, it is possible that employees at additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. However, it is possible that a material work stoppage at one or more of our hospitals may occur in the\n31\nfuture. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.\nOur hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.\nWe may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nAs of February 1, 2021, our executive officers were as follows:\nSamuel N.

    "text": "If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. Our business is subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.\nRisks related to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic and other potential pandemics:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\nis significantly affecting our operations, business and financial condition. Our liquidity could also be negatively impacted by the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant amount of time.\nOn January 31, 2020, HHS declared a national public health emergency (“PHE”) due to a novel coronavirus. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak\nof COVID-19,\na disease caused by this novel coronavirus, a pandemic. This disease continues to spread throughout the United States and other parts of the world.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\nis significantly affecting our employees, patients, hospitals, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. As\nthe COVID-19 crisis\ncontinues to evolve, the full extent to which\nthe COVID-19 outbreak\nwill impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. For example, we are not able to predict or control the severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional periods of increases in the number of\nCOVID-19\ncases in areas in which we operate, the rollout and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines, the efficacy of public health controls, including vaccines, or the impact of any mutations of the virus. Florida and Texas, our two largest markets, have been and may in the future be “hot spots” of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. Due to the concentration of our hospitals in Texas and Florida, we are particularly sensitive to the increase in\nCOVID-19\ncases in those states where the pandemic could have a disproportionate effect on our business.\nWe have been working with federal, state and local health authorities to respond\nto COVID-19 cases\nin the markets we serve and continue to take and support measures to try to limit the spread of the virus and to mitigate\n35\nthe burden on the health care system. For example, we are subject to\nCOVID-19\ndata reporting requirements, and some states are requiring hospitals to maintain a reserve of PPE and mandating\nCOVID-19\nscreening for new patients and certain hospital staff. CMS has made\nCOVID-19\ndata reporting requirements a Medicare condition of participation for hospitals, such that noncompliance with these requirements could result in termination from the Medicare program. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to protecting the health and well-being and meeting the needs of our patients, employees, medical staff members and contractors, including pandemic pay programs, hoteling our staff and additional scrub laundering. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic. Further, our management is focused on mitigating the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise, which may impact our ability to properly prioritize and successfully execute on the Company’s other strategic initiatives.\nAs a front line provider of health care services, we have been and will continue to be impacted by the health and economic effects\nof COVID-19.\nAlthough we are implementing considerable safety measures, treatment\nof COVID-19 patients\nhas associated risks to our employees, patients and physicians. These risks, and how clinical staff perceive and respond to them, may adversely affect our operating capacity. Despite considerable efforts to source vital supplies, we have experienced and may continue to experience supply chain disruptions, including delays and price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly PPE, and we may experience shortages. Our current PPE inventory is satisfactory, but we cannot be certain that our supplies will remain sufficient in the future. In addition, restrictive measures taken to address the\nCOVID-19\npandemic may impact the availability of employed and contract labor staffing for corporate support services, including, but not limited to, coding, billing, collection and other business office functions, which could adversely affect our execution of established control procedures that may not be sufficiently mitigated through execution of our business continuity plans. Staffing, equipment, laboratory resources and pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may impact our ability to schedule, admit and treat patients. The\nCOVID-19\npandemic has also resulted in an increased number of early retirements in our workforce and resulted in fewer graduate nurses being able to enter the workforce. The combined impact of these factors, despite our efforts to mitigate their effect, could result in reduced employee morale and increased exposure to labor unrest, work stoppages or other workforce disruptions.\nRestrictions on elective procedures, travel bans, social distancing, quarantines and\nstay-at-home\nand\nshelter-in-place\norders, and other restrictive measures have reduced, and may in the future reduce, the volume of procedures performed at our facilities, as well as the volume of emergency room and physician office visits unrelated\nto COVID-19.\nIn the last two weeks of March 2020 and in the second quarter of 2020, we cancelled a substantial amount of elective procedures at our facilities and closed or reduced operating hours at a significant number of our surgery centers that specialize in elective procedures, resulting in significantly reduced patient volumes and operating revenues. We may continue to cancel elective procedures and close or reduce operating hours at our facilities in the future. Some state and local governments are limiting hospital volume by requiring a minimum percentage of vacant beds in case of a surge in\nCOVID-19\npatients. Although some social contact restrictions have eased across the U.S. and most states have lifted moratoriums on\nnon-emergent\nprocedures, some restrictions remain in place. Further closings and restrictions on hours and services may be imposed or\nre-imposed\nfor an unpredictable amount of time in connection with increasing or fluctuating\nCOVID-19\ncases. We are currently selectively suspending elective procedures at certain facilities based upon local\nCOVID-19\nvolume trends, bed capacity and staffing levels. It is unclear whether certain markets, such as Florida and Texas, will continue to experience periods of increases or spikes in the number of\nCOVID-19\ncases. During the second half of 2020, we believe\nCOVID-19\ncases at our hospitals contributed to an increase in patient acuity and led to an increase in reimbursements. However, the impacts of\nCOVID-19\nin future periods may vary, could exert unpredictable and potentially negative effects on clinical performance metrics that impact reimbursement levels and could adversely affect our results of operations.\n36\nSome individuals may choose to postpone medical care (including long-term care) for an undetermined period of time even in the absence of government or industry-adopted restrictions. At this time, we believe that certain of the patient volume declines we are experiencing reflect a deferral of health care services utilization to a later period, rather than a permanent reduction in demand for our services; however, we cannot provide assurances as to the recovery\nof pre-pandemic patient\nvolumes or the ultimate impact on demand. Further, our patient volumes may be adversely impacted by the expanded use of telehealth services from other providers as a result of reduced regulatory barriers on the use and reimbursement of telehealth services and individuals becoming more comfortable with receiving remote care. The Company may not be able to timely innovate its strategies and technologies to meet changing consumer demands as a result of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic.\nBroad economic factors resulting from the\ncurrent COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding high unemployment and underemployment rates and reduced consumer spending and confidence, also affect our service mix, revenue mix, payer mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and layoffs in the areas where we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital. In addition, our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal, state or local laws, regulations, orders, or other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the\ncurrent COVID-19 pandemic\nor the U.S. health care system, which could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may also be subject to claims from patients, employees and others exposed\nto COVID-19 at\nour facilities. Such actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs, though there is no certainty at this time whether any such claims will be filed or the outcome of such claims if filed. Our professional and general liability insurance, a portion of which is provided through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary, may not cover all claims against us.\nIf general economic conditions continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, the\ncurrent COVID-19 pandemic\nmay cause disruption in the financial markets and banking industry. These factors may affect the availability, terms or timing on which we may obtain any additional funding and our ability to access our cash. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic\ncould heighten the risks in certain of the other risk factors described in this annual report on\nForm 10-K,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nThere is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and other existing or future stimulus legislation, if any. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial assistance or types of assistance we will receive, that we will be able to comply with the applicable terms and conditions to retain such assistance, that we will be able to benefit from provisions intended to increase access to resources and ease regulatory burdens for health care providers or that additional stimulus legislation will be enacted.\nThe CARES Act is a $2 trillion economic stimulus package signed into law on March 27, 2020, in response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn an effort to stabilize the U.S. economy, the CARES Act provides for cash payments to individuals and loans and grants to small businesses, among other measures. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement (“PPPHCE”) Act and the CAA, both expansions of the CARES Act that include additional emergency appropriations, were signed into law on April 24, 2020 and December 27, 2020, respectively. In total, the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, and the CAA authorize $178 billion in funding to be distributed to hospitals and other health care providers through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (“PHSSEF”), also known as the Provider Relief Fund. These funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers and suppliers for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues attributable\nto COVID-19.\n37\nRecipients are not required to repay PHSSEF funds, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including limitations on balance billing and not using PHSSEF funds to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse. HHS allocated $50 billion of the CARES Act provider relief funding for general distribution to Medicare providers impacted\nby COVID-19,\nto be distributed proportional to providers’ share of 2018 net patient revenue. HHS distributed $18 billion to eligible Medicaid and CHIP providers that did not receive a payment from the general distribution allocation and $14.4 billion to safety net hospitals. In addition, HHS has made targeted distributions for providers in areas particularly impacted by\nCOVID-19,\nrural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, and providers requesting reimbursement for treatment of uninsured Americans, among others. A portion of the available funding is being distributed to reimburse health care providers that submit claims requests for\nCOVID-19-related treatment\nof uninsured patients at Medicare rates. HHS has not yet announced the precise method by which all future payments from the PHSSEF will be determined or allocated, so the potential impact to us is not currently known.\nThe CARES Act also makes other forms of financial assistance available to health care providers, including Medicare and Medicaid payment adjustments and an expansion of the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, which makes available advance payments of Medicare funds in order to increase cash flow to providers. CMS is no longer accepting applications from hospitals and other Medicare Part A providers for accelerated payments and has suspended the advance payment program for physicians and other Medicare Part B providers. Recoupment of accelerated payments was due to begin in August 2020, but CMS has delayed the recoupment process for these payments, based on amended repayment terms imposed by the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act, enacted October 1, 2020, until one year after payment was issued. However, repayments can be made at any time.\nDuring 2020, we received approximately $4.4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments and approximately $1.8 billion in general and targeted distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, both as provided for and established under the CARES Act. During October 2020,\nwe announced our decision to return, or repay early, all of our share of the Provider Relief Fund distributions and all of the Medicare accelerated payments. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we returned, or repaid early, approximately $6.1 billion of these funds.\nIn addition to financial assistance, the CARES Act and related legislation include provisions intended to increase access to medical supplies and equipment and ease financial, legal and regulatory burdens on health care providers. For example, the CARES Act, the CAA and related legislation suspend the Medicare sequestration payment adjustment from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 (but extend sequestration through 2030), provide for a 20%\nadd-on\npayment under the hospital inpatient PPS for care provided to patients with\nCOVID-19,\nexpand access to and payment for telehealth services under Medicare, prioritize review of drug applications to help with shortages of emergency drugs, delay Medicaid DSH reductions, and provide funding to reimburse providers for conducting\nCOVID-19\ntesting for the uninsured. HHS and CMS have announced other flexibilities for health care providers in response to\nCOVID-19,\nsuch as extensions for and relief from data submission requirements for providers participating in certain quality reporting programs. It is unclear how changes to these and other value-based programs will affect our financial condition.\nDue to the recent enactment of the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act, the CAA and other enacted legislation, there is still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding their implementation, and the\nCOVID-19\npandemic continues to evolve. Some of the measures allowing for flexibility in delivery of care and various financial supports for health care providers are available only for the duration of the PHE, and it is unclear whether or for how long the PHE declaration will be extended. The current PHE determination expires April 21, 2021. The HHS Secretary may choose to renew the PHE declaration for successive\n90-day\nperiods for as long as the emergency continues to exist and may terminate the declaration whenever he determines that the PHE no longer exists. The federal government may consider additional stimulus and relief efforts, but we are unable to predict whether additional stimulus measures will be enacted or their impact. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial and other types of assistance we will receive under the CARES Act, PPPHCE Act, the CAA or future\n38\nlegislation, if any, or whether we shall retain, return or repay any future assistance, and it is difficult to predict the impact of such legislation on our operations. Further, there can be no assurance that the terms and conditions of provider relief funding or other relief programs will not change or be interpreted in ways that affect our ability to comply with such terms and conditions in the future (which could affect our ability or willingness to retain assistance), the amount of total stimulus funding we will receive or our eligibility to participate in such stimulus funding. For time periods prior to returning Provider Relief Funds, with respect to future assistance, if any, we do not return, and in those cases where our partners retain such assistance, we will continue to monitor our compliance with the terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund, including demonstrating that the distributions received have been used for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to\nCOVID-19.\nIf we are unable to attest to or comply with current or future terms and conditions with respect to any assistance not voluntarily returned for our less-than-wholly owned partnerships, our ability to retain some or all of the distributions received may be impacted. We will continue to assess the potential impact\nof COVID-19 and\ngovernment responses to the pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe emergence and effects related to a potential future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could adversely affect our operations.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in health care facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities, and our reputation may be negatively affected. Patient volumes may decline or volumes of uninsured and underinsured patients may increase, depending on the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or causing staffing shortages in our facilities. We have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak, as well as the public’s and the government’s response to the pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak, is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.\nRisks related to our indebtedness:\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was $31.004 billion. As of December 31, 2020, we had availability of $1.962 billion under our senior secured revolving credit facility, $3.750 billion under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base limitations and $2.000 billion under our senior secured\n364-day\nterm loan facility (which was terminated during January 2021). Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, some of which may be exacerbated by the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, including:\n39\nWe and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, interest rates and the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, including the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nWe may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be favorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then current global economic and financial conditions which affect the availability of debt financing and the rates at which such financing is available. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:\n40\nUnder our asset-based revolving credit facility, borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable less customary reserves, with any reduction in the borrowing base commensurately reducing our ability to access this facility as a source of liquidity. In addition, under the asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.\nUnder our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant portion of our other outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that collateral is also pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $3.671 billion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities that bore interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR and $7.712 billion of unfunded commitments under those facilities. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration, in its capacity as administrator of LIBOR, has published a consultation regarding its intention to continue publication of certain LIBOR tenors by 18 months to June 2023. Notwithstanding this possible extension, a joint statement by key regulatory authorities called on banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and it is impossible to predict whether LIBOR rates will continue to be published or supported after the end of 2021. If LIBOR becomes unavailable, the interest rate applicable to our floating rate debt will be calculated based on an alternative, comparable or successor rate, which may have a material adverse impact on the cost of the floating rate portion of our indebtedness. The timing and result of the phase out of LIBOR are unclear, and efforts of industry groups to develop a suitable successor are not guaranteed to result in a viable or widely adopted replacement for LIBOR. If LIBOR becomes unavailable before a suitable replacement is widely adopted, it could have a material adverse impact on the availability of floating rate financing.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we also had $2.500 billion of interest rate swap agreements based on LIBOR. If LIBOR becomes unavailable, it is unclear how payments under those agreements would be calculated. The\n41\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association has published a standard protocol addressing the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, but there can be no assurance that such a protocol will be implemented with respect to our swap agreements.\nRisks related to governmental regulation and other legal matters:\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by health care reform efforts, including court challenges to, and efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise significantly change the Affordable Care Act. We are unable to predict what, if any, and when such changes will be made in the future.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. health care system, including the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. For example, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. A number of members of Congress have stated their desire to repeal or make additional significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or interpretation. Effective January 1, 2019, the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance was eliminated. As a result of this change, in December 2018, the United States District Court for the North District of Texas found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional and determined that the rest of the Affordable Care Act was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. On November 10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding this case, and the law remains in place pending the appeals process. The elimination of the individual mandate penalty and other changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the Affordable Care Act may be further changed, the ultimate outcome of court challenges and how the law will be interpreted and implemented. Changes by Congress or government agencies could eliminate or alter provisions beneficial to us, while leaving in place provisions reducing our reimbursement or otherwise negatively impacting our business. There is also uncertainty regarding whether, when, and what other health reform initiatives will be adopted and the impact of such efforts on providers and other health care industry participants. Further, the potential impact of the 2020 federal election on health reform efforts is unknown. Some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including proposals to expand coverage of federally-funded insurance programs as an alternative to private insurance or establish a single-payer system (such reforms often referred to as “Medicare for All”), and some states are considering similar measures. CMS has indicated that it intends to increase flexibility in state Medicaid programs, including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may implement Medicaid expansion provisions, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. CMS administrators have also signaled interest in changing Medicaid payment models. Other health reform initiatives and proposals, such as the limitations and prohibitions on surprise billing imposed by the No Surprises Act, enacted as part of the CAA, may impact prices, our relationships with patients, payers or ancillary providers (such as anesthesiologists, radiologists, and pathologists), and our competitive position. Other industry participants, such as private payers and large employer groups and their affiliates, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms. We are unable to predict the nature and success of such initiatives. Health care reform initiatives, including changes to or repeal or invalidation of the Affordable Care Act, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources, and liquidity.\n42\nChanges in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.\nA significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 42.7% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2020. Changes in government health care programs, including Medicaid waiver programs, may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The Affordable Care Act has made significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid, and future health reform efforts or further efforts to repeal or significantly change the Affordable Care Act may impact these programs.\nIn recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. Congress has established automatic spending reductions that extend through 2030. However, the percentage reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. While this reduction has been suspended by the CARES Act and related legislation, it is scheduled to be reinstated April 1, 2021. We are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Affordable Care Act and other laws. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the\nMS-DRG\nsystem and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. For example, CMS plans to use data that hospitals are required to report to CMS for cost reports ending on or after January 1, 2021 regarding their median negotiated charges by\nMS-DRG\nfor Medicare Advantage payers to determine\nMS-DRG\nrelative weights beginning in 2024. We cannot predict how this change might impact Medicare payment in the future, but the scope and magnitude have the potential to be material to our business. Further, under a site neutrality policy, clinic visit services provided by\noff-campus\nprovider-based departments that were formerly paid under the outpatient PPS are now paid under the Physician Fee Schedule, subject to certain exceptions that were phased out through calendar years 2019 and 2020. CMS has also issued final rules reducing Medicare payment rates under the outpatient PPS for drugs obtained under the 340B Drug Pricing Program. CMS is also considering proposals to reduce drug costs such as the most-favored nation drug pricing model that would align payment for the 50 Medicare Part B drugs with the highest expenditures to the payment amounts for those drugs in international markets. CMS may implement further changes to how items or services are reimbursed that result in payment reductions for other services.\nBecause most states must operate with balanced budgets and the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs,\ndis-enroll\nMedicaid recipients who fail to meet work requirements and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures may result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, and CMS has performed and continues to perform compliance reviews of some states’ programs and is considering changes to the requirements for such programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. Further, legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may significantly alter the funding for, or structure of, the Medicaid program. For example, from time to time, Congress considers proposals to restructure the Medicaid program to involve block grants that would be administered by the states. CMS has announced its intent to introduce additional flexibilities for Medicaid program operation, including block grants and increased use of value-based care models.\nIn some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.\n43\nCurrent or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes by private third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:\nAmong these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law, the FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.\n44\nOur financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex and are subject to continuing legal and regulatory change. Thus, we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.\nAdditionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a\nqui tam\n, or “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”\nWe also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.\nA variety of state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. For example, the CCPA, which affords consumers expanded privacy protections such as the right to know what personal information is collected and how it is used, went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was recently significantly amended by the CPRA, which will go into effect on January 1, 2022. California residents also have the right to request that a business delete their personal information unless it is necessary for the business to maintain for certain purposes, to direct a business to correct errors in their personal information, and to restrict the use and disclosure of sensitive information. They have the right to know if their personal information is being sold or shared and the right to\nopt-out\nof the sale or disclosure. Failure to comply with the CCPA and CPRA may result in regulator enforcement action and damage to our reputation. The CPRA creates a new regulator responsible for enforcement of the CPRA, and enforcement priorities of this new regulatory body have yet to be determined. The CCPA and CPRA also provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. The potential effects of this legislation are\nfar-reaching\nand may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. The GDPR contains stricter privacy restrictions than laws and regulations in the United States and provides for significant fines in the event of violations. These administrative fines are based on a multi-factored approach. Moreover, rules for data transfers outside of the United Kingdom and European Economic Area have changed significantly with Brexit and a recent Court of European Justice decision, and are subject to further revision and updated regulator guidance, making necessary compliance measures challenging to ascertain and implement with respect to our United Kingdom operations. We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions, which could impact our operations and cause us to incur substantial costs.\nWe send short message service, or SMS, text messages to patients. While we obtain consent from these individuals to send text messages, federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants may claim that the notices and disclosures we provide, form of consents we obtain or our SMS texting practices are not adequate or violate applicable law. In addition, we must ensure that our SMS texting practices comply with regulations and agency guidance under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”), a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls, faxes and text messages. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with the TCPA, the Federal Communications Commission, as the agency that implements and enforces the TCPA, may disagree with our interpretation of the TCPA and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our SMS texting practices violate the TCPA could subject us to civil penalties and could require us to change some portions of our\n45\nbusiness. Even an unsuccessful challenge by patients or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.\nWe engage in consumer debt collection for HCA-affiliated hospitals and certain non-affiliated hospitals. We also engage in credit reporting for certain non-affiliated hospitals. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the TCPA restrict the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts and to report to consumer reporting agencies on the status of those accounts. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection and credit reporting practices, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, which are subject to change, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, money damages, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems and/or result in a patient volume decline. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.\nWe do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendments to, these or other laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these or other laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these or other laws, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.\nState efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.\nSome states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. The failure to obtain any required CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may incur additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to tax in the United States as well as those states and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Changes in tax laws, including increases in tax rates, or interpretations of tax laws by taxing authorities or other standard setting bodies could increase our tax obligations and have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are also subject to examination by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid\n46\ntaxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nWe have been and could become the subject of government investigations, claims and litigation.\nHealth care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various government agencies. Further, under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring\nqui tam\n, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities and/or affiliates have received, and other facilities and/or affiliates may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nGovernment agencies and their agents, such as the MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. CMS and state Medicaid agencies contract with RACs and other contractors on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, including managed Medicare plans, and the Medicaid programs. RAC denials are appealable; however, there are currently significant delays in the Medicare appeals process, which negatively impacts our ability to appeal RAC payment denials. Private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nShould we be found out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.\nWe are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our professional liability risks through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our 100% owned insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to human capital:\nOur labor costs may be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and labor union activity.\nOur operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with\n47\nother health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers. The\nCOVID-19\npandemic has exacerbated workforce competition and shortages. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. If there is additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to offset these increased costs as a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management.\nThe talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. In addition, institutional knowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.\nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.\nThe success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. We continue to face increasing competition to recruit physicians. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We may face increased challenges in this area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable services. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.\nRisks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity:\nWe may not be reimbursed for the cost of expensive, new technology.\nAs health care technology continues to advance, the price of purchasing such new technology has significantly increased for providers. Some payers have not adapted their payment systems to adequately cover the cost of these technologies for providers and patients. If payers do not adequately reimburse us for these new technologies, we may be unable to acquire such technologies or we may nevertheless determine to acquire or utilize these technologies in order to treat our patients. In either case, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\n48\nA cybersecurity incident could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential data or critical data systems. A cybersecurity incident could also give rise to potential harm to patients; remediation and other expenses; and exposure to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws. Such incidents could subject us to litigation and foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe, directly and through third-party vendors, collect and store on our networks and devices sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients and employees. We have made significant investments in technology to adopt and meaningfully use EHR and in the use of medical devices that store sensitive data and are integral to the provision of patient care. In addition, medical devices manufactured by third parties that are used within our facilities are increasingly connected to the internet, hospital networks and other medical devices. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems and devices against us or our third-party vendors create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware and phishing incidents. The volume and intensity of cyberattacks on hospitals and health systems continues to increase. We are regularly the target of attempted cybersecurity and other threats that could have a security impact, and we expect to continue to experience an increase in cybersecurity threats in the future. There can be no assurance that we or our third-party vendors will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to provide various health care services. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our facilities, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, along with their increased volume and sophistication, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security, breach notification and consumer protection laws, common law theories or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage; and (vi) foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nOur operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.\nThe performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:\n49\nInformation systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. We have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. Nevertheless, we or our third-party vendors that we rely upon may experience system failures. The occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nHealth care technology initiatives, particularly those related to patient data and interoperability, may adversely affect our operations.\nThe federal government is working to promote the adoption of health information technology and the promotion of nationwide health information exchange to improve health care. For example, HHS incentivizes the adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology through its Promoting Interoperability Programs. Eligible hospitals and eligible professionals, including our hospitals and employed professionals, are subject to reduced payments from Medicare if they fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. As these technologies have become widespread, the focus has shifted to increasing patient access to health care data and interoperability. The 21\nst\nCentury Cures Act prohibits information blocking by health care providers and certain other entities, which is defined as engaging in activities likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Current and future initiatives related to health care technology and interoperability may require changes to our operations, impose new and complex compliance obligations and require investments in infrastructure. We may be subject to financial penalties or other disincentives or experience reputational damage for failure to comply. It is difficult to predict how these initiatives will affect our relationships with providers and vendors, participation in health care information exchanges or networks, the exchange of patient data, and patient engagement.\nRisks related to operations, strategy, demand and competition:\nOur hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.\nThe health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. The Hospital Compare website provides an overall rating that synthesizes various quality measures into a single star rating for each hospital. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Further, hospitals are currently required by law to publish online a list of their standard charges for items and services. A CMS final rule implements expanded transparency requirements beginning in 2021. The rule was recently upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is unclear whether the final rule will be subject to further court challenges or other changes under the Biden administration. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are higher or are perceived to be higher than our competitors, our competitive position could be negatively affected.\nThe number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased. Many individuals are seeking a broader range of services at outpatient facilities as a result of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient health care facilities, the increase in payer reimbursement policies that restrict inpatient coverage and the increase in the services that can be provided on an outpatient basis, including high margin services. Consequently, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment, which may put pressure on our pricing, ability to contract with third-party payers and the Company’s strategy for volume growth. Some of the\n50\nfacilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or\nnot-for-profit\ncorporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a\ntax-exempt\nbasis. Recent consolidations of\nnot-for-profit\nhospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure. There is also increasing consolidation in the third-party payer industry, including vertical integration efforts among third-party payers and health care providers, and increasing efforts by payers to influence or direct the patient’s choice of provider by the use of narrow networks or other strategies. Health care industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. Other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, may intensify competitive pressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict.\nOur hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs and other outpatient providers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs and other outpatient providers are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our providers. In states that do not require a CON or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Some states that have historically imposed CON or similar prior approval requirements have removed or are considering removing these requirements, which may reduce barriers to entry and increase competition in our service areas. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable third-party payer contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and other providers, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”\nA deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary third-party payer has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. Medicare reimburses hospitals for 65% of eligible Medicare bad debts. To be eligible for reimbursement, the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria, including that the debt is related to unpaid deductible or coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted to collect the fees from the Medicare beneficiary.\nThe estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31, 2020, estimated implicit price concessions of $6.108 billion had been recorded to adjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the estimated amounts we expect to collect. The estimated cost of total uncompensated care was $3.483 billion for 2020, $3.733 billion for 2019 and $3.318 billion for 2018.\nAny increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in total uncompensated care as a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and high unemployment, both of which have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted by the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate. Further, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. We are unable to predict what, if any, and when such changes will be made in the future.\n51\nWe provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals, including for those residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion or that modify the terms of the program, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance. Some patients may choose to enroll in lower cost Medicaid plans or other health insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of health plan structures that shift greater payment responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts.\nIf our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced.\nBroad economic factors resulting from the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, including increased unemployment rates and reduced consumer spending, the continued shift to an outpatient setting and the aging population may impact our revenue mix. Private third-party payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs. Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are\nin-network,\nand payers utilize plan structures to encourage or require the use of\nin-network\nproviders. Revenues derived from private third-party payers (domestic only) accounted for 51.5%, 51.6% and 52.4% of our revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a result, our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by private third-party payers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with private third-party payers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities.\nPrivate third-party payers, including managed care plans, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the ongoing trend toward consolidation among payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Payers may utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices or impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with us. In addition to increasing negotiating leverage of private third-party payers, alignment efforts between third-party payers and health care providers may result in other competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing data. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our third-party payer contracts and enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us, which may be impacted by price transparency initiatives. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates, such as directly contracting with a limited number of providers, may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure. It is not clear what impact, if any, future health reform efforts or the repeal of, or further changes to, the Affordable Care Act will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in third-party payer networks on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with third-party payers or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received from third-party payers, our revenues may be reduced.\nChanges to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies, third-party payer controls designed to reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues.\nControls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and private third-party payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to increasingly affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by third-party payers, and may involve prior authorization requirements. The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient\n52\nutilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by third-party payers’ preadmission authorization requirements, coverage restrictions, utilization review and by pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and health plan design, such as health plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies.\nVolume, admission and\ncase-mix\ntrends may be impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other illnesses, such as\nCOVID-19,\nand medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment regimens and medical technology and other advances. Further, the Medicare program’s three-year phase out and eventual elimination of the Inpatient Only List, a list of surgeries and procedures that are only covered by Medicare when provided in an inpatient setting, may reduce inpatient volumes. These factors may reduce the demand for services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, cost controls, changes to physician utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement rates and fees and other factors beyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses and challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.\nA component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or other facility, or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of\nnot-for-profit\nhospitals to\nfor-profit\nentities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of\nnot-for-profits\nunder their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the\nnon-profit\nseller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. Resolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.\nWe may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers’ compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the\npre-acquisition\nconduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.\n53\nOur facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.\nWe operated 185 hospitals at December 31, 2020, and 91 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented 49% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. This concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, public health, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.\nIn addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states are located in hurricane-prone areas. In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm, either of which may be intensified by climate change, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThere is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called “never events”). The Affordable Care Act also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. The 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments.\nHospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by HHS receive a reduction in their inpatient PPS operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital’s base payments.\nHHS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in each federal fiscal year. HHS pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS estimates that $1.9 billion in value-based incentive payments will be available to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2021 based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the hospital’s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise.\nCMS has developed several alternative payment models that are intended to reduce costs and improve quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries and has signaled its intent to have states apply similar strategies in the Medicaid context. Examples of alternative payment models include bundled payment models in which, depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. Generally, participation in bundled payment programs is voluntary, but CMS has required hospitals in selected markets to participate in a bundled payment initiative for specified orthopedic procedures, which is scheduled to run through September 30, 2021. CMS will require hospitals in selected markets to participate in bundled payment initiatives for end-stage renal disease treatment, which began January 1, 2021, and radiation oncology, beginning as early as January 1, 2022. CMS has indicated that it is developing more voluntary and mandatory bundled payment models. Participation in mandatory or voluntary demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect payment, may negatively impact our results of operations.\n54\nSome private third-party payers are also transitioning toward alternative payment models or implementing other value-based care strategies. For example, many large private third-party payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several private third-party payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. It is unclear whether these and other alternative payment models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease aggregate reimbursement. We are unable at this time to predict our future payments or whether we will be subject to payment reductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations. If we are unable to meet or exceed the quality performance standards under any applicable value-based purchasing program, perform at a level below the outcomes demonstrated by our competitors, or otherwise fail to effectively provide or coordinate the efficient delivery of quality health care services, our reputation in the industry may be negatively impacted, we may receive reduced reimbursement amounts and we may owe repayments to payers, causing our revenues to decline.\nRisks related to macroeconomic conditions:\nOur overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness.\nBudget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue to negatively impact spending for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant third-party payer sources for our hospitals. The\nCOVID-19\npandemic has led, and may continue to lead, to a general worsening of economic conditions. In addition, we anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures and the aging of the United States population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), which may lead to poorer health and higher acuity interventions, potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible receivables.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rates.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The\nCOVID-19\npandemic has increased volatility of the capital and credit markets and has led to a general worsening of economic conditions. The investments of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $504 million at December 31, 2020. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2020, we had a net unrealized gain of $32 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investment securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on long-term investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.\nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates that impact the amount of the interest expense we incur with respect to our floating rate obligations as well as the value of certain investments. We\n55\nperiodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock:\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.\nIn January 2018, the Board of Directors initiated a cash dividend program under which the Company commenced a regular quarterly cash dividend. However, in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, the Company took the precautionary step to enhance its financial flexibility by suspending its quarterly dividend program in the second quarter of 2020. In February 2021, the Board of Directors approved the resumption of the Company’s quarterly cash dividend program following evaluation of the Company’s financial position.\nThe declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash flows from operations, our available capital and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets as well as our results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nCertain of our investors may continue to have influence over us.\nOn November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and certain other investors. Through their investment in Hercules Holding II and other holdings, certain of the Frist-affiliated investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock (approximately 21% as of January 31, 2021). In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with Hercules Holding II and the Frist-affiliated investors, certain representatives of these investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of our Board of Directors. As a result, certain of these investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors and any transaction that requires stockholder approval."

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nCOVID-19\nPandemic and CARES Act Funding\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated\nCOVID-19\nas a global pandemic. Patient volumes and the related revenues for most of our services were significantly impacted during the latter portion of the first quarter and the first half of the second quarter of 2020 and have continued to be impacted as various policies that were implemented by federal, state and local governments in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, including policies that have caused many people to remain at home, forced the closure of or limitations on certain businesses, and suspended elective surgical procedures by health care facilities. While many of these restrictions have been eased across the U.S. and most states have lifted moratoriums on\nnon-emergent\nprocedures, restrictions remain in place or may be adopted or\nre-imposed,\nand the possibility exists that the public, particularly segments with a high mortality risk, could remain wary of real or perceived opportunities for exposure to the virus. We are unable to predict the future impact of the pandemic on our operations.\nDuring 2020, we received approximately $4.4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments and approximately $1.8 billion in general and targeted distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, both as provided for and established under the CARES Act. During October 2020,\nwe announced our decision to return, or repay early, all of our share of the Provider Relief Fund distributions and all of the Medicare accelerated payments. During the\n61\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nCOVID-19\nPandemic and CARES Act Funding (continued)\nfourth quarter of 2020, we returned, or repaid early, approximately $6.1 billion of these funds. The unreturned Provider Relief Funds of $83 million, related to amounts received by certain of our partnership entities, are recorded under the caption “other accrued expenses” in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. Our share of these funds will be returned in 2021 after final determination of amounts earned and distributable to the members of each respective partnership.\nWe believe the extent of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic’s impact on our operating results and financial condition has been and will continue to be driven by many factors, most of which are beyond our control and ability to forecast. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases in the areas in which we operate, the rollout and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines, the efficacy of public health controls, including vaccines, and the impact of any mutations of the virus; the scope and duration of\nstay-at-home\npractices and business closures and restrictions; recommended or required suspensions of elective procedures, continued declines in patient volumes for an indeterminable length of time; increases in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients as a result of higher sustained rates of unemployment; incremental expenses required for supplies and personal protective equipment; and changes in professional and general liability exposure. Because of these and other uncertainties, we cannot estimate how long or how severely the pandemic will impact our business. If we experience declines in cash flows and results of operations, such declines could have an impact on the inputs and assumptions used in significant accounting estimates, including estimated implicit price concessions related to uninsured patient accounts, professional and general liability reserves, and potential impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets.\n2020 Operations Summary\nNet income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $3.754 billion, or $10.93 per diluted share, for 2020, compared to $3.505 billion, or $10.07 per diluted share, for 2019. The 2020 results included $60 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, of employee retention payroll tax credits, as provided for by the CARES Act. The 2020 results also include losses on sales of facilities of $7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $295 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. The 2019 results include gains on sales of facilities of $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $211 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. Revenues for 2020 include $55 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, related to the settlement of Medicare outlier calculations for prior periods and $69 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to the resolution of transaction price differences regarding certain services performed in prior periods. Revenues for 2019 include $86 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the resolution of transaction price differences regarding certain services performed in prior periods. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $112 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, and $50 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, respectively. Our provisions for income taxes for 2020 and 2019 included tax benefits of $92 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, and $65 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 343.605 million shares and 348.226 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenues increased to $51.533 billion for 2020 from $51.336 billion for 2019. Revenues increased 0.4% and declined 0.1%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2020, compared to 2019. The consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the net impact of a 10.5% increase in revenue per equivalent admission offset by a 9.2% decline in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues decline\n62\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\n2020 Operations Summary (continued)\nresulted primarily from the net impact of a 9.3% decline in same facility equivalent admissions offset by a 10.1% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission.\nDuring 2020, consolidated admissions declined 4.7% and same facility admissions declined 4.8%, compared to 2019. Inpatient surgical volumes declined 7.8% on both a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis during 2020, compared to 2019. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 12.6% on a consolidated basis and declined 12.4% on a same facility basis during 2020, compared to 2019. Emergency room visits declined 18.7% on a consolidated basis and declined 18.8% on a same facility basis during 2020, compared to 2019.\nThe estimated cost of total uncompensated care declined $250 million for 2020, compared to 2019. Consolidated and same facility uninsured admissions both declined 7.0%, and consolidated and same facility uninsured emergency room visits declined 20.9% and 21.0%, respectively, for 2020, compared to 2019.\nInterest expense totaled $1.584 billion for 2020, compared to $1.824 billion for 2019. The $240 million decline in interest expense for 2020 was due to declines in both the average debt balance and the effective interest rate.\nCash flows from operating activities increased $1.630 billion, from $7.602 billion for 2019 to $9.232 billion for 2020. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, of $330 million and positive changes in working capital items of $1.366 billion, primarily from the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the collection of accounts receivable.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business and creating long-term value for our stockholders. We strive to be the provider system of choice in the communities we serve and to support our operations with unique enterprise capabilities and best in class economies of scale. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:\nGrow Our Presence in Existing Markets.\nWe believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and developing comprehensive service lines such as cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics and women’s services. Additional components of our growth strategy include providing access and convenience through developing various outpatient facilities, including, but not limited to surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities and imaging centers, as well as seeking to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets.\nAchieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical, Operational and Satisfaction Measures.\nAchieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business. To achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these initiatives will continue to improve\n63\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nBusiness Strategy (continued)\npatient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.\nRecruit and Employ Physicians to Meet the Needs for High Quality Health Services.\nWe depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. We believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.\nContinue to Leverage Our Scale and Market Positions to Grow the Company.\nWe believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our organization. We continue to invest in initiatives such as care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We continue to invest in our Parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.\nPursue a Disciplined Development Strategy.\nWe continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our\nin-market\nopportunities. To complement our\nin-market\ngrowth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. We believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may continue to spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues\nRevenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s\n64\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)\nRevenues (continued)\ninterpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.\nPatients treated at hospitals for\nnon-elective\ncare, who have income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, were eligible for charity care, and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income above 400% of the federal poverty level, were eligible for certain other discounts which limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. We apply additional discounts to limit patient responsibility for certain emergency services. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. We may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.\nDue to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. The adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year resulted in net increases to revenues of $70 million, $51 million and $29 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years resulted in a net reduction to revenues of $5 million in 2020 and net increases to revenues of $13 million and $51 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to Medicare and Medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in net increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.\nImplicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been performed. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly changes\n65\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)\nRevenues (continued)\nin estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or\nperiod-to-period\ncomparisons of our revenues. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, estimated implicit price concessions of $6.108 billion and $6.953 billion, respectively, had been recorded to adjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the estimated amounts we expect to collect.\nTo quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions. A summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions):\nManagement expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.\nProfessional Liability Claims\nWe, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. Our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of either $25 million or $35 million per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related claim. We purchase excess insurance on an occurrence reported basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $435 million, $497 million and $447 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $112 million, $50 million and $70 million, respectively, due to the receipt of updated actuarial information.\nReserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known\n66\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)\nProfessional Liability Claims (continued)\nclaims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate\n20-year\nperiod is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.\nReserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.710 billion to $2.050 billion at December 31, 2020 and $1.589 billion to $1.903 billion at December 31, 2019. Our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. A 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $26 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $25 million. A 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $126 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $116 million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.\nThe reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,300 individual claims at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an\noccurrence-to-resolution\ntimeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.\nReserves for professional liability risks were $1.963 billion and $1.827 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $477 million and $457 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of $39 million and $46 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) were $1.924 billion and $1.781 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are\n67\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)\nProfessional Liability Claims (continued)\ncomprised of $833 million and $695 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $1.091 billion and $1.086 billion, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.\nChanges in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods. Interest and penalties payable to taxing authorities are included as a component of our provision for income taxes. We have elected to treat taxes incurred on global intangible\nlow-taxed\nincome as a period expense.\nAlthough we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. Final audit results may vary from our estimates.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue/Volume Trends\nOur revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts\n68\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResults of Operations (continued)\nRevenue/Volume Trends (continued)\nrelated to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.\nRevenues increased 0.4% to $51.533 billion for 2020 from $51.336 billion for 2019 and increased 10.0% for 2019 from $46.677 billion for 2018. The increase in revenues in 2020 can be primarily attributed to the net impact of a 10.5% increase in revenue per equivalent admission offset by a 9.2% decline in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues in 2019 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 6.6% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year.\nSame facility revenues declined 0.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 and increased 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The 0.1% decline for 2020 can be primarily attributed to the net impact of a 9.3% decline in same facility equivalent admissions offset by a 10.1% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and. The 5.9% increase for 2019 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.\nConsolidated admissions declined 4.7% during 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 5.2% during 2019 compared to 2018. Consolidated surgeries declined 10.9% during 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 3.7% during 2019 compared to 2018. Consolidated emergency room visits declined 18.7% during 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 4.5% during 2019 compared to 2018.\nSame facility admissions declined 4.8% during 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 2.8% during 2019 compared to 2018. Same facility surgeries declined 10.7% during 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 1.4% during 2019 compared to 2018. Same facility emergency room visits declined 18.8% during 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 2.8% during 2019 compared to 2018.\nSame facility uninsured emergency room visits declined 21.0% and same facility uninsured admissions declined 7.0% during 2020 compared to 2019. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 3.9% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.7% during 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe approximate percentages of our admissions related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed care and insurers and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are set forth below.\n69\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResults of Operations (continued)\nRevenue/Volume Trends (continued)\nThe approximate percentages of our inpatient revenues related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, and managed care and insurers for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are set forth below.\nAt December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 31 surgery centers in the state of Florida. Our Florida facilities’ revenues totaled $11.442 billion, $11.494 billion and $10.892 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2020, we owned and operated 46 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled $13.528 billion, $13.101 billion and $12.023 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, 56%, 56% and 57% of our admissions and 49%, 48% and 49%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 72%, 72% and 70% of our uninsured admissions during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. In December 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) announced that it will phase out federal matching funds for Designated State Health Programs under waivers granted under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act. Texas currently operates its Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program pursuant to a Medicaid waiver. In December 2017, CMS approved an extension of this waiver through September 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out some of the federal funding. Our Texas Medicaid revenues included Medicaid supplemental waiver payments of $599 million, $416 million and $450 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. We are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by CMS and certain state agencies, and that some states have made waiver requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. It is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.\n70\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResults of Operations (continued)\nOperating Results Summary\nThe following are comparative summaries of operating results and certain operating data for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in millions):\n71\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResults of Operations (continued)\nOperating Results Summary (continued)\n72\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResults of Operations (continued)\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe present certain metrics and statistical information that management uses when assessing our results of operations. We believe this information is useful to investors as it provides insight to how management evaluates operational performance and trends between reporting periods. Information on how these metrics and statistical information are defined is provided in the previous tables summarizing operating results and operating data.\nYears Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet income attributable to HCA Healthcare, Inc. totaled $3.754 billion, or $10.93 per diluted share, for 2020, compared to $3.505 billion, or $10.07 per diluted share, for 2019. The 2020 results included $60 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, of employee retention payroll tax credits, as provided for by the CARES Act. The 2020 results also include losses on sales of facilities of $7 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $295 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. The 2019 results include gains on sales of facilities of $18 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $211 million, or $0.47 per diluted share. Revenues for 2020 include $55 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, related to the settlement of Medicare outlier calculations for prior periods and $69 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to the resolution of transaction price differences regarding certain services performed in prior periods. Revenues for 2019 include $86 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the resolution of transaction price differences regarding certain services performed in prior periods. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of $112 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, and $50 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, respectively. Our provisions for income taxes for 2020 and 2019 included tax benefits of $92 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, and $65 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 343.605 million shares and 348.226 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring 2020, consolidated admissions declined 4.7% and same facility admissions declined 4.8% compared to 2019. Consolidated and same facility inpatient surgeries both declined 7.8% during 2020 compared to 2019. Emergency room visits declined 18.7% on a consolidated basis and declined 18.8% on a same facility basis during 2020 compared to 2019. We believe the declines in emergency room visits were primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns regarding possible exposure to the virus.\nRevenues increased 0.4% to $51.533 billion for 2020 from $51.336 billion for 2019. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the net impact of a 10.5% increase in revenue per equivalent admission offset by a 9.2% decline in equivalent admissions compared to 2019. Same facility revenues declined 0.1% due primarily to the net impact of a 9.3% decline in same facility equivalent admissions offset by a 10.1% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission compared to 2019. We believe the declines in equivalent admissions were primarily due to declines in the relative percentage of outpatient service volume due to restrictions on services for certain periods and the general concerns regarding exposure to the virus.\nSalaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 46.3% in 2020 and 45.9% in 2019. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 11.6% in 2020 compared to 2019, with the increase being partially related to the 9.2% decline in equivalent admissions. Same facility labor rate increases averaged 2.9% for 2020 compared to 2019. Share-based compensation expense was $362 million in 2020 and $347 million in 2019.\n73\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResults of Operations (continued)\nYears Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (continued)\nSupplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.2% in 2020 and 16.5% in 2019. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 8.6% in 2020 compared to 2019. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 5.5% for medical devices, 9.6% for pharmacy supplies and 10.6% for general medical and surgical items in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOther operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 18.1% in 2020 and 18.5% in 2019. Other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $435 million and $497 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded reductions of $112 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, and $50 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, respectively, to our provision for professional liability risks related to the receipt of updated actuarial information.\nEquity in earnings of affiliates was $54 million for 2020 and $43 million for 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, were 5.3% in 2020 and 5.0% in 2019. Depreciation expense was $2.693 billion for 2020 and $2.579 billion for 2019, and the $114 million increase was due to capital expenditures and capital projects placed in service in 2020 (same facility depreciation and amortization increased $147 million).\nInterest expense declined to $1.584 billion for 2020 from $1.824 billion for 2019. The $240 million decline in interest expense was due to declines in both the average debt balance and the effective interest rate. Our average debt balance was $31.940 billion for 2020 compared to $34.288 billion for 2019. The average interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.0% for 2020 and 5.3% for 2019.\nLosses on sales of facilities were $7 million for 2020, and gains on sales of facilities were $18 million for 2019.\nDuring February 2020, we issued $2.700 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2030. During March 2020, we used the net proceeds for the redemption of all $1.000 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s 6.25% senior notes due 2021 and, together with available funds, for the redemption of all $2.000 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of HCA Inc.’s 7.50% senior notes due 2022. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $295 million. During June 2019, we issued $5.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes comprised of $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 4 1/8% notes due 2029, $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 1/8% notes due 2039 and $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% notes due 2049. During July 2019, we redeemed all $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 4.250% senior secured notes due 2019, all $3.000 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior secured notes due 2020 and all $1.350 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior secured notes due 2022. The pretax loss on retirement of debt for these redemptions was $211 million.\nThe effective tax rates were 21.7% and 23.9% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. Our provisions for income taxes for 2020 and 2019 also included tax benefits of $92 million and $65 million, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 would have been 23.7% and 25.3%, respectively.\n74\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nResults of Operations (continued)\nYears Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (continued)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $640 million for 2019 to $633 million for 2020. The decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to the operations of our surgery center partnerships.\nFor results of operations comparisons relating to years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, refer to our annual report on Form\n10-K,\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, dividends to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and sales of hospitals and health care entities.\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $9.232 billion in 2020 compared to $7.602 billion in 2019 and $6.761 billion in 2018. The $1.630 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2020, compared to 2019, was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding losses and gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, of $330 million and positive changes in working capital items of $1.366 billion, primarily from the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the collection of accounts receivable. During 2020, we deferred $688 million of Social Security taxes as allowed for under the CARES Act. Half of these taxes will be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remainder by December 31, 2022. The $841 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily related to the increase in net income, excluding gains on sales of facilities and losses on retirement of debt, of $222 million and increases related to income taxes of $322 million and depreciation and amortization of $318 million. Working capital totaled $3.629 billion at December 31, 2020 and $3.439 billion at December 31, 2019. Cash payments for interest and income taxes declined $154 million for 2020 compared to 2019 and increased $147 million for 2019 compared to 2018.\nCash used in investing activities was $3.393 billion, $5.720 billion and $3.901 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $2.835 billion in 2020, $4.158 billion in 2019 and $3.573 billion in 2018. We expended $568 million, $1.682 billion and $1.253 billion for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In response to the risks the\nCOVID-19\npandemic presents to our business, we reduced certain planned projects and capital expenditures during 2020. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $3.7 billion in 2021. At December 31, 2020, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $3.170 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.\nCash used in financing activities totaled $4.677 billion in 2020, $1.771 billion in 2019 and $3.075 billion in 2018. During 2020, we had net cash paid of $3.217 billion related to our indebtedness, paid dividends of $153 million and paid $441 million for repurchases of common stock. During 2019, we had a net increase of $567 million in our indebtedness, paid dividends of $550 million and paid $1.031 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2018, we had net cash paid of $344 million related to our indebtedness, paid dividends of $487 million and paid $1.530 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $626 million, $542 million and $441 million, respectively.\n75\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\nWe, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. During January 2020 and 2019, our Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs for up to $4 billion ($2 billion for each authorization) of our outstanding common stock, and at December 31, 2020, there was $2.800 billion of share repurchase authorization that remained available under the January 2020 and 2019 authorizations. During March 2020 in response to the risks the\nCOVID-19\npandemic presents to our business, we announced the suspension of our share repurchase program. During February 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the resumption of the share repurchase program, and an additional $6 billion was authorized for repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock ($8.8 billion of total repurchase authorization including the February 2021 authorization). Funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds. During 2019, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.40 per share, or $1.60 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. During January 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share on our common stock. During April 2020 in response to the risks the\nCOVID-19\npandemic presents to our business, we also suspended our quarterly dividend program. During February 2021, the Board of Directors reinstated the quarterly program and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share on our common stock. The timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the Company.\nIn addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($7.712 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $5.712 billion as of January 31, 2021) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets. We terminated our $2.000 billion 364-day senior secured term loan facility during January 2021.\nInvestments of our insurance subsidiaries, held to maintain statutory equity levels and to provide liquidity to pay claims, totaled $504 million and $462 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $188 million and $175 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.736 billion and $1.606 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $469 million. We estimate that approximately $413 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.\nFinancing Activities\nWe are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $31.004 billion and $33.722 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our interest expense was $1.584 billion for 2020 and $1.824 billion for 2019.\n76\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\nFinancing Activities (continued)\nDuring January 2019, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes comprised of $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% notes due 2029 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% notes due 2028. We used the net proceeds to fund the purchase of a seven-hospital health system located in western North Carolina.\nDuring June 2019, we issued $5.000 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes comprised of $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 4 1/8% notes due 2029, $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 1/8% notes due 2039 and $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% notes due 2049. During July 2019, we redeemed all $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior secured notes due 2019, all $3.000 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of 6.50% senior secured notes due 2020 and all $1.350 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior secured notes due 2022.\nDuring February 2020, we issued $2.700 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior notes due 2030. During March 2020, we used the net proceeds for the redemption of all $1.000 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s 6.25% senior notes due 2021 and, together with available funds, for the redemption of all $2.000 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of HCA Inc.’s 7.50% senior notes due 2022.\nDuring March 2020 in response to the risks the\nCOVID-19\npandemic presents to our business, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for\na 364-day secured\nterm loan facility for an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.000 billion. As of December 31, 2020, there was no amount outstanding or draw notices pending under the facility. We terminated this credit agreement during January 2021.\nManagement believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.\nSummarized Financial Information\nHCA Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of HCA Healthcare, Inc., is the primary obligor under a substantial portion of our indebtedness, including our senior secured credit facilities, senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes. The senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes issued by HCA Inc. are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by HCA Healthcare, Inc. The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility). For a list of subsidiary guarantors, see Exhibit 22 to this annual report on Form\n10-K.\nThe subsidiary guarantees rank senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of each subsidiary guarantor, equally in right of payment with all senior indebtedness of the subsidiary guarantor and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any\nnon-guarantor\nsubsidiaries of the subsidiary guarantors (other than indebtedness and liabilities owed to one of the subsidiary guarantors). The subsidiary guarantees are secured by first-priority liens on the subsidiary guarantors’ assets,\n77\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\nSummarized Financial Information (continued)\nsubject to certain exceptions, that secure our senior secured cash flow credit facility on a first-priority basis. The subsidiary guarantees are secured by second-priority liens on the subsidiary guarantors’ assets that secure our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility on a first-priority basis and our senior secured cash flow credit facility on a second-priority basis.\nThe subsidiary guarantees may be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon certain customary events, including in the event such guarantee is released under our senior secured credit facilities. The indentures governing the senior secured notes include a “savings clause” intended to limit each subsidiary guarantor’s obligations as necessary to prevent the guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which could reduce a subsidiary guarantor’s liability on its guarantee to zero. For further information regarding the guarantees, refer to the applicable indentures that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on Form\n10-K.\nSummarized financial information is presented on a combined basis and transactions between the combining entities have been eliminated. Financial information for nonguarantor entities has been excluded. The summarized operating results information for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the summarized balance sheet information at December 31, 2020, for HCA Healthcare, Inc., HCA Inc. and the subsidiary guarantors (the Parent, Subsidiary Issuer and Subsidiary Guarantors) follow (dollars in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2020:\n78\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\nSummarized Financial Information (continued)\nThe first-priority liens securing the subsidiary guarantees discussed above include liens on (i) substantially all of the capital stock of substantially all wholly owned first-tier subsidiaries of HCA Inc. or of subsidiary guarantors (but limited to 65% of the stock of any such wholly owned first-tier subsidiary that is a foreign subsidiary), subject to certain limited exceptions, and (ii) substantially all indebtedness owing to HCA Inc. or to the subsidiary guarantors, including any and all intercompany indebtedness owed by HCA Healthcare, Inc. or any subsidiary thereof to HCA Inc., or any subsidiary guarantor. For a list of affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes, see Exhibit 22 to this annual report on Form\n10-K.\nUnder the first lien intercreditor agreement, the administrative agent for the lenders under the cash flow credit facility, subject to the occurrence of certain events, has the exclusive right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to these liens, and the trustee for the senior secured notes has no right to take any such actions. In certain circumstances, including upon certain events of default under the senior secured credit facilities and the senior secured notes, the collateral agent in respect of the cash flow credit facility and the senior secured notes could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure such indebtedness, including the aforementioned pledged capital stock and pledged indebtedness, and require such collateral to be delivered to the collateral agent to the extent not already in its possession for purposes of perfecting the lien on such assets. For further information regarding the collateral, including events or circumstances that may require delivery of the collateral, refer to the applicable indentures, the first lien intercreditor agreement, the cash flow credit agreement and the pledge agreement that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on Form\n10-K.\nThere is no trading market for any of HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes.\nRule\n13-02\nof Regulation\nS-X\nrequires the presentation of summarized financial information of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes unless such information is not material. The rule provides that such information is not material if the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Registrant. Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company (“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA Inc., and the common stock of Healthtrust is pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure relationship of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and Healthtrust, all of HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s operating subsidiaries, including all other affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes, are also subsidiaries of Healthtrust. The corporate structure relationship, combined with the application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s consolidated financial statements related to HCA Healthcare Inc.’s debt and financial instruments, mean that the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Healthtrust (and, therefore, of the combined affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes) are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the financial statements of HCA Healthcare, Inc. As a result, summarized financial information of affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral for the senior secured notes is not required to be presented under Rule\n13-02.\n79\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $504 million at December 31, 2020. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2020, we had a net unrealized gain of $32 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.\nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.\nWith respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $1.171 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2020 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $29.833 billion at December 31, 2020 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt was 5.0% for 2020 and 5.3% for 2019.\nThe estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $35.814 billion at December 31, 2020. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $12 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.\nWe are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. We currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.\n80\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)\nMarket Risk (continued)\nFinancial Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.\nThe net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.\nTax Examinations\nThe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) was conducting an examination of the Company’s 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns at December 31, 2020. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities, and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n81"

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule\n13a-15(e)\npromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.\n2. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule\n13a-15(f).\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nErnst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Form\n10-K,\nhas issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\n82\n(b) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders\nHCA Healthcare, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, HCA Healthcare, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of HCA Healthcare, Inc. as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n83\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nNashville, Tennessee\nFebruary 19, 2021\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting."

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nF-2\nF-3\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994.\nNashville, Tennessee\nFebruary 19, 2021\nF-4\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(Dollars in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\n(Dollars in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(Dollars in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-8\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(Dollars in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-9\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nReporting Entity\nHCA Healthcare, Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate hospitals and related health care entities. The term “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2020 these affiliates owned and operated\n185\nhospitals,\n121\nfreestanding surgery centers,\n21\nfreestanding endoscopy centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary services. HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s facilities are located\nin\n20\nstates and England. The terms “Company,” “HCA,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its affiliates. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define “control” as ownership of a majority of the voting interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements include entities in which we absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. The accounts of acquired entities are included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to our acquisition of controlling interests. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities we do not control, but in which we have a substantial ownership interest and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.\nThe majority of our expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could be classified as general and administrative include our corporate office costs, which were $\n416\nmillion, $\n370\nmillion and $\n344\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCOVID-19\nPandemic and CARES Act Funding\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated\nCOVID-19\nas a global pandemic. Patient volumes and the related revenues for most of our services were significantly impacted during the latter portion of the first quarter and the first half of the second quarter of 2020 and have continued to be impacted as various policies that were implemented by federal, state and local governments in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, including policies that have caused many people to remain at home, forced the closure of or limitations on certain businesses, and suspended elective surgical procedures by health care facilities. While many of these restrictions have been eased across the U.S. and most states have lifted moratoriums on\nnon-emergent\nprocedures, restrictions remain in place or may be adopted or\nre-imposed,\nand the possibility exists that the public, particularly segments with a high mortality risk, could remain wary of real or perceived opportunities for exposure to the virus. We are unable to predict the future impact of the pandemic on our operations.\nDuring 2020, we received approximately $\n4.4\nbillion of accelerated Medicare payments and approximately $\n1.8\nbillion in general and targeted distributions from the Provider Relief Fund, both as provided for and established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act. During October 2020,\nwe announced our decision to return, or repay early, all of our share of the Provider Relief Fund distributions and all of the Medicare accelerated payments. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we returned, or repaid early, approximately $\n6.1\nbillion of these funds. The unreturned Provider Relief Funds of $\n83\nmillion, related to amounts received by certain of our partnership entities, are recorded under the caption “other accrued\nF-10\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nCOVID-19\nPandemic and CARES Act Funding (continued)\nexpenses” in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. Our share of these funds will be returned in 2021 after final determination of amounts earned and distributable to the members of each respective partnership.\nThe CARES Act also provides for a deferral of payments of the employer portion of Social Security tax incurred during the pandemic, allowing half of such payroll taxes to be deferred until December 2021 and the remaining half until December 2022. At December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred $\n688\nmillion of Social Security taxes. Additionally, the CARES Act created a payroll tax credit designed to encourage companies to retain employees during the pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company evaluated its eligibility for this credit and recorded $\n60\nmillion of employee retention payroll tax credits pursuant to the CARES Act. These tax credits were recorded as a reduction of salaries and benefits in our consolidated income statement.\nWe believe the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our operating results and financial condition has been and will continue to be driven by many factors, most of which are beyond our control and ability to forecast. Such factors include, but are not limited to\n:\nthe severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases in the areas in which we operate, the rollout and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines, the efficacy of public health controls, including vaccines, and the impact of any mutations of the virus; the scope and duration of stay-at-home practices and business closures and restrictions; recommended or required suspensions of elective procedures; continued declines in patient volumes for an indeterminable length of time; increases in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients as a result of higher sustained rates of unemployment; incremental expenses required for supplies and personal protective equipment; and changes in professional and general liability exposure. Because of these and other uncertainties, we cannot estimate how long or how severely the pandemic will impact our business. If we experience declines in cash flows and results of operations, such declines could have an impact on the inputs and assumptions used in significant accounting estimates, including estimated implicit price concessions related to uninsured patient accounts, professional and general liability reserves, and potential impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets.\nRevenues\nOur revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which our performance obligations are to provide health care services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period our obligations to provide health care services are satisfied.\nOur performance obligations for inpatient services are generally satisfied over periods that average approximately five days\n, and revenues are recognized based on charges incurred in relation to total expected charges.\nOur performance obligations for outpatient services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day\n. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payer (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by (Medicare and Medicaid) or negotiated with (managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies) the third-party payers. The payment arrangements with third-party payers for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges. Medicare generally pays for inpatient and outpatient services at prospectively determined rates based on clinical, diagnostic and other factors. Services provided to patients having Medicaid coverage are generally paid at prospectively\nF-11\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenues (continued)\ndetermined rates per discharge, per identified service or per covered member. Agreements with commercial insurance carriers, managed care and preferred provider organizations generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted\nfee-for-service\nrates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.\nOur revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payers. Estimates of contractual adjustments under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record these revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.\nOur revenues by primary third-party payer classification and other (including uninsured patients) for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\nLaws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the “cost report” filing and settlement process). The adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year resulted in net increases to revenues of $\n70\nmillion, $\n51\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years resulted in a net\nreduction\nto revenues of $\n5\nmillion in 2020 and net increases to revenues of $\n13\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an\nF-12\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenues (continued)\nindividual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive.\nPatients treated at hospitals for\nnon-elective\ncare, who have income at or below\n400\n%\nof the federal poverty level, were eligible for charity care, and we limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. Patients treated at hospitals for non-elective care, who have income above\n400\n% of the federal poverty level, were eligible for certain other discounts which limit the patient responsibility amounts for these patients to a percentage of their annual household income, computed on a sliding scale based upon their annual income and the applicable percentage of the federal poverty level. We apply additional discounts to limit patient responsibility for certain emergency services. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. We may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance, or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.\nThe collection of outstanding receivables for Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. Implicit price concessions relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Estimated implicit price concessions are recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the age of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been performed.\nThe estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and collections at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated implicit price concession amounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable estimates of our revenues and valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to the valuations of our accounts receivable or\nperiod-to-period\ncomparisons of our\nrevenues\n. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, estimated implicit price concessions of $\n6.108\nbillion and $\n6.953\nbillion, respectively, had been recorded to adjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the estimated amounts we expect to collect.\nF-13\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nRevenues (continued)\nTo quantify the total impact of the trends related to uninsured patient accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view total uncompensated care, which is comprised of charity care, uninsured discounts and implicit price concessions.\nA summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions):\nThe total uncompensated care amounts include charity care of $\n13.763\nbillion, $\n13.260\nbillion and $\n8.611\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The estimated costs of charity care were $\n1.652\nbillion, $\n1.591\nbillion and $\n1.068\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCash and Cash\nEquivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include\nhighly\nliquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our insurance subsidiaries’ cash equivalent investments in excess of the amounts required to pay estimated professional liability claims during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash equivalents as these funds are not available for general corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nOur cash management system provides for daily investment of available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks totaling $\n495\nmillion and $\n486\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, have been included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are funded through available cash balances or our credit facility.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe receive payments for services rendered from federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and patients. We recognize that revenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to our operations, but do not believe there are significant credit risks associated with these government agencies. We do not believe there are any other significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the collection of our accounts receivable. Days revenues in accounts receivable were\n45\ndays,\n50\ndays and\n51\ndays at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. The five-day decline from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the combined impact of a $\n329\nmillion decline in accounts receivable at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, and a\n5.7\n% increase in fourth\nF-14\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nAccounts Receivable (continued)\nquarter 2020 revenues per day compared to fourth quarter 2019 revenues per day. Changes in general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost\n(first-in,\nfirst-out)\nor market.\nProperty and Equipment\nDepreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method, was $\n2.693\nbillion in 2020, $\n2.579\nbillion in 2019 and $\n2.262\nbillion in 2018. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from\n10\nto\n40\nyears. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary generally from\nfour\nto\n10\nyears.\nWhen events, circumstances or operating results indicate the carrying values of certain long-lived assets expected to be held and used might be impaired, we prepare projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of recent sales of similar assets and independent appraisals.\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent sales of similar assets and market responses based upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.\nInvestments of Insurance Subsidiaries\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the investments of our\n100\n% owned insurance subsidiaries were classified as\n“available-for-sale”\nas defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 320,\nInvestments — Debt Securities\nand are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held for the purpose of providing a funding source to pay liability claims covered by the insurance subsidiaries. We perform quarterly assessments of individual investment securities to determine whether declines in fair value are due to credit-related or noncredit-related factors. Our investment securities evaluation process involves subjective judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a significant level of professional judgment in determining whether a credit-related impairment has occurred. We evaluate, among other things, the financial position and near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to determine if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is considered to be a credit-related impairment. The extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s fair value, are important components of our investment securities evaluation process.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. In addition to the annual impairment review, impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist.\nF-15\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets (continued)\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, and our impairment testing is performed at the operating division level. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit assets is less than their carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated based upon internal evaluations of each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of market multiples, revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar facilities.\nNo\ngoodwill impairments were recognized during 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nDuring 2020, goodwill increased by $\n279\nmillion related to acquisitions, including the finalization of the accounting for certain prior year acquisitions, and declined\nby $\n9\nmillion related to foreign currency translation and other adjustments. During 2019, goodwill increased by $\n332\nmillion related to acquisitions and declined by $\n4\nmillion related to foreign currency translation and other adjustments.\nDuring 2020, identifiable intangible assets increased by $65 million related to acquisitions, including the finalization of the accounting for certain prior year acquisitions, and declined by\n$\n26\nmillion due to amortization and other adjustments. During 2019, identifiable intangible assets declined by $\n12\nmillion due to amortization, foreign currency translation and other adjustments. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over estimated lives ranging generally from\nthree\nto\n10\nyears.\nThe gross carrying amounts of identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were\n$\n249\nmillion and $\n184\nmillion, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $\n149\nmillion and $\n123\nmillion, respectively. The gross carrying amount of indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n269\nmillion. Indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests, and impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist.\nDebt Issuance Costs and Discounts\nDebt issuance costs and discounts are amortized based upon the terms of the respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of debt issuance costs and discounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n411\nmillion and $\n413\nmillion, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $\n175\nmillion and $\n174\nmillion, respectively. Amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts is included in interest expense and was $\n30\nmillion, $\n30\nmillion and $\n31\nmillion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nProfessional Liability Claims\nReserves for professional liability risks were $\n1.963\nbillion and $\n1.827\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The current portion of the reserves, $\n477\nmillion and $\n457\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were\n$\n435\nmillion, $\n497\nmillion and $\n447\nmillion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in “other operating expenses” in our consolidated income statements. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded reductions to the provision for professional liability risks of\n$\n112\nmillion\n,\n$\n50\nmillion and $\n70\nmillion,\nrespectively, due to the receipt of updated actuarial information. Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and\nF-16\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nProfessional Liability Claims (continued)\nfrequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new information becomes known. Adjustments to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results. The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately\n2,300\nindividual claims at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. During 2020 and 2019, $\n292\nmillion and $\n408\nmillion, respectively, of net payments were made for professional and general liability claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate; however, there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates.\nA portion of our professional liability risks is insured through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary. Subject, in most cases, to a $\n15\nmillion per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $\n50\nmillion per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of either\n$\n25\nmillion or $\n35\nmillion per occurrence, depending on the jurisdiction for the related claim. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.\nThe obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent the reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance and excess insurance contracts. The amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts include $\n31\nmillion and $\n37\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, recorded in “other assets,” and $\n8\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, recorded in “other current assets.”\nFinancial Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are employed to manage interest rate risks, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize our interest rate swap derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), provided the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the forecasted transactions when they occur. In the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive income is recognized in earnings and generally the derivative is terminated.\nThe net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as adjustments to interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt originally associated with the terminated swap.\nNoncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities\nThe consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned entities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity of such entities.\nF-17\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 2 — SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation.\nStock Incentive Plans\nIn May 2020, the 2020 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Healthcare, Inc. and its\nAffiliates\n(the “2020 Plan”) was established to replace the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA\nHoldings\n, Inc. and its\nAffiliates (the “2006 Plan”).\nOur stock incentive plans are designed to promote the long term financial interests and growth of the Company by attracting and retaining management and other personnel, motivating them to achieve long range goals and aligning their interests with those of our stockholders through opportunities for stock-based compensation and stock ownership in the Company. Stock option, stock appreciation right (“SARs”) and restricted share unit (“RSUs”) grants vest solely based upon continued employment over a specific period of time, and performance share unit (“PSUs”) grants vest based upon both continued employment over a specific period of time and the achievement of predetermined financial targets over time.\nNo further grants will be made under the 2006 Plan, and no shares under the 2006 Plan are available for grant under the 2020 Plan.\nAt December 31, 2020 there were\n20.274\nmillion shares available for future grants under the 2020 Plan.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) provides our participating employees an opportunity to obtain shares of our common stock at a discount (through payroll deductions over three-month periods). At December 31, 2020,\n5.865\nmillion shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP provisions. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $\n13\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion, respectively, of compensation expense related to the ESPP.\nStock Option, SAR, RSU and PSU Activity – All Plans\nThe fair value of each stock option and SAR award is estimated on the grant date, using valuation models and the weighted average assumptions indicated in the following table. Awards under our stock incentive plans generally vest based on continued employment (“Time Stock Options and SARs” and “Time RSUs”) and based upon continued employment and the achievement of certain financial targets (“Performance Stock Options and SARs”, “Performance RSUs” and “PSUs”). PSUs have a three-year cumulative earnings per share target, and the number of PSUs earned can vary from zero (for actual performance of less than 90% of target for 2020 and 2019 grants and less than 80% of target for 2018 and prior grants) to two times the original PSU grant (for actual performance of 110% or more of target for 2020 and 2019 grants and 120% or more of target for 2018 and prior grants). Each grant is valued as a single award with an expected term equal to the average expected term of the component vesting tranches. The expected term of the share-based award is limited by the contractual term. We use historical exercise behavior data and other factors to estimate the expected term of the options and SARs.\nCompensation cost is recognized on the straight-line attribution method. The straight-line attribution method requires that total compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested portion of the grant-date fair value. The expected volatility is derived using historical stock price information for our common stock and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open-market exchanges. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to the expected share-based award life on the date of grant. The expected life is an estimate of the number of years a share-based award will be held before it is exercised.\nThe expected dividend yield is estimated based on the assumption that the dividend yield at date of grant will be maintained over the expected life of the grant.\nF-18\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 2 — SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (continued)\nStock Option, SAR, RSU and PSU Activity – All Plans (continued)\nInformation regarding Time Stock Options and SARs and Performance Stock Options and SARs activity during 2020, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (share amounts in thousands):\nThe weighted average fair values of stock options and SARs granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $\n35.98\n, $\n38.21\nand $\n28.90\nper share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n328\nmillion, $\n153\nmillion and $\n456\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and SARs was $\n53\nmillion.\nF-19\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 2 — SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (continued)\nStock Option, SAR, RSU and PSU Activity – All Plans (continued)\nInformation regarding Time RSUs, Performance RSUs and PSUs activity during 2020, 2019 and 2018 is summarized below (share amounts in thousands):\nThe total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n349\nmillion, $\n346\nmillion and $\n413\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and PSUs was $\n330\nmillion.\nNOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nDuring 2020, we paid $\n568\nmillion to\nacquire a hospital\nin New Hampshire and other nonhospital health care entities. During 2019, we paid $\n1.384\nbillion to acquire a\nseven\n-hospital health system in North Carolina and $\n298\nmillion to acquire nonhospital health care entities. During 2018, we paid $\n792\nmillion to acquire\ntwo\nhospital facilities and $\n461\nmillion to acquire nonhospital health care entities. Purchase price amounts have been allocated to the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets of these acquired entities aggregated $\n279\nmillion, $\n332\nmillion and $\n636\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the acquired entities subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effects of these acquired entities on our results of operations for periods prior to the respective acquisition dates were not significant.\nDuring 2020, we received proceeds of $\n68\nmillion and recognized a pretax loss of $\n7\nmillion ($\n9\nmillion after tax) related to the\nsale of a hospital\nfacility from our American Group (Mississippi market) and sales of real estate and other investments. During 2019, we received proceeds of $\n61\nmillion and recognized a pretax gain of $\n18\nmillion ($\n13\nmillion after tax) related to the\nsale of a hospital\nfacility from our American Group (a Louisiana\nF-20\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS (continued)\nmarket) and sales of real estate and other investments. During 2018, we received proceeds of $\n758\nmillion and recognized a pretax gain of $\n353\nmillion ($\n265\nmillion after tax) related to the sale of\ntwo\nhospital facilities from our American Group (Oklahoma market). During 2018, we also received proceeds of $\n50\nmillion and recognized pretax gains of $\n75\nmillion ($\n59\nmillion after tax) related to sales of real estate and other investments.\nNOTE 4 — INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (dollars in millions):\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) significantly revised U.S. corporate income taxes, including lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from\n35\n% to\n21\n% beginning in 2018. We completed our analysis of the impact of the Tax Act during 2018, reducing our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 by $\n67\nmillion related to a remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities for which we were unable to make reasonable estimates in 2017.\nOur provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included tax benefits of $\n92\nmillion, $\n65\nmillion and $\n124\nmillion, respectively, related to the settlement of employee equity awards. During 2018, we recorded a reduction to our provision for income taxes of $\n28\nmillion for tax credits related to certain 2017 hurricane-related expenses. Our foreign pretax income was $\n9\nmillion, $\n50\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rate follows:\nF-21\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 4 — INCOME TAXES (continued)\nA summary of the items comprising the deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 follows (dollars in millions):\nAt December 31, 2020, federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring in years\n2023\nthrough\n2039\n) available to offset future taxable income approximated $\n56\nmillion and $\n127\nmillion, respectively. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in any one year may be limited.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in millions):\nOur liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $\n508\nmillion, including accrued interest of $\n73\nmillion and excluding $\n34\nmillion that was recorded as reductions of the related deferred tax assets, as of December 31, 2020 ($\n550\nmillion, $\n62\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019). Unrecognized tax benefits of $\n157\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 ($\n160\nmillion as of December 31, 2019) would affect the effective rate, if recognized.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) was conducting an examination of the Company’s 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns at December 31, 2020. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities. Depending on the resolution of any federal, state and foreign tax disputes, the completion of examinations by federal, state or foreign taxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the range of any possible change.\nF-22\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 5 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\nWe compute basic earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, SARs, RSUs and PSUs, computed using the treasury stock method.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased\n3.287\nmillion shares,\n7.949\nmillion shares and\n14.070\nmillion shares, respectively, of our common stock.\nThe following table sets forth the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts):\nNOTE 6 — INVESTMENTS OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\nA summary of the insurance subsidiaries’ investments at December 31 follows (dollars in millions):\nF-23\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 6 — INVESTMENTS OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES (continued)\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the investments in debt securities of our insurance subsidiaries were classified as\n“available-for-sale.”\nChanges in unrealized gains and losses are recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss).\nScheduled maturities of investments in debt securities at December 31, 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe average expected maturity of the investments in debt securities at December 31, 2020 was\n5.2\nyears, compared to the average scheduled maturity of\n9.4\nyears. Expected and scheduled maturities may differ because the issuers of certain securities have the right to call, prepay or otherwise redeem such obligations prior to their scheduled maturity date.\nNOTE 7 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nWe have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between us and our counterparties based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates.\nPay-fixed\ninterest rate swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. The net interest payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements, generally match the timing of the related liabilities for the interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions.\nThe following table sets forth our interest rate swap agreements, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nDuring the next 12 months, we estimate $\n37\nmillion will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and will be included in interest expense.\nF-24\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 7 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\nDerivatives — Results of Operations\nThe following table presents the effect of our interest rate swaps on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nCredit-risk-related Contingent Features\nWe have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where we could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we have not been required to post any collateral related to these agreements. If we had breached these provisions at December 31, 2020, we would have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their aggregate, estimated termination value of $\n46\nmillion.\nNOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\nAccounting Standards Codification 820,\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n(“ASC 820”) emphasizes fair value is a market-based measurement, and fair value measurements should be determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities. ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).\nLevel 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.\nCash Traded Investments\nOur cash traded investments are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.\nF-25\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (continued)\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of these instruments.\nThe following tables summarize our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (dollars in millions):\nF-26\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (continued)\nThe estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $\n35.814\nbillion and $\n37.026\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to carrying amounts, excluding debt issuance costs and discounts, aggregating $\n31.240\nbillion and $\n33.961\nbillion, respectively. The estimates of fair value are generally based upon the quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.\nNOTE 9 — LONG-TERM DEBT\nA summary of long-term debt at December 31, including related interest rates at December 31, 2020, follows (dollars in millions):\nDuring February 2020, we issued $\n2.700\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n3.50\n% senior notes due 2030. During March 2020, we used the net proceeds for the redemption of all $\n1.000\nbillion outstanding aggregate principal amount of HCA Healthcare, Inc.’s\n6.25\n% senior notes due 2021 and, together with available funds, for the redemption of all $\n2.000\nbillion outstanding aggregate principal amount of HCA Inc.’s\n7.50\n% senior notes due 2022. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $\n295\nmillion.\nDuring March 2020 in response to the risks the COVID-19 pandemic presents to our business, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a 364-day secured term loan facility for an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n2.000\nbillion. As of December 31, 2020 there was no amount outstanding or draw notices pending under the facility. We terminated this credit agreement during January 2021.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities And Other Senior Secured Debt\nWe have entered into the following senior secured credit facilities:\n(i) a $\n3.750\nbillion asset-based revolving credit facility maturing on\nJune 28, 2022\nwith a borrowing base of\n85\n%\nof eligible accounts receivable, subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria\n(\nnone\noutstanding at December 31, 2020) (the “ABL credit facility”); (ii) a $\n2.000\nbillion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on\nJune 28, 2022\n(\nnone\noutstanding at December 31, 2020 without giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit); (iii) a\n$\n2.000\nbillion senior secured 364-day term loan facility maturing on\nMarch 18, 2021\n(\nnone\noutstanding at December 31, 2020 and\nthe\nF-27\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 9 — LONG-TERM DEBT (continued)\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities And Other Senior Secured Debt (continued)\nfacility was\nterminated during January 2021); (iv) a\n$\n1.078\nbillion senior secured term loan A-6 facility maturing on\nJuly 16, 2024\n; (v) a $\n1.459\nbillion senior secured term loan B-12 facility maturing on\nMarch 13, 2025\n; and (vi) a $\n1.134\nbillion senior secured term loan B-13 facility maturing on\nMarch 18, 2026\n.\nWe refer to the facilities described under (ii) through (vi) above, collectively, as the “cash flow credit facility” and, together with the ABL credit facility, the “senior secured credit facilities.”\nBorrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus\n0.50\n% or (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios.\nThe senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (and some or all of our subsidiaries’) ability to incur additional indebtedness, repay subordinated indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and distributions, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we are required to satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the cash flow credit facility and, in certain situations under the ABL credit facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant.\nSenior secured notes consists of (i) $\n1.250\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.75\n% first lien notes due 2023; (ii) $\n2.000\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n5.00\n% first lien notes due 2024; (iii) $\n1.400\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n5.25\n% first lien notes due 2025; (iv) $\n1.500\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n5.25\n% first lien notes due 2026; (v) $\n1.200\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.50\n% first lien notes due 2027; (vi) $\n2.000\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n4 1/8\n% first lien notes due 2029; (vii) $\n1.000\nbillion aggregate principal amount of 5 1/8% first lien notes due 2039; (viii) $\n1.500\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n5.50\n% first lien notes due 2047; and (ix) $\n2.000\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n5 1/4\n% first lien notes due 2049. Finance leases and other secured debt totaled $\n767\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nWe use interest rate swap agreements to manage the variable rate exposure of our debt portfolio. At December 31, 2020, we had entered into effective interest rate swap agreements, in a total notional amount of $\n2.500\nbillion, in order to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with the senior secured credit facilities. The effect of the interest rate swaps is reflected in the effective interest rates for the senior secured credit facilities.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nSenior unsecured notes consist of (i) $\n12.091\nbillion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with maturities ranging from\n2023\nto\n2033\n; (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $\n125\nmillion medium-term notes maturing 2025; and (iii) an aggregate principal amount of $\n736\nmillion debentures with maturities ranging from\n2023\nto\n2095\n.\nF-28\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 9 — LONG-TERM DEBT (continued)\nGeneral Debt Information\nThe senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture (the “1993 Indenture”) dated December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our ABL credit facility).\nAll obligations under the ABL credit facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the receivables of the borrowers and each guarantor under such ABL credit facility (the “Receivables Collateral”).\nAll obligations under the cash flow credit facility and the guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by:\nOur senior secured notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on our and our subsidiary guarantors’ assets, subject to certain exceptions, that secure our cash flow credit facility on a first-priority basis and are secured by second-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on our and our subsidiary guarantors’ assets that secure our ABL credit facility on a first-priority basis and our other cash flow credit facility on a second-priority basis.\nMaturities of long-term debt in years\n2022\nthrough\n2025\nare $\n233\nmillion, $\n2.799\nbillion, $\n3.163\nbillion and $\n5.872\nbillion, respectively.\nNOTE 10 — LEASES\nWe adopted ASU\nNo. 2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842)\n, which requires leases with durations greater than 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet, effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. We lease property and equipment under finance and operating leases. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record the related assets and obligations at the present value of lease payments over the term. Many of our leases include rental escalation clauses and renewal options that are factored into our determination of lease payments, when appropriate. We do not separate lease and nonlease components of contracts. Generally, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments, as most of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate.\nF-29\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 10 — LEASES (continued)\nThe following table presents our lease-related assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nThe following table presents certain information related to lease expense for finance and operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nF-30\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 10 — LEASES (continued)\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nMaturities of Lease Liabilities\nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted minimum lease payment amounts to the operating and finance lease liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\nNOTE 11 — CONTINGENCIES\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us\n,\nwhich may not be covered by insurance. We are also subject to claims by various taxing authorities for additional taxes and related interest and penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nGovernment Investigations, Claims and Litigation\nHealth care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies.

Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTexas operates a state Medicaid program pursuant to a waiver from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (“Program”). The Program includes uncompensated-care pools; payments from these pools are intended to defray the uncompensated costs of services provided by our and other hospitals to Medicaid eligible or uninsured individuals. Separately, we and other hospitals provide charity care services in several communities in the state. In 2018, the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas requested information about whether the Program, as operated in Harris County, complied with the laws and regulations applicable to provider related donations, and the Company cooperated with that request. On May 21, 2019, a\nqui tam\nlawsuit asserting violations of the FCA and the Texas Medicaid Fraud Prevention Act related to the Program, as operated in Harris County, was unsealed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Both the federal and state governments declined to intervene in the\nqui tam\nlawsuit.

We use adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe geographic distributions of our revenues, equity in earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, assets and goodwill and other intangible assets are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\nF-34\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 14 — SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION (continued)\nF-35\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 15 — OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows (dollars in millions):\nF-36\nHCA HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 16 — ACCRUED EXPENSES\nA summary of other accrued expenses at December 31 follows (dollars in millions):\nF-37"
