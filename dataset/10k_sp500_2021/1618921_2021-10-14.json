To advance its strategy, the Company announced majority investments in Village Practice Management Company, LLC (“VillageMD”) and CareCentrix, Inc. (“CareCentrix”) which it believes will strengthen Walgreens Health capabilities in primary care, post-acute care and home care.\nSee Note 21. Subsequent events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein for further information.\nRecent Transactions\nPharmaceutical Wholesale Transaction\nOn January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, AmerisourceBergen agreed to purchase the majority of the Company's Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the Company’s retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe (“Disposal Group”) for approximately $6.5 billion, comprised of $6.275 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (the “Alliance Healthcare Sale”). Alliance Healthcare’s investment in China and Italy and its operations in Germany were not included in the Disposal Group, and the Company's retail pharmacy international operations in The Netherlands, Norway and Lithuania were included in the Disposal Group. The Disposal Group met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations.\nTherefore, the related assets, liabilities and operating results of the Disposal Group are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nOn June 1, 2021 the Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale, for total consideration of $6.9 billion, which includes cash consideration of $6.7 billion, subject to net cash and working capital adjustments. The Company recorded a gain before currency translation adjustments of $1.1 billion and a net gain on disposal of $0.3 billion. The gain on sale was presented as part of results of the discontinued operations. After giving effect to the Alliance Healthcare Sale, the Company beneficially owns approximately 28.5% of AmerisourceBergen’s outstanding common stock, based on the share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn connection with the Alliance Healthcare Sale, the Company and AmerisourceBergen also agreed to (i) a three-year extension through 2029 of the U.S. pharmaceutical distribution agreement pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S., (ii) a three-year extension of the agreement, that provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH, the Company’s global sourcing enterprise, (iii) a distribution agreement pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen will supply branded and generic pharmaceutical products to the Company’s Boots UK business following the closing of the Alliance Healthcare Sale and (iv) a commitment to pursue a series of strategic initiatives designed to create incremental growth and efficiencies in sourcing, logistics and distribution.\nSee Note 2 Discontinued operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nVillageMD investment\nIn July 2020, the Company and VillageMD announced an expansion of their partnership and the intent to open 500 to 700 “Village Medical at Walgreens” physician-led primary care clinics over a five-year period. This expanded partnership was supported by the Company’s investment in VillageMD over three years of $1.0 billion in equity and convertible debt, which included an initial $250 million equity investment.\nOn January 6, 2021, the Company and VillageMD announced the acceleration of the Company's investment in VillageMD. The Company completed the remaining $750 million investment during the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, which will support the opening of 600 to 700 clinics in more than 30 U.S. markets over a four-year period, with the intent to build hundreds more thereafter.\nThe Company held approximately 22% ownership interest in VillageMD as of August 31, 2021 and accounted for it using the equity method of accounting. It was anticipated, assuming full conversion of the debt, that the Company would hold approximately 30% ownership interest in VillageMD upon conversion.\nOn October 14, 2021 the Company announced that it has agreed to make an additional $5.2 billion investment in VillageMD to advance its strategic position in the delivery of value-based primary care. The incremental investment increases the Company’s ownership stake in VillageMD to approximately 63% from approximately 30% on a fully diluted basis, and increases the number of co-located clinics from 600 primary care clinics to 1,000 by the year 2027. The investment will be comprised of $4.0 billion in cash, to be paid by the Company to VillageMD at the closing of the transaction, and a promissory note in the principal amount of $1.2 billion to VillageMD at the closing of the transaction. The Company expects to fund the cash portion of the investment through a combination of cash on hand and available credit facilities\nSee Note 21. Subsequent events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein for further information.\niA acquisition\nOn December 29, 2020, the Company acquired a majority equity interest in Innovation Associates, Inc. (“iA”) for a cash consideration of $451 million. iA is a leading-edge provider of software enabled automation solutions for retail, hospital, federal healthcare and mail-order pharmacy markets. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination and consolidates iA within the United States segment in its financial statements.\nPharmaceutical Wholesale business in Germany\nOn November 1, 2020, the Company and McKesson Corporation closed a transaction to form a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany, as part of a strategic alliance. The Company owns a 70% controlling equity interest in the combined business which is consolidated by the Company and reported within the International segment in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of\n$296 million consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in the combined business. See Note 3 Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nRelationship with AmerisourceBergen\nWalgreens is party to various agreements and arrangements with AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”) including (a) a pharmaceutical distribution agreement under which the Company sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and (b) an agreement under which AmerisourceBergen accesses generic pharmaceutical products through the Company’s global sourcing enterprise, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH. These agreements have been amended multiple times, most recently in June 2021, in connection with the Company's sale of its Alliance Healthcare business to AmerisourceBergen\n(the “Alliance Healthcare Sale”). Pursuant to those amendments, the U.S. distribution agreement was extended through 2029 and the parties committed to pursue additional opportunities in sourcing and distribution. The parties also agreed that Alliance Healthcare UK will remain the distribution partner of Boots until 2031.\nThe Company also holds a substantial investment in AmerisourceBergen. As of August 31, 2021, the Company owned 58,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock, representing approximately 28.5% of its outstanding common stock based on the share count most recently reported by AmerisourceBergen. The Company has a shareholders agreement with AmerisourceBergen, which was most recently amended and restated in connection with the Alliance Healthcare Sale (the “A&R Shareholders Agreement”). Pursuant to the A&R Shareholders Agreement, the Company has designated one member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The Company is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market, and thereafter to designate another member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.\nThe Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Company’s United States segment.\nSee Management’s discussion and analysis in Part II, Item 7 and Note 2 Discontinued operations, Note 6 Equity method investments and Note 19 Related parties, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, below for additional information.\nIndustry overview\nThe retail pharmacy industry across the globe is highly competitive and dynamic and has experienced consolidation and an evolving competitive landscape in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. The Company believes the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the U.S., “baby boomers” increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program. Pharmaceutical wholesalers act as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients.\nThe retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third-party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third-party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the U.S., can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) was enacted to help control federal healthcare spending, including for prescription drugs, in the U.S. These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements in the U.S. State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements. When third-party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.\nThese industry dynamics and challenges are continuous and have intensified in recent years. Since the completion of the strategic combination of Walgreens and Alliance Boots in December 2014, the Company has had a continuous focus on operational efficiencies and cost reduction.\nGeneric prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third-party payers. The Company expects the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase. In general, in the U.S., generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a “generic conversion”. In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit dollars. In general, in the U.S., the specialty prescription business is also growing and generates higher sales dollars per prescription, but lower gross margin, as compared to generic prescription drugs.\nThe Company expects that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which the Company competes to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and the Company believes rising healthcare costs and the limited access to primary care physicians present opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings.\nSegments\nThe Company's operations are conducted through two reportable segments:\n•\nUnited States; and\n•\nInternational\nFor fiscal 2021, our segment sales were: United States, $112.0 billion and International $20.5 billion. Additional information relating to our segments is included in Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7 below and in Note 17 Segment reporting and Note 18 Sales, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nUnited States\nThe United States segment includes the Company's Walgreens business, which includes the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, and mail and central specialty pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.\nSales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise. The United States segment (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail offerings in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. The Company operated 8,965 retail stores in the segment as of August 31, 2021. The principal retail pharmacy brands in the segment are Walgreens and Duane Reade. The Company is a market leader in the U.S. and, as of August 31, 2021, approximately 78% of the population of the U.S. lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy.\nThe Company is focused on creating a neighborhood health destination and a more modern pharmacy aligned to a wider range of healthcare services. Significant investments in fiscal 2021 have accelerated the Company's customer-centric approach, with specific focus on transforming omni-channel capabilities and offerings across retail and healthcare. The Company’s services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers, including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. The Company utilizes its retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to its customers and patients, as illustrated by the Company’s ability to play a significant role in providing vaccinations. Additionally, through our key collaborations, we aim to develop new health care delivery models and to improve the speed, efficiency and safety of the prescription fulfillment process. We have taken further steps to develop our neighborhood health destinations, working with our healthcare strategic partners such as VillageMD to provide an integrated primary care and pharmacy model that aims to drive better health outcomes, reduce costs and provide a differentiated patient experience to the communities we serve.\nThe Company also provides specialty pharmacy and mail services and offers other health and wellness services throughout the U.S., most of which are operated by our strategic healthcare partners. The Company has more than 85,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals.\nThe segment provides customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise, such as NICE!, Finest Nutrition, No7, and Soap & Glory, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across the U.S. Integrated with the Company’s e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive notifications when a refill is due and choose their delivery option, which includes in-store pick up, drive-through or delivery to their home.\nIn fiscal 2021, we launched myWalgreens, replacing the former Balanced Rewards customer loyalty program, to provide a new interface for customers to access the enhanced and growing Walgreens digital offering. The new program simplifies how customers accumulate and use rewards. Points have been replaced by Walgreens Cash, reflecting the actual value of the reward and allowing the cash benefit to be applied as the customer chooses, not just to future transactions at Walgreens but even in support of their favorite charity or community cause. The number of myWalgreens members continue to grow and as of August 31, 2021, totaled approximately 85 million.\nThe Walgreens Find Care platform also includes telehealth service providers, connecting patients and customers with options to access convenient and affordable care from their mobile devices. Additionally, the Company has expanded the retail functionality of its mobile application, such as extending drive-through service to include retail products, curbside collection for online orders and same day offerings including pick up orders within 30 minutes. The Company also offers on-demand delivery to its customers through its collaborations with DoorDash and Postmates. The segment is also implementing new approaches to promotions, product selection and other areas to deliver greater value to its customers in its stores, including an enhanced beauty offering.\nThe components of the segment’s sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, health and wellness, beauty and personal care, and consumables and general merchandise). The segment’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the cough, cold and flu seasons and winter holiday. This seasonality also can affect the segment’s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the segment’s fiscal year sales were as follows:\nThe Company filled 827.5 million prescriptions (including vaccinations) in the segment in fiscal 2021. Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. The Company fills prescriptions under Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed or sponsored health benefit and prescription drug plans and programs, including the federal 340B drug pricing program. Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were approximately 97% of the segment’s fiscal 2021 Pharmacy sales.\nThe Company fills prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4% of the segment’s fiscal 2021 sales. Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 20% of the segment’s fiscal 2021 sales.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company also introduced the new myWalgreens Credit Card program, featuring two industry-first retail health and wellness credit cards. The myWalgreens Mastercard and the myWalgreens Credit Card are the first ever of their kind to reward more personalized wellbeing choices and offer industry-leading rewards at Walgreens locations, Walgreens.com, Duane Reade stores, via the Walgreens mobile app, and wherever Mastercard is accepted.\nAmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the segment’s pharmacies. The Company purchases its non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.\nThe segment’s sales, gross profit margin and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions filled that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of the Company’s control can affect timing for a generic conversion, the Company faces substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods.\nThe current environment of the Company’s pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure, a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions), an increased volume of Medicare Part D prescriptions and increased consumer use of prescription discount cards. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.\nThe Company continuously faces reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, government, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payers; agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and the Company’s reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. The Company experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2021 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The Company expects these pressures to continue.\nThe Company has also worked to develop and expand its relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time.\nThe Company’s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides the Company with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. Similarly, the specialty prescription business, which generates higher sales dollars per prescription, may result in gross margin pressures within the industry, as compared to generic prescription drugs.\nThe segment’s performance is also impacted by the current environment, including the uncertainty as a result of COVID-19. For more information, see Risk factors in Item 1A below.\nInternational\nThe International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and the pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution business in Germany.\nPharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the United Kingdom (“UK”), the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products. The Company operated 4,031 retail stores in the segment as of August 31, 2021 (see properties in Part I, Item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage) and has grown its omni-channel platform, including its online presence, in recent years. In the UK, the Company is a market leader and its retail stores are conveniently located with pharmacists well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities the Company serves.\nThe Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands the Company owns, such as No7, Liz Earle, Soap & Glory, Botanics, Sleek MakeUp, Boots Pharmaceuticals and ‘only at Boots’ exclusive products, together with its long established reputation for trust and customer care. The Company’s brands portfolio is enhanced by its in-house product research and development capabilities. The Company has introduced new beauty brands and beauty halls in key locations. Certain of the product brands of the Company are also sold by third-party retailers.\nThe Company’s retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the UK, through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, the ‘order and collect’ service normally allows customers to order from a range of over 37,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect the following day from approximately 74% of the UK’s retail stores.\nThe Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2021, the number of active Boots Advantage Card members (members who have used their card in the last six months) totaled approximately 12 million.\nIn addition, Boots in the UK is one of the leaders in the optical market with 548 practices, of which 160 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2021. Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices.\nThe components of the segment’s sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail\n(primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the UK, the provision of optical services). Further, the segment also has a wholesale business in Germany with 41 distribution centers which distribute prescription medicines to pharmacies and other similar health care facilities.\nThe segment’s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the segment’s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the segment’s fiscal year sales were as follows:\nThe segment’s Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third-party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the UK, which is the segment’s largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is typically reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis.\nThe segment’s Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically the Company and its competitors’ pricing actions, promotional offers and events and the customer’s desire for value and convenience.\nThe segment’s Wholesale sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues.\nIn addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British pound sterling being the most significant.\nThe segment’s performance and relevant exchange rates are also impacted by the current environment, including the uncertainty as a result of COVID-19. For more information relating to these topics, see Risk factors in Item 1A below.\nIntellectual property and licenses\nThe Company markets products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and tradenames and relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns numerous domain names, holds numerous patents, has registered numerous trademarks and has filed applications for the registration of a number of other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. The Company holds assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of the business.\nSeasonal variations in business\nThe Company’s business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, COVID-19, its sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of its own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third-party payers. See the summary of quarterly results (unaudited) in Note 20 Supplementary financial information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below.\nSources and availability of raw materials\nInventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. The Company does not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on its business or that of any of its segments.\nWorking capital practices\nEffective inventory management is important to the Company’s operations. The Company uses various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Its working capital\nneeds typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. The Company generally finances its inventory and expansion needs with internally-generated funds and short-term debt. For additional information, see the liquidity and capital resources section in Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, below.\nCustomers\nThe Company sells to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. In fiscal 2021, substantially all of our retail pharmacy sales were to customers covered by third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) that agree to pay for all or a portion of a customer's eligible prescription purchases. Three third-party payers accounted for approximately 33% of the Company’s consolidated sales in fiscal 2021.\nSee Note 17 Segment reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nRegulation\nIn the countries in which the Company does business, the Company is subject to national, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to the Company’s filling of prescriptions under Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed or sponsored health benefit plan and prescription drug plans and programs including the federal 340B drug pricing program; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”); the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of the Company’s businesses. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions.\nThe Company is also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which it does business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of its businesses, the Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances.\nCompetitive conditions\nThe industries in which the Company operates are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, the Company competes with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. The Company's wholesale offerings and related investments compete with pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. The Company competes primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Its geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See “Properties” in Part I, Item 2, below for further information regarding the Company’s geographic dispersion.\nHuman Capital Management\nThe Company’s purpose is to help people across the world lead healthier and happier lives. The Company recognizes that building healthier, happier communities starts with healthy, happy employees and is committed to: attracting, developing and retaining employees to deliver the highest levels of service to our customers and patients, supporting the personal health and well-being of employees, investing in talent development and employee engagement, fostering a diverse and inclusive culture for all, and implementing a robust approach to health and safety. Since most employees work directly with patients and customers to provide essential services, supporting the health of employees took on particular urgency with COVID-19.\nEmployees\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company employed approximately 315,000 persons globally, of which approximately 113,000 were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. Employees based in the U.S. and the UK account for 77% and 18% of the Company’s total workforce, respectively. The foregoing does not include employees of equity method investments.\nOversight and governance\nThe Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), through its Compensation and Leadership Performance Committee (the “CLP Committee”), provides oversight of human capital matters, including the Company’s diversity and inclusion initiatives. The CLP Committee is also responsible for periodically reviewing the Company’s compensation and benefits programs as well as management development and succession planning practices and strategies. The reports and recommendations to the Board via the CLP Committee underpin the broader framework that guides how the Company attracts, retains and develops its workforce in line with Company values.\nCompensation, benefits and well-being\nThe Company’s compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of employees and their families. The Company offers a comprehensive range of benefits to full- and part-time employees. In the U.S. the Company offers healthcare coverage, insurance benefits, access to a digital well-being program and an employee assistance program. In addition, the Company provides benefits such as paid time off, defined contribution plans, paid maternity and paternal leave, and a stock purchase plan.

Certain information related to retirement related benefit plans is included in Note 14 Retirement benefits, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nOn August 31, 2021, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Walgreen Co., will increase the starting hourly wage for its team members to $15.00 per hour, which will take effect in phases beginning in October 2021. The increase in starting hourly wage is expected to be fully implemented by November 1, 2022.\nTalent management and engagement\nThe Company has a talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. Several levels of employees participate in the Company’s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives. The Company offers numerous resources and programs to attract, engage, develop, advance and retain colleagues. Training and development programs provide employees the support they need to perform in their current roles while planning and preparing for future opportunities.

The Company conducts global employee engagement surveys that provide colleagues with an opportunity to share their opinions and helps the Company measure and improve engagement.\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”)\nA diverse, equitable and inclusive organization is an essential part of the Company’s business strategy, as we believe it positively impacts Company performance, growth and employee engagement. The Company’s policies strictly prohibit any form of discrimination or racial profiling, and the Company has several training programs in place which help identify and eliminate unconscious bias towards women and minority groups. The Company launched a global Diversity & Inclusion Report in September 2020 and recently released its Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report in September 2021, on the Company’s website, detailing its commitment to DE&I by highlighting the Company's DE&I strategy, initiatives, and key metrics. In addition to the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report, the Company also released the fiscal 2020 EEO-1 Form in September 2021, on the Company's website, a report filed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on the racial, ethnic and gender composition of its U.S. work force.\nThe Company established a Global Inclusion Council comprised of senior leaders from across its divisions and functions to drive a culture of diversity and inclusivity throughout the Company. It also developed a Leadership Accountability Model to ensure that managers are held accountable for recruitment, retention and development of people of color and women at every level of the organization. Beginning in fiscal 2021, a portion of the bonus incentive for all bonus eligible employees has been linked to the Company’s performance on the Leadership Accountability Model goals.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors corporate governance guidelines include provisions to actively seek out women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which Board nominees are chosen.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Board reaffirmed its commitment to diversity, when it amended the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charter of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board to provide that when searching for new directors, the Nominating and Governance Committee will actively seek out women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which Board nominees are chosen. In October 2020, the Board appointed Valerie B. Jarrett, who is the Company’s first female African American director and the fourth woman on the current Board. Further, in March 2021, the Company appointed Rosalind G. Brewer as a director and the Company’s first African American and first female Chief Executive Officer.\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nThe Company is committed to creating and upholding safe environments for employees, customers, contractors and patients across all of its business operations. The Company has a Health, Safety and Environmental Committee which works to continuously improve the management of health and safety. To create a safe and productive workplace, employees across the Company are offered avenues to report incidents including calling a toll-free, confidential hotline, submitting an online report, emailing the compliance officer and contacting human resources.\nCOVID-19\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented several measures to help ensure the health, safety and security of employees and customers. It implemented social distancing practices and enhanced cleaning protocols at all locations. It deployed a pandemic response system and team to manage and mitigate employee exposure cases, provide timely reporting of cases, and establish clinical and safety guidelines. The Company distributed personal protective equipment based on its safety professionals’ assessment of various activities employees perform. It added engineering controls and enhanced safety features in retail locations, including protective panels at pharmacy counters and front store checkout stations. The Company provided enhanced pay and benefits, including bonuses to frontline employees, financial assistance for those facing financial hardship and paid sick leave for employees who tested positive or were quarantined due to exposure. In addition, employees who work in support offices were provided with the tools to work from home and the flexibility to do so.\nFor more information on COVID-19 workplace and community response, see COVID-19 disclosures in Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in Part II, Item 7, below.\nAvailable information\nThe Company makes available free of charge on or through its website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company files or furnishes them to the SEC.

    "text": "In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 amplifies and exacerbates many of the risks we face in our business operations, including those discussed below. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Relating to COVID-19\nGlobal health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted, and may continue to severely impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. Over the course of fiscal 2021, governmental authorities imposed a variety of restrictions on people and businesses and public health authorities offered regular guidance on health and safety, all of which had an adverse impact on footfall in our stores, general economic activity and consumer behavior and spending patterns. COVID-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, all of which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic, including vaccinations, have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed, new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks and there is substantial uncertainty about the nature and degree of the continued effects of COVID-19 over time.\nThe pandemic and related measures have impacted and may continue to impact many aspects of our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to our growth, product costs, supply chain disruptions and the potential for inventory spoilage, labor shortages and costs, operating costs, logistics constraints, customer demand for our products and industry demand generally, consumer spending, our liquidity, the price of our securities, our ability to access capital markets, and the global economy and financial markets generally.\nWe have incurred and continue to incur additional costs to protect the health and well-being and meet the needs of our customers and team members. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our customers and employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our business operations. Further, the shift to a remote working environment and other policies has, and will continue to have, impacts on our business, including increased costs related to information technology infrastructure and the ability of our business and that of our suppliers to work with the same productivity. The increase in remote work arrangements has increased certain operational risks, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and could adversely affect our ability to manage our business.\nWe are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; our ability to execute strategic plans; impairments; and our profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nReductions in third-party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third-party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBM companies, governmental agencies, and other third-party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. In the U.S., plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliations payments can vary significantly and may not follow a predictable path. Further, in an environment where some PBM clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.\nIn addition, many payers in the U.S. are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. In addition, many state Medicaid fee-for-service programs have established pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost, which could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and governmental arrangements. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third-party payers, could adversely affect us.\nA shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans, products and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur United States segment seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, our United States segment has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, and specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S. and a larger proportion of our revenues. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, and specialty pharmacy sales are generally also lower margin. Our United States segment also has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in recent years, and that trend may continue. Preferred Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted market competitive reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third-party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales in the U.S. from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales in the U.S. from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Changes in pricing and other terms of our contracts with PBM companies can significantly impact our results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM company’s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period or on terms reasonably acceptable to us. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.\nWe could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.\nThe profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. Utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. Inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Also, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations.\nConsolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams.\nOur business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.\nOur Board of Directors approved the plans to increase the Transformational Cost Management Program described in \"Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\" in Part II, Item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these programs. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the Transformational Cost Management Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to implement the programs or deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\nChanges in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.\nOur performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), as well as looting, vandalism, acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving and changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.\nThe level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation, or the perception of potentially disruptive\ninnovation, by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and if required make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. All of our businesses face intense competition from multiple existing and new businesses, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. We continue to develop our offerings to respond to market dynamics; however, if our customers are not receptive to these changes, if we are unable to expand successful programs in a timely manner, or we otherwise do not effectively respond to changes in market dynamics, our businesses and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nSpecialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. Accordingly, it is important that we and our affiliates compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market, or our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. To better serve this evolving market, in March 2017, we and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. Certain clients of our joint venture were and are not obligated to contract through our joint venture, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving our joint venture. If this joint venture is not able to compete effectively in this evolving and highly competitive market and successfully adapt to changing market conditions, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase and has accelerated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel and differentiated retail models are rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.\nIf the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge the demand for products and services we sell or our customers’ purchasing habits, we may be faced with sales declines, excess product inventories and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.\nOur substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our International segment, and are subject to a number of risks, including, without limitation, compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands; tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; the impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies\noutside the U.S.; and the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets.\nThese factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nDisruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as COVID-19 or other health epidemics or pandemics, labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a supplier’s financial distress, natural disasters, looting, vandalism or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.\nWe outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. We rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. If our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.\nWe use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products.\nThe Company and AmerisourceBergen are parties to various agreements and arrangements, including a pharmaceutical distribution agreement between the Company and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. These agreements were amended in June 2021 in connection with the Alliance Healthcare Sale. Pursuant to those amendments, the U.S. distribution agreement was extended through 2029 and the parties committed to pursue additional opportunities in sourcing and distribution. The parties also agreed that Alliance Healthcare UK will remain the distribution partner of Boots until 2031. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes substantially all of our branded and generic pharmaceutical products. Consequently, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences, including those resulting from COVID-19. For example, if AmerisourceBergen’s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, pandemic, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nOur distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to retain and recruit, or failure to manage succession of, key personnel could have an adverse impact on our future performance.\nOur ability to attract, engage, develop and retain qualified and experienced employees at all levels, including in executive and other key strategic positions, is essential for us to meet our objectives. Competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries, benefits or other employee-related costs, or in our failure to recruit and retain employees which could have a materially adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, any failure to adequately plan for and manage succession of key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition into new roles could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. While we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these do not guarantee the services of these executives will continue to be available to us.\nWe may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. In addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. The terms of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of, or requested modifications to, those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. If we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.\nThe long-term effects of global climate change present both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes could over time affect, for example, the availability and cost of products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require. In addition, many of our operations and facilities around the world are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to stores, distribution or fulfillment centers, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events. We also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years, which may increase our costs associated with compliance and merchandise. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Strategy\nWe may not be successful in executing elements of our business strategy, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe engage in strategic initiatives to, among other reasons, maximize long-term shareholder value, expand on our consumer-centric approach, strengthen our partnerships with local healthcare providers and improve health outcomes. These strategic initiatives may not result in improvements in future financial performance. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these strategic initiatives, or that these initiatives will not result in additional unanticipated costs. The failure to realize the benefits of any strategic initiatives or successfully structure our business to meet market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nOur growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances.\nA significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic partnerships and alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, navigating the necessary regulatory approval requirements, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence, acquire and successfully integrate\nthe acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our growth strategies, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed.\nThe anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized.\nAs of August 31, 2021, we beneficially owned approximately 28.5% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one nominee for election to AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Company’s United States segment. The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen, including any charges which may arise relating to its ongoing opioid litigation matters, will impact the Company’s results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control and some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.\nFrom time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. Some of the businesses in which we have made noncontrolling investments operate in markets or industries that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic partnerships and alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons.\nCybersecurity, Data Privacy and Information Security Risks\nA significant disruption in our information technology and computer systems or those of businesses we rely on could harm us.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber-attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, changes in security processes, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. We rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services. Information technology projects or services frequently are long-term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, reputational harm, and increased costs that\ncould materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including strategic and business partners, key payers and vendors.\nPrivacy and data protection laws increase our compliance burden and any failure to comply could harm us.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. In the U.S., for example, HIPAA imposes extensive privacy and security requirements governing the transmission, use and disclosure of health information by covered entities in the health care industry, including health care providers such as pharmacies. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes stringent requirements on the use and treatment of “personal information” of California residents, and other jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing similar laws related to the protection of personal data. Outside the U.S., for example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union data protection laws and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders.\nCompliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, and other costs. We also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply. A significant privacy breach or failure to comply with privacy and information security laws could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation, business operations, financial position and results of operations.\nWe and businesses we interact with experience cybersecurity incidents and might experience significant computer system compromises or data breaches.\nThe protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach or theft of customer, employee, or company data, could create significant workflow disruption, attract media attention, damage our customer relationships, reputation and brand, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs\nand banking and credit programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including payers, strategic partners and cloud service providers. These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. Like other global companies, we and businesses we interact with have experienced threats to data and systems, including from vandalism or theft of physical systems or media and from perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information, including credit card information, and cause system failures and disruptions.\nCompromises of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact that result in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, have in the past and could in the future adversely impact us. Any such compromise could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses. The risks associated with data security and cybersecurity incidents have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic given the increased reliance on remote work arrangements.\nWe are subject to payment-related and other financial services risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay™, and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which has made and could continue to make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we offer branded credit cards, money (wire) transfer services and sell prepaid debit, credit and gift cards at certain business units. These products and services require us to comply with global anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and damage to our reputation.\nFinancial and Accounting Risks\nWe have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.\nWe have outstanding debt and other financial obligations. As of August 31, 2021, we had approximately $9.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term debt. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes;\n•\nmaking it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing;\n•\nreducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions and making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and\n•\nexposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations and undrawn revolving credit facilities is at variable interest rates.\nWe may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. Incurrence of additional debt by us and changes in our operating performance could also adversely affect our credit ratings. Any actual or anticipated downgrade of our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, financial covenants, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.\nOur long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on funding from our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.\nThe Company is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and international subsidiaries, to pay dividends and meet its obligations. The Company’s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to the Company, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of the Company's common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of the Company, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to the Company by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries’ earnings and business considerations. Future dividends to the Company will be determined based on earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by its Board of Directors.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly based on seasonality and other factors.\nOur operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis, including increased variability during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. For instance, our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February), which falls during the holiday season, typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year. Other factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the impact and duration of COVID-19, the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; seasonality, including the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes or rates of change in payer reimbursement rates and terms; the timing and amount of periodic contractual reconciliation payments, fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges, including the performance of and impairment charges related to our equity method investments; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; market conditions, widespread looting or vandalism; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not place undue reliance on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.\nAs of August 31, 2021, we had $12.4 billion of goodwill and $9.9 billion of other intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. We determine fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. Definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt and equity, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization, whether due to COVID-19 or otherwise. There can be no assurance that impairments will not occur, and any impairment may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe operate or have equity method investments in several countries across the globe which expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses’ functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the British pound sterling, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency debt to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.\nWe could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.\nWe operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the UK, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plans’ assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nRisks from Changes in Public Policy and Other Legal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in the healthcare industry and regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the U.S. and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing, and these pressures could be further exacerbated if payer deficits or shortfalls increase due to COVID-19 or otherwise. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies and practices as well as applicable government regulations, including, for example, in connection with the federal 340B drug pricing program, could also significantly reduce our profitability.\nWe are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, including those contained in Note 11 Commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information. For example, in January 2019, Walgreen Co., on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and certain identified affiliates, resolved matters regarding certain dispensing practices by entering into, among other things, a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a five-year term and provides that Walgreen Co. shall, among other things, continue the compliance program it created to address compliance with federal health care program requirements, provide annual certifications of compliance and provide training and education for certain covered employees. Failure to meet the Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations could have material adverse consequences for us, including reputational harm and monetary penalties for each instance of non-compliance. In addition, in the event of a breach or deliberate violation of the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs, or subjected to other significant penalties, which could seriously harm our results of operations, liquidity and financial results.\nLegal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several\nyears. For example, we are a defendant in numerous litigation proceedings relating to opioid matters, including federal multidistrict litigation that consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes, and others, as well as numerous lawsuits brought in state courts. Additionally, the Company has received from the Department of Justice and the Attorney Generals of numerous states subpoenas, civil investigative demands and/or other requests concerning opioid matters. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. See Note 11 Commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nThe Company’s financial results may also be adversely affected by the litigation and other legal proceedings of companies in which it has an equity method investment. For example, AmerisourceBergen is involved in litigation and legal proceeding, including those relating to opioid matters. Any unfavorable outcome or settlement related to these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.\nLike other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. There continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities of, and increased litigation regarding business, compliance and reporting practices of the Company and other industry participants. As a result, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. In addition, under the qui tam or “whistleblower” provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of “false” claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management’s attention and resources.\nA significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.\nWe operate in complex, highly regulated environments around the world and could be materially and adversely affected by changes to applicable legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing, billing practices, utilization and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, each of which continues to evolve, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the U.S., the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including\nthe ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party’s intellectual property rights.\nChanges in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S. and the National Health Service in the UK; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and brand, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.\nWe are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and economic and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the UK Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. Violations of these laws and regulations or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws may subject us to penalties, sanctions, including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.\nWe could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labeling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, including through services provided by third-party health care providers, we are also exposed to risks relating to the products and services we offer. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us and mandatory or voluntary product recalls may apply to us with respect to any of the retail products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide, particularly with regard to our private branded products that are not available from other retailers. For example, from time to time, the FDA issues statements alerting patients that products in our supply chain may contain impurities or harmful substances, and claims relating to the sale or distribution of such products may be asserted against us or arise from these statements. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities or third-party healthcare providers that we do business with, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.\nAs a large corporation with operations in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions, from time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. For example, the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December 2017 represented a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code that impacted our U.S. federal income tax position. There can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results\nof operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nTax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The ultimate tax determination may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our results of operations in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws (such as the recent U.S. tax legislation), rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations; or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Structure and Organization\nCertain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of August 31, Stefano Pessina, our Executive Chairman (together with his affiliates, the “SP Investors”), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 16.9% of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors’ significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in the Company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. In addition, issuances or sales of our common stock (or the exercise of related registration rights), including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors and certain other former Alliance Boots stockholders, are subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement (as defined herein). As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nConflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.\nConflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the shareholders agreement (the “Company Shareholders Agreement”) with certain SP Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Chairman, indirectly controls Alliance Santé Participations S.A. (“ASP”), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his partner Ornella Barra, our Chief Operating Officer, International serve as directors of ASP. There are other arrangements between affiliates of Mr. Pessina and the Company, with required disclosures included in the Company’s annual proxy statement, including with respect to Alliance Healthcare Italia SpA, which is an entity indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Pessina and in which the Company has an indirect 9% interest, which operates Boots branded stores in Italy. Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, or similar issues could arise in connection with these or other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties’ conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transactions approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of\nthe DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.\nUnder the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board’s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).\nWhile these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. Activity under this program was suspended in July 2020 and there can be no assurance whether or when activity will resume. If resumed, the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Company’s business and reportable segments in Item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.\nCertain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for each of the periods presented.\nINTRODUCTION AND SEGMENTS\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries is a global leader in retail pharmacy. Its operations are conducted through two reportable segments:\n•\nUnited States; and\n•\nInternational\nSee Note 17 Segment reporting and Note 18 Sales, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nFACTORS, TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY\nThe Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade tariffs, including trade relations between the U.S. and China, and international relations, including the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects, and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates.\nSpecialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. To better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market, in March 2017, we and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. Certain clients of our joint venture were and are not obligated to contract through our joint venture, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving our joint venture. Over the last year, certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through our joint venture which will impact gross sales. However, considering the relatively low margin nature of this business, we do not anticipate this having a material impact on operating income.\nThese and other factors can affect the Company’s operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19 has severely impacted, and may continue to impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 has created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in every region in which we operate, which has adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets experienced, and may again experience, volatility. Policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, temporary closure or reduced hours of operation of certain store locations in the U.S., the UK and other countries, reduced customer traffic and sales in our retail pharmacies and the adoption of work-from-home policies.\nIn response to COVID-19, various domestic and foreign federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives have been implemented that are designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has assessed and will continue to assess the impact of these governmental actions on the Company. The Company has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S. and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and if available, may continue to do so in the future.\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2021, the Company experienced certain adverse impacts of COVID-19. Sales were negatively impacted within the United States segment driven by low level of flu incidences as social distancing measures continued to remain in place across the U.S. Sales were also negatively impacted within the International segment, which reflected a reduction in footfall in Boots UK stores as a second national lockdown was declared in November 2020. The Company took measures to keep stores open, incurring incremental selling, general and administrative expenses including higher employee costs and store expenses related to social distancing and incremental cleaning, COVID-19 drive-through testing sites expenses, safeguarding store environments as well as preparing for the rollout of mass vaccinations. In the beginning of fiscal 2021, the Company also took certain actions to partly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through cost containment across the Company including temporary store closures and decreasing store hours and reducing rent at some locations. The Company's operating income was significantly and adversely impacted during the first half of fiscal 2021 as a result of COVID-19.\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company experienced sequential improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2021 as sales and comparable scripts were positively impacted within the United States segment due to the acceleration of COVID-19 vaccination rollout and a recovery in retail. The United States segment’s operating income was also positively impacted as a result of COVID-19 vaccines administered, net of incremental labor and other costs related to the vaccination program. The International segment experienced a rebound in retail sales and operating income during the second half of fiscal 2021 resulting from the phased reopening of the UK high street and less severe COVID-19 restrictions. However, despite these improvements during the second half of fiscal 2021, store footfall in the UK remained below pre-COVID-19 levels.\nThe Company has taken a number of proactive actions consistent with regulatory directives, such as digital 'order ahead' drive-through offering services with an increased range of products available for drive-through pick-up and curbside collection and put in place new delivery options available nationwide in the U.S during fiscal 2021. To continue to work with customers and manage operations through the pandemic, the Company launched a new COVID-19 testing program for businesses in fiscal 2020. As of August 31, 2021, the Company has administered 12.9 million COVID-19 tests in the U.S. as part of its Test & Protect efforts. In the International segment, Boots administered more than 3.7 million COVID-19 tests in the UK, mostly undertaken in partnership with the National Health Service (“NHS”). Boots UK has a growing private test offering with several at home and in-store tests available, in addition to testing partnerships with several major airlines.\nThe Company has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the U.S. government to help administer COVID-19 vaccines to high priority groups, including long-term care facility residents and staff. The United States segment also expanded vaccination models to ensure convenient access, including same-day and walk-in appointments, mobile clinics, employer partnerships and extended hours. As of August 31, 2021, the United States segment had administered approximately 34.6 million COVID-19 vaccinations, including 13.5 million in the three months ended August 31, 2021.\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and could result in additional mandates and directives, including revisions thereto, from foreign, federal, state, county and city authorities throughout the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time thereafter. The impact on the U.S. and global economies and consumer, customer and health care utilization patterns depends upon the evolving factors and future developments related to COVID-19. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact on the Company, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse.\nThe Company’s current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements” and in Item 1A, Risk factors.\nSTRATEGIC UPDATE\nIn October 2021, the Company announced the launch of its new healthcare strategy. The Company plans to become a leading provider of local clinical care services by leveraging its consumer-centric technology and pharmacy network to deliver value-based care. The Company also plans to continue to transform its core pharmacy and retail business. The Company’s goal is to provide better consumer experiences, improve health outcomes and lower costs. At the center of the Company’s healthcare strategy is Walgreens Health, a technology-enabled care model powered by a nationally scaled, locally delivered healthcare\nplatform. To advance its strategy, the Company announced majority investments in Village Practice Management Company, LLC (“VillageMD”) and CareCentrix, which it believes will strengthen Walgreens Health capabilities in primary care, post-acute care and home care.\nSee Note 21. Subsequent events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein for further information.\nRECENT TRANSACTIONS\nPharmaceutical Wholesale Transaction\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale. See Item 1. Business. Recent Transactions for further details on the Alliance Healthcare Sale.\nThe Disposal Group in the Alliance Healthcare Sale met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Therefore, the related assets, liabilities and operating results of the Disposal Group are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nSee Note 2 Discontinued operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nVillageMD investment\nIn July 2020, the Company and VillageMD announced an expansion of their partnership and the intent to open 500 to 700 “Village Medical at Walgreens” physician-led primary care clinics over a five-year period. This expanded partnership was supported by the Company’s investment in VillageMD over three years of $1.0 billion in equity and convertible debt, which included an initial $250 million equity investment.\nOn January 6, 2021, the Company and VillageMD announced the acceleration of the Company's investment in VillageMD. The Company completed the remaining $750 million investment during the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, which will support the opening of 600 to 700 clinics in more than 30 U.S. markets over a four-year period, with the intent to build hundreds more thereafter.\nThe Company held approximately 22% ownership interest in VillageMD as of August 31, 2021 and accounted for it using the equity method of accounting. It was anticipated, assuming full conversion of the debt, that the Company would hold approximately 30% ownership interest in VillageMD upon conversion.\nOn October 14, 2021 the Company announced that it has agreed to make an additional $5.2 billion investment in VillageMD to advance its strategic position in the delivery of value-based primary care. The incremental investment increases the Company’s ownership stake in VillageMD to approximately 63% from approximately 30% on a fully diluted basis, and increases the number of co-located clinics from 600 primary care clinics to 1,000 by the year 2027. The investment will be comprised of $4.0 billion in cash, to be paid by the Company to VillageMD at the closing of the transaction, and a promissory note in the principal amount of $1.2 billion to VillageMD at the closing of the transaction. The Company expects to fund the cash portion of the investment through a combination of cash on hand and available credit facilities\nSee Note 21. Subsequent events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein for further information.\niA acquisition\nOn December 29, 2020, the Company acquired a majority equity interest in Innovation Associates, Inc. (“iA”) for a cash consideration of $451 million. iA is a leading-edge provider of software enabled automation solutions for retail, hospital, federal healthcare and mail-order pharmacy markets. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination and consolidates iA within the United States segment in its financial statements.\nPharmaceutical Wholesale business in Germany\nOn November 1, 2020, the Company and McKesson Corporation closed a transaction to form a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany, as part of a strategic alliance. The Company owns a 70% controlling equity interest in the combined business which is consolidated by the Company and reported within the International segment in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of $296 million consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in the combined business. See Note 3 Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.\nTRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nOn December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the “Transformational Cost Management Program”). At the end of fiscal 2021, the Company had delivered this annual cost savings goal.\nBuilding on the successful implementation of the Transformational Cost Management Program to date and as part of the Company's strategic realignment to create even greater focus on the Company’s core business, on October 12, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an expansion and extension of the Transformational Cost Management Program through the end of fiscal 2024. The expanded Transformational Cost Management Program is expected to deliver incremental savings from existing programs and a comprehensive funnel of new initiatives which are intended to improve operating effectiveness and better position the core business for the future. The expansion of the program reflects further strategic initiatives to optimize real estate, implement a global business and centralized services model, as well as leverage technology and new business models to streamline processes across the organization. As a result, the Company is increasing its annual savings target to $3.3 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2024.\nThe Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Company’s information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Company’s global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Company’s segments includes activities such as optimization of stores. As a result of the expanded program, the Company now plans to reduce its presence by up to 150 Boots stores in the UK and up to 150 stores in the United States over the next three years, which are incremental to the previously planned reduction of approximately 200 Boots stores in the UK and approximately 250 stores in the United States.\nThe Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, of which $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. The Company estimates that approximately 85% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program represent current or future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation and lease and other real estate payments.\nThe Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as follows:\n1\nIncludes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.\n2\nPrimarily related to store closures and other asset impairments.\nIn addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019. See Note 1 Summary of major accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements additional information.\nSince the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to August 31, 2021, the Company has recognized aggregate cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.5 billion, of which $1.3 billion is recorded as exit and disposal activities. See Note 4 Exit and disposal activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 below for additional information. These charges included $353 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs, $252 million in asset impairments, $513 million in employee severance and business transition costs, $163 million of information technology transformation and other exit costs, and $200 million in other information technology costs.\nCosts under the Transformational Cost Management Program, which were primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and included in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively were as follows (in millions):\nTransformational Cost Management Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.\nThe amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See “cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements” below.\nSTORE OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the “Store Optimization Program”) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the Company’s United States segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The Company closed 769 stores and related assets. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nCosts related to Store Optimization Program for the twelve months ended August 2020 were $22 million for lease obligation and other real estate costs and $31 million for employee severance and other exit costs, respectively. The liabilities related to Store Optimization Program as of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 were not material.\nINVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN\nAs of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively, the Company owned 58,854,867 and 56,854,867 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock, representing approximately 28.5% and 27.9% of its outstanding common stock based on the share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe Company has a shareholders agreement with AmerisourceBergen, which was most recently amended and restated in connection with the Alliance Healthcare Sale (the “A&R Shareholders Agreement”). Pursuant to the A&R Shareholders Agreement, the Company has designated one member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The Company is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market, and thereafter to designate another member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.\nThe Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the investment classified within the operating income of the Company’s United States segment. During the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, the Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,139 million, which included a loss of $1,373 million recognized during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses were primarily due to AmerisourceBergen's recognition of a $5.6 billion, net of tax charge related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three month period ended September 30, 2020.\nAs discussed above in Item 1, Recent Transactions, on June 1, 2021 the Company completed the previously announced Alliance Healthcare Sale per the Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen. See Note 2 Discontinued operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 below for additional information.\nThe financial performance of AmerisourceBergen will impact the Company’s results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see Part I. Item 1. Business “Relationship with AmerisourceBergen” and Note 6 Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following table presents certain key financial statistics for the Company for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n1\nSee “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nNM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following information summarizes our results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2021, the Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale, pursuant to which the Disposal Group is reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Company also eliminated the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment and aligned into two reportable segments: United States and International, as further described below.\nNet earnings from continuing operations fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nFiscal 2021 net earnings attributable to the Company was $2.0 billion compared to $180 million for the prior year period. Diluted net earnings per share was $2.30 compared to $0.20 for the prior year period. The increase in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share are primarily due to $2.0 billion non-cash impairment charges in the International segment, related to goodwill and intangible assets in the prior year period, earnings related to the Company's equity method investee HC Group Holdings I, LLC (“HC Group Holdings”) and gain on partial sale of ownership interest in Option Care Health by the Company's equity method investee HC Group Holdings, partially offset by equity losses in AmerisourceBergen during the three months ended November 30, 2020. Diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.\nOther income for fiscal 2021 was $558 million compared to $77 million for fiscal 2020. The increase in other income is mainly due to a partial sale of ownership interest in Option Care Health by the Company's equity method investee HC Group Holdings.\nNet Interest expense was $905 million and $613 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in interest expense included $414 million related to the early extinguishment of debt related to the Company's cash tender offer to partially purchase and retire $3.3 billion of long-term debt in advance of its maturity.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 33.4% and 76.0%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to prior year non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and the discrete tax effect of equity losses in AmerisourceBergen, partially offset by the tax effect of equity earnings of HC Group Holdings.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to the Company in fiscal 2021 increased 12.8 percent to $4.3 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2021 increased 14.6 percent to $4.91 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both positively impacted by 0.9 percentage points as a result of currency translation.\nExcluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2021 primarily reflects increased adjusted operating income across the United States and International segments, and cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nNet earnings from continuing operations fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nFiscal 2020 net earnings attributable to the Company decreased 95.3 percent to $180 million, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 95.1 percent to $0.20 compared with the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects third quarter non-cash impairment charges, adverse COVID-19 impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit, and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from Transformational Cost Management Program. Diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.\nOther income for fiscal 2020 was $77 million compared to $243 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease primarily reflects gains resulting from the termination of the option granted to Rite Aid to become a member of the Company’s group purchasing organization in fiscal 2019.\nNet interest expense was $613 million and $650 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 76.0% and 13.2%, respectively. The net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to third quarter fiscal 2020 non-tax deductible impairment charges and deferred tax impact of the UK rate change.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to the Company in fiscal 2020 decreased 27.0 percent to $3.8 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2020 decreased 23.5 percent to $4.28 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 8.7 and 9.1 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.\nExcluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to COVID-19 adverse impacts, lower U.S. pharmacy gross profit and year on year bonus changes partially offset by savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT\nIn fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company eliminated the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment and aligned into two reportable segments: United States and International. The following information summarizes our results of operations by segment for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.\nUnited States\nThe Company's United States segment includes the Walgreens business which includes the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, and mail and central specialty pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n1\nSee “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n2\nIncludes vaccinations, including COVID-19.\n3\nIncludes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.\n4\nComparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\nSales fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nThe United States segment’s sales for fiscal 2021 increased by 4.0% to $112.0 billion. Comparable sales increased by 5.1% in fiscal 2021.\nPharmacy sales increased by 5.5% in fiscal 2021 and represented 75.8% of the segment’s sales. The increase in fiscal 2021 is due to higher brand inflation and favorable COVID-19 vaccines and testing. In fiscal 2020, pharmacy sales increased 4.3% and represented 74.7% of the segment’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 6.7% in fiscal 2021 compared to an increase of 3.2% in fiscal 2020. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 0.5% in fiscal 2021 compared to a reduction of 2.4% in fiscal 2020. The effect of generics on segment sales was a reduction of 0.4% in fiscal 2021 compared to a reduction of 1.7% for fiscal 2020. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.4% of prescription sales for fiscal 2021 compared to 97.2% for fiscal 2020. The total number of prescriptions (including vaccinations) filled in fiscal 2021 was 827.5 million compared to 818.0 million in fiscal 2020. Prescriptions (including vaccinations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,210.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 1,165.3 million in fiscal 2020.\nRetail sales decreased by 0.4% in fiscal 2021 and were 24.2% of the segment’s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2020 retail sales decreased by 0.4% and comprised 25.3% of the segment’s sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.2% in fiscal 2021 and increased 1.6% in fiscal 2020. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by health & wellness, including favorable vitamins and at-home COVID-19 tests, and beauty categories partially offset by the continued de-emphasis of tobacco.\nOperating income fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nThe United States segment’s operating income for fiscal 2021 decreased 22.9% to $2.6 billion. The decrease was primarily due to the Company's share of equity loss in AmerisourceBergen and pharmacy reimbursement pressure, partially offset by COVID-19 vaccines and testing, and savings related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program.\nGross margin was 21.2% in fiscal 2021 compared to 20.7% in fiscal 2020. Gross margin was positively impacted in fiscal 2021 by pharmacy margins, primarily due to COVID-19 vaccines and testing. The increase in pharmacy margins was partially offset by reimbursement pressure.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat at 17.9% in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Savings related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program were offset by incremental COVID-19 related costs, mainly related to the vaccination program, as well as higher growth investments.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nUnited States segment’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2021 increased 5.4% to $5.0 billion. The increase was primarily due to COVID-19 vaccines and testing, savings related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program and retail performance, partially offset by pharmacy reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 related costs.\nSee “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe United States segment’s sales for fiscal 2020 increased by 3.0% to $107.7 billion. Comparable sales increased by 2.8% in fiscal 2020.\nPharmacy sales increased by 4.3% in fiscal 2020 and represented 74.7% of the segment’s sales. The increase in fiscal 2020 was due to higher brand inflation and growth in specialty sales. In fiscal 2019, pharmacy sales increased 8.6% and represented 73.8% of the segment’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 3.2% in fiscal 2020 compared to an increase of 4.0% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 2.4% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 1.2% in fiscal 2019. The effect of generics on segment sales was a reduction of 1.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to a reduction of 0.8% for fiscal 2019. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.2% of prescription sales for fiscal 2020 compared to 97.1% for fiscal 2019. The total number of prescriptions (including vaccinations) filled in fiscal 2020 was 818.0 million compared to 843.7 million in fiscal 2019. Prescriptions (including vaccinations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,165.3 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 1,150.1 million in fiscal 2019.\nRetail sales decreased by 0.4% in fiscal 2020 and were 25.3% of the segment’s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2019 retail sales were flat and comprised 26.2% of the segment’s sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.6% in fiscal 2020 and decreased 2.4% in fiscal 2019. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by health & wellness, including a favorable cough cold and flu season and personal care categories partially offset by the continued de-emphasis of tobacco.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe United States segment’s operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 26.0% to $3.3 billion. The decrease was primarily due to U.S pharmacy reimbursement pressure and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nGross margin was 20.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to 22.6% in fiscal 2019. Gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 by pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 17.9% in fiscal 2020 compared to 18.5% in fiscal 2019. As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower in fiscal 2020 primarily due to savings related to the Transformational Cost Management Program and gains on sale-leaseback transactions in fiscal 2020, partially offset by costs related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program and year-on-year bonus impact.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe United States segment’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 18.9% to $4.8 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower pharmacy margins, which were negatively impacted by reimbursement pressure, and COVID-19 adverse impacts partially offset by a reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nSee “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nInternational\nThe Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and the Company's pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.\nThe International segment operates in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso and therefore the segment’s results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See Item 3, “Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk”, for further information on currency risk.\nThe Company presents certain information related to operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See “--Non-GAAP Measures.”\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n1\nSee “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\n2\nComparable sales in constant currency are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. Comparable sales in constant currency exclude wholesale sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively. Comparable retail sales in constant currency for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\nNM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases/decreases when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.\nSales fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nThe International segment’s sales for fiscal 2021 increase\nd 43.6%\nto $20.5 billion. The favorable impact of currency translation on sales was 9.5 p\nercentage points. C\nomparable sales in constant currency, which excludes sales from the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale combined business in Germany, increase\nd 3.9 percent mainly due to higher sales in Boots UK as well as higher sales in Latin America and Ireland\n. Following the adverse impact of COVID-19 restrictions in the UK during the first half of the year, sales in the second half recovered, reflecting increased store foot traffic.\nPharmacy sales increase\nd 8.7%\nin fiscal 2021 and represented 18.6% of the segment’s sales. The favorable impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 6.8 percentage\npoints.\nComparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 6.7 percent primarily in the UK due to stronger pharmacy services (notably COVID-19 testing) and favorable National Health Service (\"NHS\") reimbursement levels, partially offset by lower prescription volume in the UK. In addition, Latin America showed strong pharmacy volume growth.\nRetail sales increase\nd\n5.5%\nfor fiscal 2021 and represented 30.4%\nof the segment’s sales. The favorable\nimpact of currency translation on retail sales was 6.5 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency increase\nd 2.0 percent\nreflecting higher retail sales in the UK and Ireland, including a recovery during the second half of the year, as COVID-19 restrictions eased.\nOperating income fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nThe International segment’s operating income for fiscal 2021 was $227 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.1 billion in fiscal 2020. Operating income was favorably impacted by\n1.0\npercentage points ($21 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in operating income was primarily in the UK, due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit in the prior fiscal year, as well as the recovery in the UK in the second half of the year following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions supported by operational improvements.\nGross profit increased 14.7% in fiscal 2021. Gross profit was favorably impacted by 7.3 percentage points ($277 million) of currency translation. The remaining increase was primarily due to incremental gross profit associated with the formation of the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale combined business in Germany, higher gross profit in Boots UK pharmacy services together with pharmacy growth in Latin America and volume growth in Ireland, partially offset by the impact of lower UK store foot traffic compared to the prior fiscal year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decrease\nd\n30.1% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Expenses were adversely\ni\nmpacted by 4.4 percentage points ($256 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was almost entirely due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit in the prior fiscal year. Incremental selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the formation of the Company's combined business in Germany were largely offset by cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 20.0% in fiscal 2021, compared to 41.1% in the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nThe International segment’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2021 increased $309 million to $466 million. Adjusted operating income was positively impacted by 17.9 percentage points ($28 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to sales growth in the UK during the second half of the year, supported by operational improvements in a recovering UK market. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nSales fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe International segment’s sales for fiscal 2020 decreased 8.1% to $14.3 billion. The negative impact of currency translation on sales was 1.5 percentage points. Comparable sales in constant currency decreased 8.8% mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK, driven by a reduction in store foot traffic due to the impact of COVID-19.\nPharmacy sales decreased 4.1% in fiscal 2020 and represented 24.5% of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 2.2 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency were flat as favorable National Health Service reimbursement levels mitigated the impact of lower prescription volume and reduced demand for services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Boots UK.\nRetail sales decreased 17.8% for fiscal 2020 and represented 41.3% of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on retail sales was 0.8 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency decreased 13.9% reflecting lower Boots UK retail sales, as footfall in stores in the second half of the year was significantly reduced due to COVID-19, particularly in major high street, train station and airport locations.\nOperating income fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe International segment’s operating loss for fiscal 2020 was $2.1 billion, compared to an operating income of $448 million in fiscal 2019. Operating income was positively\ni\nmpacted by 2.3 percentage points ($10 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in operating income was primarily in the UK, due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit and lower gross profit reflecting lower sales from COVID-19 restrictions in Boots UK and Opticians.\nGross profit decreased 16.9% in fiscal 2020. Gross profit was negatively impacted by 1.1 percentage points ($51 million) of currency translation. The remaining decrease was mainly due to lower retail sales in Boots UK and Opticians, higher fulfillment costs and lower supplier contributions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 43.3 percent from fiscal 2019. Expenses were positively impacted by 1.5 percentage points ($61 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was almost entirely due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the Boots reporting unit partially offset by short term cost mitigation initiatives. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 41.1% in fiscal 2020, compared to 26.3% in the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019\nThe International segment’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 79.4% to $157 million. Adjusted operating income was positively impacted by 1.1 percentage points ($9 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower retail sales in the UK including the impact of COVID-19. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures herein, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nOperating income to Adjusted operating income by segments\nNet Earnings to Adjusted net earnings & Earnings per share to Adjusted Earnings per share\nThe Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company’s long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company’s dividend policy to set forth the Company’s current intention to increase its dividend each year.\nThe Company’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability.\nThe Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements and current cash and investment balances. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Company's foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. See Part II. Item 7A, Qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $1.3 billion (including $0.2 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2021, compared to $0.7 billion (including $0.4 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2020. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds.\nOn August 17, 2021, the Company provided notice to the Trustee and the Holders of its 3.3% notes due 2021 issued by the Company on November 18, 2014 that it will redeem in full the $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes on September 18, 2021. These notes were redeemed in full as of that date. The Company has also announced its intention to make cash investments aggregating approximately $5.3 billion for certain acquisitions. Additionally, these acquisitions include certain put options which may be exercised in the future. The Company currently expects the incremental investment resulting from the exercise of the put options in future could be between approximately $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion. See Note 21. Subsequent events, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein for further information.\nAs of August 31, 2021 the Company had an aggregate borrowing capacity of $7 billion including funds already drawn. At August 31, 2021, the Company had no guarantees outstanding and no amounts issued under letters of credit. For details of the Company’s debt instruments and its recent financing actions, see Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein.\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.6 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020 and $5.6 billion in fiscal 2019. The $0.1 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, is mainly due to higher cash inflows from trade accounts payable, net earnings, and inventory, partially offset by lower cash inflows from accounts receivable. Changes in trade accounts payable and inventory are mainly driven by working capital initiatives and timing of collections and payments. Changes in accounts receivable are mainly driven by timing of collections and payments.\nCash flows from investing activities\nNet cash provided by (used for) investing activities was $4.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $(1.3) billion in fiscal 2020 and $(2.3) billion in fiscal 2019. The increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by higher cash inflows from proceeds from sale of business and assets offset by investment and asset acquisitions. Proceeds from sale of business, net of cash in fiscal 2021 include net cash proceeds of $5.5 billion related to the disposition of Alliance Healthcare business. Proceeds from sale of assets in fiscal 2021 were $453 million compared to $90 million in fiscal 2020 and $117 million in fiscal 2019. Changes in proceeds from sale of assets in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by partial sale of ownership interest in Option Care Health by the Company's equity method investee HC Group Holdings. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2021 were $1.4 billion compared to $0.7 billion in fiscal 2020 and $0.7 billion in fiscal 2019. The increase in business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by the Company's acquisition of Innovation Associates and increased investment in\nVillageMD. Additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2021 included proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions of $856 million, compared to $724 million in fiscal 2020 and $3 million in fiscal 2019.\nCapital Expenditure\nCapital expenditure includes information technology projects and other growth initiatives. Additions to property, plant and equipment were as follows (in millions):\nCash flows from financing activities\nNet cash (used for) financing activities in fiscal 2021 was $(9.0) billion compared to $(4.6) billion in fiscal 2020 and $(3.0) billion in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2021 we recognized $12.7 billion in net proceeds from financing activities compared to $20.4 billion in fiscal 2020 and $12.4 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily from revolving facilities and commercial paper debt. In fiscal 2021, the Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale and used a portion of the Alliance Healthcare Sale proceeds to repay certain borrowings. In fiscal 2021 the Company made $15.3 billion in payments of debt primarily for revolving facilities and commercial paper debt and retirement of $3.7 billion of long term debt (including $0.4 billion of charges on early debt extinguishment) compared to payments of debt made primarily for revolving facilities and commercial paper debt of $21.4 billion in fiscal 2020 and $10.5 billion in fiscal 2019. See Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein for further information. The Company repurchased shares as part of the stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $0.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 and $4.2 billion in fiscal 2019. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $59 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $55 million in fiscal 2020 and $174 million in fiscal 2019. Cash dividends paid were $1.6 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2019.\nStock repurchase program\nIn June 2018, the Company authorized a stock repurchase program (the “June 2018 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of August 31, 2021. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company announced that it was suspending activities under the June 2018 stock repurchase program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from its equity incentive plans.\nThe Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws.\nDebt covenants\nEach of the Company’s credit facilities described above contains a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of August 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all such applicable covenants.\nCredit ratings\nAs of October 13, 2021, the credit ratings of Walgreens Boots Alliance were:\nIn assessing the Company’s credit strength, each rating agency considers various factors including the Company’s business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Company’s credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company’s debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nAmerisourceBergen relationship\nOn January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which AmerisourceBergen agreed to purchase the majority of the Company's Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the Company’s retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe for approximately $6.5 billion, comprised of $6.275 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock.\nAfter giving effect to the Alliance Healthcare Sale and as of August 31, 2021, the Company beneficially owns approximately 28.5% of AmerisourceBergen’s outstanding common stock, based on the share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Part I. Item 1. Business “Recent Transactions” above and Note 2 Discontinued operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 below for additional information.\nOn June 1, 2021 the Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale, for total consideration of $6.9 billion, which includes estimated cash consideration of $6.7 billion, subject to net working capital and net cash adjustments. The Company recorded a gain before currency translation adjustments of $1.1 billion and a net gain on disposal of $0.3 billion. The gain on sale was presented as part of results of the discontinued operations.\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1. See Note 6 Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 herein for further information.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe information set forth in Note 11 Commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:\nBusiness combinations\n–\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.\nFor intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future\nfinancial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.\nJudgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life.\nLeases -\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nThe lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company’s economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.\nThe Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.\nFinance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment\n– Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Company’s reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by COVID-19. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of COVID-19.\nAlthough the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of COVID-19, could have a significant impact on either\nthe fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. The Company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of COVID-19 and economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on Boots and Other international reporting units.\nThe Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.\nSee Note 7 Goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 for additional information.\nImpairment of long lived assets\n- The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Long-lived assets related to the Company’s retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.\nThe determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.\nCost of sales and inventory\n– Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.\nCost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method for the United States segment and on an average cost and first-in first-out (“FIFO”) basis for inventory in the International segment.\nEquity method investments\n– The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company’s ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.\nThe Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.\nPension and postretirement benefits\n– The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.\nIn determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate\nwould result in a decline of $443 million to the Company’s pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company’s pension expense by $26 million.\nThe Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.\nIncome taxes\n–The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIn determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the U.S. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee “new accounting pronouncements” within Note 1 Summary of major accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 below for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report and other documents that we file or furnish with the SEC contain forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These include, without limitation, any statements regarding the Company's future operations, financial or operating results, capital allocation, anticipated debt levels and ratios, future earnings, planned activities, anticipated growth, market opportunities, strategies, competition, and other expectations and targets for future periods.

    "text": "Interest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable-rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable-rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates, such as U.S treasury rates and commercial paper rates. From time to time, the Company uses interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed-rate versus floating-rate debt. Generally, under these swaps, the Company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.\nOn March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, issued an announcement on the future cessation or loss of representativeness of LIBOR benchmark settings currently\npublished by ICE Benchmark Administration. That announcement confirmed that LIBOR will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative after December 31, 2021 for all non-USD LIBOR reference rates, and for 1W and 2M USD LIBOR and after June 30, 2023 for other USD LIBOR reference rates.\nCertain of our credit facilities provide that, under certain circumstances set forth in such credit facilities, we and the administrative agent may amend the applicable credit facility to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate, giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in the U.S. market for alternative benchmarks. Such an alternative benchmark rate could include the secured overnight financing rate, also known as SOFR, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nInformation regarding the Company’s transactions are set forth in Note 9 Financial instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On August 31, 2021, the Company had no material long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British pound sterling and certain other foreign currencies, which may affect its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. The Company is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions).\nThe Company’s foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 1% change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would change the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives held as of August 31, 2021, by approximately $53 million. The foreign currency derivatives are intended to partially hedge anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\nEquity price risk\nChanges in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in Note 6 Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II. Item 8 below. See Part I. Item 1. Business “Investment in AmerisourceBergen” above."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.\nSummary of major accounting policies\nOrganization\nWalgreens Boots Alliance Inc., and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a global leader in retail pharmacy. Its operations are conducted through\ntwo\nreportable segments: United States and International. See Note 17 Segment reporting and Note 18 Sales, for further information.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. The Company uses the equity-method of accounting for equity investments in less than majority-owned companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experiences and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) has severely impacted the economies of the United States (“U.S.”), the United Kingdom (“UK”) and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s businesses, financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, as well as information regarding certain expected or potential impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ.\nThe impact of COVID-19, the influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, changes in laws and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Company’s operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years.\nOn January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, AmerisourceBergen agreed to purchase the majority of the Company's Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the Company’s retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe (“Disposal Group”) for approximately $\n6.5\nbillion, comprised of $\n6.275\nbillion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and\n2\nmillion shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (the “Alliance Healthcare Sale”). Alliance Healthcare’s investment in China and Italy and its operations in Germany were not included in the Disposal Group, and the Company's retail pharmacy international operations in The Netherlands, Norway and Lithuania were included in the Disposal Group. The Disposal Group met the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Therefore, the related assets, liabilities and operating results of the Disposal Group are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The majority of the Disposal Group was previously included in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Effective as of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company eliminated the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment and aligned into\ntwo\nreportable segments: United States and International. See Note 17 Segment reporting, for additional information on the segments. On June 1, 2021 the Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale.\nUnless otherwise specified, disclosures in these Consolidated Financial Statements reflect continuing operations only. Certain prior period data, primarily related to discontinued operations, have been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2 Discontinued operations, for further information.\nCertain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for all periods presented.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables, which generally settle within\none\nto\nseven\nbusiness days, of $\n146\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRestricted cash and other cash flows from operating activities\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestricted cash\nThe Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations.\nThe following represents a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets to total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, (in millions):\nOther cash flows from operating activities\nOther cash flows from operating activities of $(\n64\n) million for fiscal 2021 include asset impairment of $\n203\nmillion offset by gains on sales-leaseback transactions of $\n367\nmillion. Other cash flows from operating activities of $\n464\nmillion for fiscal 2020 include asset impairments of $\n462\nmillion offset by gains on sales-leaseback transactions of $\n308\nmillion. Other cash flows from operating activities of $\n302\nmillion for fiscal 2019 include asset impairments of $\n328\nmillion.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily consist of trade receivables due from customers, including amounts due from third-party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies). Trade receivables were $\n4.5\nbillion and $\n3.0\nbillion at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other accounts receivable balances, which consist primarily of receivables from vendors and manufacturers, including receivables from AmerisourceBergen (see Note 19 Related parties), were $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCharges for the Company’s expected credit losses are recognized based upon all available relevant information regarding the collectability of receivables, including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the short contractual life of the receivable.\nThe allowance for expected credit losses for trade receivables at August 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n53\nmillion and $\n26\nmillion, respectively.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.\nThe Company’s United States segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method was $\n6.2\nbillion and $\n6.4\nbillion at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At August 31, 2021 and 2020, United States segment inventory would have been greater by $\n3.3\nbillion and $\n3.3\nbillion, respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out (“FIFO”) cost and net realizable value.\nThe Company’s International segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the FIFO method.\nThe total carrying value of the inventory for International segment was $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n1.5\nbillion at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Leasehold improvements, equipment under finance lease and finance lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The majority of the Company’s fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s property, plant and equipment (in millions) and estimated useful lives (in years):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company capitalizes application development stage costs for internally developed software. These costs are amortized over a\nthree\nto\nten year\nperiod.\nAmortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $\n284\nmillion in fiscal 2021, $\n300\nmillion in fiscal 2020 and $\n260\nmillion in fiscal 2019. Unamortized costs were $\n1.9\nbillion and $\n1.6\nbillion at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property, plant and equipment including capitalized system development costs and software was $\n1.4\nbillion in fiscal 2021, $\n1.4\nbillion in fiscal 2020 and $\n1.4\nbillion in fiscal 2019.\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain retail stores, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, land and equipment. Initial terms for leased premises in the United States are typically\n15\nto\n25\nyears, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at\nfive-year\nintervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company’s economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.\nFinance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.\nSee Note 5 Leases, for further information.\nBusiness combinations\nThe Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets acquired\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand liabilities assumed requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. If the Company obtains new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value\nSee Note 7 Goodwill and other intangible assets, for additional disclosure regarding the Company’s intangible assets.\nEquity method investments\nThe Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company’s ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.\nThe Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.\nSee Note 6 Equity method investments, for further information.\nFinancial instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to market risks, including interest rate and currency risks, arising from operating and financing risks. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nDerivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values. When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies:\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same line item, generally interest expense, net.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings and is presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nCash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item.\nFor derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between\n80\n% and\n125\n% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.\nPension and postretirement benefits\nThe Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.\nThe Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The Company records the service cost component of net pension cost and net postretirement healthcare benefit cost in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company records all other net cost components of net pension cost and net postretirement benefit cost in other income (expense). The postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.\nSee Note 14 Retirement benefits, for further information.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\nThe Company presents non-controlling interest in temporary equity within its Consolidated Balance Sheets if it is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date on the option of the holder, or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the Company. The carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interest is equal to the greater of the carrying value of non-controlling interest adjusted each reporting period for income (or loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest as well as any applicable distributions made or the redemption value. Re-measurements to the redemption value of the redeemable non-controlling interest are recognized in additional paid in capital.\nThe redeemable noncontrolling interest balance as of August 31, 2021 was $\n319\nmillion primarily due to acquisitions during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021.\nSee Note 3 Acquisitions, for further details.\nNoncontrolling interests\nThe Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the portion of its earnings or loss for noncontrolling interest as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings\n.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCurrency\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAssets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are generally included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nCommitments and contingencies\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company’s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Management’s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management’s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.\nSee Note 11 Commitments and contingencies, for further information.\nRevenue recognition\nSales are recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring control of goods or services to the customer. Sales are reported on the gross amount billed to a customer less discounts if it has earned revenue as a principal from the sale of goods and services. Sales are reported on the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a vendor) if it has earned a commission or a fee as an agent.\nThe Company recognizes revenue, net of taxes and expected returns, at the time it sells merchandise or dispenses prescription drugs to the customer. The Company estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from third-party payers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies) for dispensing prescription drugs. The estimates are based on all available information including historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts. Wholesale revenue is recognized, net of taxes and expected returns, upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery.\nLoyalty programs and gift cards\nThe Company’s loyalty rewards programs represent a separate performance obligation and are accounted for using the deferred revenue approach. When goods are sold, the transaction price is allocated between goods sold and loyalty points awarded based upon the relative standalone selling price. The revenue allocated to the loyalty points is recognized upon redemption. Loyalty programs breakage is recognized as revenue based on the redemption pattern.\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as revenue until the card is redeemed. Gift card breakage (i.e., unused gift card) is recognized as revenue based on the redemption pattern.\nContract balances with customers\nThe Company recognizes contract liabilities to record the Company’s obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration, for example the Company’s myWalgreens and Boots Advantage\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCard loyalty programs. Under such programs, customers earn Walgreens Cash or reward points on purchases for redemption at a later date.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances.\nVendor allowances and supplier rebates\nVendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors’ products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors’ products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.\nRebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier’s products purchased by the Company.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters’ expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance.\nAdvertising costs\nAdvertising costs are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, if reimbursement represents a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, and expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $\n772\nmillion in fiscal 2021, $\n532\nmillion in fiscal 2020 and $\n582\nmillion in fiscal 2019.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Long-lived assets related to the Company’s retail operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.\nImpairment charges for definite-lived assets included in selling, general and administrative expenses were $\n182\nmillion, $\n401\nmillion and $\n163\nmillion for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\nThe determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.\nStock compensation plans\nStock based compensation is measured at fair value at the grant date. The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units to the Company’s non-employee directors, officers and employees. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the substantive service period.\nThe fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at\n100\npercent. If such goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any recognized compensation expense is reversed. See Note 13 Stock compensation plans, for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.\nInsurance\nThe Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers’ compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexpenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Company’s estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nThe Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nEarnings per share\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares.\nOutstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled\n17.2\nmillion,\n19.0\nmillion and\n14.9\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNew accounting pronouncements\nAdoption of new accounting pronouncements\nFinancial instrument\ns\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-03, Codification Improvement to Financial Instruments. This ASU improves and clarifies various financial instruments topics. The ASU includes seven different issues that describe the areas of improvement and the related amendments to GAAP, intended to make the standards easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nInvestments - equity securities\nIn April 2019, the “FASB” issued “ASU” 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Financial Instruments (Topic 825). This extensive ASU provides clarifications for three topics related to financial instruments accounting, some of which apply to the Company. For example, this ASU clarifies the disclosure requirements that apply to equity securities without a readily determinable fair value for which the measurement alternative is elected. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nCollaborative arrangement\ns\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808). This ASU clarifies the interaction between Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements, and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCompany adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nCompensation – retirement benefits – defined benefit plans\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement benefits (Topic 715-20). This ASU amends ASC 715 to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next year. The ASU also removes the disclosure requirements for the effects of a one-percentage-point change on the assumed health care costs and the effect of this change in rates on service cost, interest cost and the benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. The Company adopted the new standard effective August 31, 2021 and the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nFair value measurement\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). The ASU eliminates such disclosures as the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU adds new disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2020 on a retrospective basis and the adoption of this ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nFinancial instruments - credit losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326), which amends the Board’s guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The ASU adds to U.S. GAAP an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, which is known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. The CECL model applies to most debt instruments (other than those measured at fair value), trade and other receivables, financial guarantee contracts, and loan commitments. The Company adopted the new standard effective September 1, 2020, using a modified retrospective transition method, which requires a cumulative-effect adjustment, if any, to the opening balance of retained earnings to be recognized on the date of adoption with prior periods not restated. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nNew accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nReceivables - nonrefundable fees and others\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other. This ASU clarifies the accounting for the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium by giving consideration to securities which have multiple call dates. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 (fiscal 2022). The Company does not expect adoption will have any impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nEffects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU provides optional expedient and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (\"IBORs\") and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. The ASU provides companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. The FASB further issued ASU 2021-01 in January 2021, to clarify the scope of Topic 848. The ASU can be adopted no later than December 1, 2022 (fiscal 2023) with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption will have any material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nInvestments - equity securities; Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures; Derivatives and Hedging\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in this ASU clarify the interaction between the accounting for investments in equity securities, investment in equity method and certain derivatives instruments.\nThe ASU is expected to reduce diversity in practice and increase comparability of the accounting for these interactions. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 (fiscal 2022). The Company does not expect adoption will\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nhave any impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIncome taxes - simplifying the accounting for income taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740), which removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 (fiscal 2022), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption will have any material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nNote 2.\nDiscontinued operations\nOn January 6, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, AmerisourceBergen agreed to purchase the majority of the Company's Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the Company’s retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe (“Disposal Group”) for approximately $\n6.5\nbillion, comprised of $\n6.275\nbillion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and\n2\nmillion shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock (the “Alliance Healthcare Sale”). Alliance Healthcare’s investment in China and Italy and its operations in Germany were not included in the Disposal Group, and the Company's retail pharmacy international operations in The Netherlands, Norway and Lithuania were included in the Disposal Group.\nOn June 1, 2021 the Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale, for total consideration of $\n6.9\nbillion, which includes estimated cash consideration of $\n6.7\nbillion, subject to net working capital and net cash adjustments. The Company recorded a gain before currency translation adjustments of $\n1.1\nbillion and a net gain on disposal of $\n322\nmillion. The gain on sale was presented as part of results of the discontinued operations.\nThe following table shows the fair value of proceeds from the Alliance Healthcare Sale and net carrying value of the assets disposed. As of the date of this report, the Company had not finalized net working capital and net cash adjustments for discontinued operations and therefore proceeds and gain amounts presented are subject to further refinement and may result in changes.\n1\nIncludes base consideration of $\n6.275\nbillion adjusted for net working capital and net cash adjustments as set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement.\n2\nThe Company recorded insignificant amount of tax expense due to utilization of capital losses.\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company recorded a $\n98\nmillion receivable for purchase price consideration due from AmerisourceBergen that is subject to change upon the finalization of net working capital and net cash adjustments.\nThe assets and liabilities and operating results of the Disposal Group are reported as discontinued operations, for all periods presented, as the disposition reflects a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. The Company classified assets and liabilities of the Disposal Group as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Depreciation and amortization ceased on assets classified as held for sale. The Company allocated goodwill to the Disposal Group using relative fair value of the Disposal Group and businesses retained within the respective reporting units.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

Innovation Associates, Inc. is a leading-edge provider of software enabled automation solutions for retail, hospital and federal healthcare and mail-order pharmacy markets. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination and consolidates Innovation Associates, Inc. within the United States segment in its financial statements. Considering the contractual terms related to the noncontrolling interest, it is classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The goodwill arising from this acquisition reflects the expected operational synergies and cost savings to be derived as a result of this acquisition.\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company has completed the analysis to determine the fair value of the consideration paid or to assign fair values to all tangible and intangible assets acquired, and therefore the purchase price allocation has been completed.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPro forma net earnings and sales of the Company, assuming the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported. The acquisition did not have a material impact on net earnings or sales of the Company for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021.\nPharmaceutical Wholesale business in Germany\nOn November 1, 2020, the Company and McKesson Corporation closed a transaction to form a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany, as part of a strategic alliance. The Company owns a\n70\n% controlling equity interest in the combined business which is consolidated by the Company and reported within the International segment in its financial statements. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination involving noncash purchase consideration of $\n296\nmillion consisting of the issuance of an equity interest in the combined business.\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company has completed the analysis to determine the fair value of the consideration paid or to assign fair values to all tangible and intangible assets acquired, and therefore the purchase price allocation has been completed.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration for the acquisition and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the transaction (in millions):\nThe Company recognized a noncontrolling interest of $\n175\nmillion based on the Company's proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the combined business. The difference between the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration in the business combination is recognized as additional paid in capital. Considering the contractual terms related to the noncontrolling interest, it is classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table represents supplemental pro forma consolidated sales for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period.\nThe pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Company's results would have been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or results which may occur in the future.\nActual sales for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings are as follows:\nPro forma net earnings of the Company, assuming the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported.\nOther acquisitions\nThe Company acquired certain prescription files and related pharmacy inventory primarily in the U.S. for the aggregate purchase price of $\n108\nmillion and $\n258\nmillion during the fiscal year ended 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 4.\nExit and disposal activities\nTransformational Cost Management Program\nOn December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected to deliver in excess of $\n2.0\nbillion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the “Transformational Cost Management Program”). At the end of fiscal 2021, the Company had delivered this annual cost savings goal.\nBuilding on the successful implementation of the Transformational Cost Management Program to date and as part of the Company's strategic realignment to create even greater focus on the Company’s core business, on October 12, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an expansion and extension of the Transformational Cost Management Program through the end of fiscal 2024. The expanded Transformational Cost Management Program is expected to deliver incremental savings from existing programs and a comprehensive funnel of new initiatives which are intended to improve operating effectiveness and better position the core business for the future. The expansion of the program reflects further strategic initiatives to optimize real estate, implement a global business and centralized services model, as well as leverage technology and new business models to streamline processes across the organization. As a result, the Company is increasing its annual savings target to $\n3.3\nbillion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2024.\nThe Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Company’s information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program. The actions under the Transformational Cost Management Program focus on all reportable segments and the Company’s global functions. Divisional optimization within each of the Company’s segments includes activities such as optimization of stores. As a result of the expanded program, the Company now plans to reduce its presence by up to\n150\nBoots stores in the UK and up to\n150\nstores in the United States over the next three years which are incremental to the previously planned reductions of approximately\n200\nBoots stores in the UK and approximately\n250\nstores in the United States.\nThe Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $\n3.6\nbillion to $\n3.9\nbillion, of which $\n3.3\nbillion to $\n3.6\nbillion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. In addition to these impacts, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $\n508\nmillion of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019. See Note 1 Summary of major accounting policies, for additional information.\nSince the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to August 31, 2021, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $\n1.3\nbillion, which were primarily recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges included $\n353\nmillion related to lease obligations and other real estate costs, $\n252\nmillion in asset impairments, $\n513\nmillion in employee severance and business transition costs and $\n163\nmillion of information technology transformation and other exit costs.\nCosts related to exit and disposal activities under the Transformational Cost Management Program for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were as follows (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe changes in liabilities and assets related to the exit and disposal activities under Transformational Cost Management Program include the following (in millions):\nStore Optimization Program\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the “Store Optimization Program”) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately\n600\nstores and related assets within the Company’s United States segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The Company closed\n769\nstores and related assets. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nCosts related to Store Optimization Program for the twelve months ended August 2020 were $\n22\nmillion for lease obligation and other real estate costs and $\n31\nmillion for employee severance and other exit costs, respectively. The liabilities related to Store Optimization Program as of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020 were not material.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

As of August 31, 2021, the Company has designated one member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The Company accounts for its\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nequity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the Company’s investment being classified within the operating income of its United States segment. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, the Company accounts for this equity method investment on a financial reporting lag of two months. Equity earnings (loss) from AmerisourceBergen are reported as a separate line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the twelve months ended August 31, 2021, the Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $\n1,139\nmillion. These equity losses were primarily due to AmerisourceBergen's recognition of $\n5.6\nbillion, net of tax charge related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020.\nThe Level 1 fair market value of the Company’s equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at August 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n7.2\nbillion and $\n5.5\nbillion, respectively. As of August 31, 2021, the carrying value of Company’s investment in AmerisourceBergen exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by $\n4.4\nbillion. This premium of $\n4.4\nbillion was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Company’s equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference was primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets.\nOther investments\nThe Company’s other equity method investments include its investments in the U.S. which include the Company's investment in HC Group Holdings I, LLC (“HC Group Holdings”) which owns equity interest in Option Care Health, Village Practice Management Company, LLC (“VillageMD”), BrightSpring Health Services (previously PharMerica Corporation) and Shields Health Solutions and the Company's investments in China through Sinopharm Medicine Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd, Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Company Limited.\nThe Company reported $\n627\nmillion, $\n31\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion of post-tax equity earnings from other equity method investments, for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $\n290\nmillion in Other income due to a partial sale of ownership interest in Option Care Health by the Company's equity method investee HC Group Holdings. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, as a result of partial sales of ownership interest in Option Care Health, our equity method investee HC Group Holdings lost the ability to control Option Care Health and, therefore, deconsolidated Option Care Health in its financial statements. As a result of this deconsolidation, HC Group Holdings recognized a gain of $\n1.2\nbillion and the Company recorded its share of equity earnings in HC Group Holdings $\n576\nmillion during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, respectively, in post tax earnings from other equity method investments.\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company made an additional investment of $\n750\nmillion in VillageMD, $\n250\nmillion of which is recorded as an equity method investment and $\n500\nmillion of which is recorded as an investment in convertible debt securities within Other non-current assets.

Item 8 herein for further information.\nSummarized financial information\nSummarized financial information for the Company’s equity method investments in aggregate is as follows:\nBalance sheet (in millions)\n1\nShareholders’ equity at August 31, 2021 and 2020 includes\n$\n646\nmillion and $\n387\nmillion, respectively, related to noncontrolling interests.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStatements of earnings (in millions)\nThe summarized financial information for equity method investments has been included on an aggregated basis for all investments as reported at the end of each fiscal year end.\nNote 7.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value.\nBased on the annual evaluation as of the June 1, 2021 valuation date, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately\n18\n% to approximately\n195\n%. Boots reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately\n18\n%, compared to a nominal amount as of June 1, 2020, mainly due to decline in the carrying amounts of net assets of the reporting unit. Other international reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its carrying value by approximately\n29\n% compared to\n4\n% as of June 1, 2020, due to improvement in business conditions of the countries within the reporting unit. As of August 31, 2021, the carrying values of goodwill were $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n0.4\nbillion for Boots reporting unit and Other international reporting unit, respectively.\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 the Company recorded an impairment of $\n49\nmillion on certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets. The fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit exceeded their carrying value amounts ranging from approximately\n5\n% to approximately\n27\n%, except for certain Boots indefinite lived Boots tradename assets which were impaired during the year. As of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangibles within the Boots reporting unit was $\n7.3\nbillion and $\n7.2\nbillion, respectively.\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, the Company completed a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets related to its\ntwo\nreporting units within the International segment, Boots and Other international, as a result of the significant impact of COVID-19 on their financial performance. Based on this analysis, the Company recorded impairment charges of $\n1.7\nbillion on Boots goodwill and $\n0.3\nbillion on certain indefinite-lived Boots tradename assets.\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31 2019, the Company recorded an impairment of $\n73\nmillion on its pharmacy licenses in the Boots reporting unit.\nAs part of the Company’s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including the projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates considering the impact of COVID-19, among other potential impacts. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Company’s reporting units, as well as how such performance may be impacted by COVID-19. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures, including considering the impact of COVID-19.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nare reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, including the impact of COVID-19, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. The Company will continue to monitor these potential impacts, including the impact of economic, industry and market trends and the impact these may have on Boots and Other international reporting units.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset or asset group may be impaired. During the year ended August 31, 2020, the Company evaluated certain definite-lived intangibles for impairment resulting in an impairment charge of $\n47\nmillion.\nNo\nimpairment was recorded for definite-lived intangibles in the year ended August 31, 2021.\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment consist of the following activity (in millions):\n1\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, the Company acquired the remaining two of three Rite Aid distribution centers including related inventory for cash consideration of $\n91\nmillion resulting in an increase to goodwill of $\n62\nmillion.\n2\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company acquired a controlling equity interest in Innovation Associates, Inc. and a joint venture with McKesson which resulted in an increase to goodwill of $\n394\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion, respectively.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

On December 18, 2019, the Company entered into an Extension Agreement (the “Extension Agreement”) relating to the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Mizuho, as administrative agent. The Extension Agreement extended the Maturity Date (as defined in the January 2019 364-Day Revolving Credit Agreement) for an additional period of 364 days to January 28, 2021. Such extension became effective on January 30, 2020. The January 2019 364 Day Revolving Credit Agreement was partially terminated on December 23, 2020, reducing the amount available to $0.5 billion. The outstanding facility amount was terminated on January 28, 2021.\nA&R December 2018 Credit Agreement\nOn December 5, 2018, the Company entered into a $\n1.0\nbillion term loan credit agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto and, on August 9, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to such credit agreement (such credit agreement as so amended, the “December 2018 Credit Agreement”) to permit the Company to borrow, repay and reborrow amounts borrowed thereunder prior to the maturity date. On April 2, 2020, the Company amended and restated the December 2018 Credit Agreement (such credit agreement as so amended and restated, the “A&R December 2018 Credit Agreement”).\nThe A\n&R December 2018 Credit Agreement\ngoverns a $\n2.0\nbillion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, consisting of the initial $\n1.0\nbillion senior unsecured revolving facility previously governed by the December 2018 Credit Agreement and a new $\n1.0\nbillion senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

The August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment in the amount of $\n3.5\nbillion, with a letter of credit sub-facility commitment amount of $\n500\nmillion. The facility termination date is the earlier of (a) August 29, 2023, subject to extension thereof pursuant to the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate amount of the revolving commitments pursuant to the August 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement.

The credit facilities contain various other customary covenants.\nCommercial paper\nThe Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. The Company had average daily commercial paper outstanding of $\n1.9\nbillion at a weighted average interest rate of\n0.45\n% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021. The Company had average daily commercial paper outstanding of $\n2.5\nbillion at a weighted average interest rate of\n2.15\n% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020.

Interest paid in the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 of $\n916\nmillion includes charges on early extinguishment of debt of $\n387\nmillion.\nNote 9.\nFinancial instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to market risks, including interest rate and currency risks, arising from operating and financing risks.\nThe Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk.\nThe notional amounts and fair value of derivative instruments outstanding were as follows (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNet investment hedges\nThe Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps as hedges and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge net investments in subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in the currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nCash flow hedges\nFrom time to time the Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows of certain floating-rate debt. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and released to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges\nThe Company enters into derivative transactions that are not designated as accounting hedges.\nThese derivative instruments are economic hedges of foreign currency risks. The Company also utilizes total return swaps to economically hedge variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The income and (expense) due to changes in fair value of these derivative instruments were recognized in earnings as follows (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDerivatives credit risk\nCounterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the Company to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance, and the Company regularly monitors the credit worthiness of each counterparty.\nDerivatives offsetting\nThe Company does not offset the fair value amounts of derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 10.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad Levels:\nLevel 1 -\nQuoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel 2 -\nObservable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.\nLevel 3 -\nUnobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1\nMoney market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor.\n2\nFair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices as of August 31, 2021 and 2020.\n3\nLevel 3 debt securities include investments in convertible debt securities of VillageMD which are valued on a quarterly basis using the Probability Weighted Expect Return Method with gains or losses recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. Inputs include the enterprise value, expected holding term of the investment, volatility and risk-free interest rates.\n4\nThe fair value of forward currency contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates. See Note 9 Financial instruments, for additional information.\n5\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on the applicable observable yield curves. See Note 9 Financial instruments, for additional information.\nThere were no transfers between Levels in fiscal 2021 or 2020.\nThe carrying value of the Company's commercial paper and credit facilities approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.\nThe Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Company’s debt in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of August 31, 2021, the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of long term notes outstanding including the current portion were $\n8.9\nbillion and $\n9.8\nbillion, respectively. The fair values of the notes outstanding are Level 1 fair value measures and determined based on quoted market price and translated at the August 31, 2021 rate, as applicable. The fair values and carrying values of these issuances do not include notes that have been redeemed or repaid as of August 31, 2021. See Note 8 Debt, for further information.\nThe carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.\nNote 11.\nCommitments and contingencies\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, subpoenas, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, healthcare, tax and other governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Company’s business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized.\nLike other companies in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. There continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities of, and increased litigation regarding, the Company’s and the rest of the health care and related industry’s business, compliance and reporting practices. As a result, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. In such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. After a private party has filed a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government.\nThe results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a material loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification,\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nwill have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs.\nOn December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co. and Walgreen Co., as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. (\nCutler v. Wasson et al.\n, No. 1:14-cv-10408 (N.D. Ill.)) The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of a securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015, described below. On November 3, 2016, the Court entered a stipulation and order extending the stay until the resolution of the securities class action.\nOn April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. (\nWashtenaw County Employees’ Retirement System v. Walgreen Co. et al.\n, No. 1:15-cv-3187 (N.D. Ill.)) The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. A motion to dismiss a consolidated class action complaint filed on August 17, 2015 was granted in part and denied in part on September 30, 2016. The court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification on March 29, 2018 and plaintiff filed a first amended complaint on December 19, 2018. A motion to dismiss the first amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part on September 23, 2019. Fact discovery and expert discovery have concluded. Motions for summary judgment have been fully briefed.\nOn December 11, 2017, purported Rite Aid shareholders filed an amended complaint in a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the “M.D. Pa. action”) arising out of transactions contemplated by the merger agreement between the Company and Rite Aid. The amended complaint alleged that the Company and certain of its officers made false or misleading statements regarding the transactions. The Court denied the Company’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint on April 15, 2019. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses, and the Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Fact discovery is ongoing. In October and December 2020, two separate purported Rite Aid Shareholders filed lawsuits in the same court as the M.D. Pa. action opting out of the class in the M.D. Pa. action making nearly identical allegations as those in the M.D. Pa. action (the “Direct Actions”). On December 24, 2020, the parties to the Direct Actions filed a joint stipulation to stay the Direct Actions until the earlier of (a) 30 days after the entry of an order resolving any pre-trial dispositive motions in the M.D. Pa. action, or (b) 30 days after the entry of an order of final approval of any settlement of the M.D. Pa. action. The court so ordered the joint stipulation on December 28, 2020.\nIn June 2019, a Fred’s, Inc. shareholder filed a nearly identical lawsuit to the M.D. Pa. action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, except naming Fred’s, Inc. and one of its former officers along with the Company and certain of its officers. Lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 4, 2019, which is substantially the same as the original complaint. The court granted the Company's motion to dismiss to the amended complaint on March 31, 2021.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against an array of defendants by various plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes, and others, alleging claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation, captioned\nIn re National Prescription Opiate Litigation\n(MDL No. 2804, Case No. 17-md-2804), is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (\"N.D. Ohio\"). The Company is involved in the following multidistrict litigation (MDL) bellwether cases: (1) two consolidated cases in N.D. Ohio (\nCnty. of Summit, Ohio, et al v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Case No. 18-op-45090;\nCnty. of Cuyahoga, Ohio, et al. v. Purdue Pharma L.P.\n, Case No. 18-op-45004), previously scheduled for trial in November 2020 but postponed indefinitely; (2) one remanded to the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma (\nThe Cherokee Nation v. McKesson Corp., et al.\n, Case No. 18-CV-00056-RAW-SPS), scheduled for trial in September 2022; (3) one remanded to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (\nCity and Cnty. of San Francisco, et al. v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Case No. 3:18-cv-07591-CRB), originally scheduled for trial in October 2021, but rescheduled for April 2022; and (4) two additional consolidated cases in N.D. Ohio (\nCnty. of Lake, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Case No. 18-op-45032;\nCnty. of Trumbull, Ohio v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Case No. 18-op-45079), initially scheduled for trial in May 2021 but continued until October 2021. In April 2021, the MDL court selected five additional bellwether cases involving the Company, all currently pending in N.D. Ohio: (1)\nCobb Cnty. v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Case No. 18-op-45817; (2)\nDurham Cnty. v. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp., et al.\n, Case No. 19-op-45346; (3)\nMontgomery Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Commrs., et al. v.

Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Case No. 18-op-45274.\nThe Company also has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in state courts relating to opioid matters. Trial dates have been set in cases pending in state courts in New Mexico (\nState of New Mexico, ex rel. Hector Balderas, Attorney General v. Purdue Ph\narma L.P., et al., Case No. D-101-cv-2017-02541, First Judicial District Court, Santa Fe County, New Mexico - September 2022); West Virginia\n(State of West Virginia, ex rel. Patrick Morrisey, Attorney General v. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., et al.,\nCivil Action No.20-C-82 PNM, Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, - September 2022; Missouri (\nJefferson County, Missouri v. Dannie E. Williams, M.D., et al.\n, Cause No. 20JE-CC00029, Twenty-Third Judicial Circuit, Jefferson County, Missouri - April 2023); Florida (\nState of Florida, Office of the Attorney General, Department of Legal Affairs v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Case No. 2018-CA-001438, Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pasco County, Florida - April 2022); Nevada (\nState of Nevada v. McKesson Corporation, et al.\n, Case No. A-19-796755-B, Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada - January 2023); Michigan (\nState of Michigan, ex rel. Dana Nessel, Attorney General v. Cardinal Health, Inc.\n,\net al.,\nCase No. 19-016896-NZ, Circuit Court for Wayne County, Michigan - October 2022); and Alabama (\nThe DCH Health Care Authority, et al. v. Purdue Pharma LP, et al.\n, Cause No. CV-2019-000007.00, Circuit Court of Conecuh County, Alabama - July 2022). Two consolidated cases in New York state court (\nCounty of Suffolk v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.\n, Index No. 400001/2017;\nCounty of Nassau v. Purdue Pharma L.P., et al.,\nIndex No. 400008/2017, Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County, New York) were resolved as to the Company after jury selection began in June 2021.\nThe relief sought by various plaintiffs in these matters includes compensatory, abatement and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief. Additionally, the Company has received from the Department of Justice and the Attorney Generals of numerous states subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and/or other requests concerning opioid matters. The Company has also had communications with the Department of Justice with respect to purported violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the federal False Claims Act in dispensing prescriptions at certain Walgreens locations. As discussed above, legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs and penalties incurred in these matters can be substantial.\nNote 12.\nIncome taxes\nU.S. tax law changes\nDuring 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department issued regulations to apply retroactively covering certain components of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Certain guidance included in these regulations is inconsistent with the Company’s interpretation that led to the recognition of $\n247\nmillion of tax benefits in prior periods. The tax benefits relate to the Company’s one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which was enacted as part of the 2017 U.S. tax law changes. Despite this guidance, the Company remains confident in its interpretation of the U.S. tax law changes and intends to defend this position through litigation, if necessary. However, if the Company is ultimately unsuccessful in defending its position, it may be required to reverse all or a portion of the benefits previously recorded.\nUK tax law changes\nOn June 10, 2021 the UK Finance Act 2021 was enacted increasing the UK tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. The Company recorded tax expense of $\n344\nmillion from re-measuring the net UK deferred tax liability in fiscal 2021. On July 22, 2020 the UK Finance Bill 2020 was enacted increasing the UK tax rate from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020. The Company recorded tax expense of $\n139\nmillion from re-measuring the net UK deferred tax liability in fiscal 2020.\nThe components of earnings from continuing operations before income tax provision were (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe provision for income taxes from continuing operations consists of the following (in millions):\nThe difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate from continuing operations is as follows:\n1\nNet of changes in related tax attributes and tax benefits from capital losses generated and utilized in FY21.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of the following (in millions):\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets for tax attributes of $\n7.5\nbillion, primarily reflecting the benefit of $\n670\nmillion in U.S. federal, $\n75\nmillion in state and $\n6.6\nbillion in non-U.S. ordinary and capital losses. In addition, these deferred tax assets include $\n97\nmillion of income tax credits. Of these deferred tax assets, $\n7.1\nbillion will expire at various dates from 2022 through 2038. The residual deferred tax assets of $\n398\nmillion have no expiration date.\nThe Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. The assessment of realization of deferred tax assets is performed based on the weight of the positive and negative evidence available to indicate whether the asset is recoverable, including tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n7.2\nbillion against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2021.\nIncome taxes paid, net of refunds were $\n336\nmillion, $\n626\nmillion and $\n893\nmillion for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2021, unrecognized tax benefits of $\n594\nmillion were reported as long-term liabilities, $\n475\nmillion were reported against deferred taxes, and $\n114\nmillion were reported against related tax receivables in other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nAt August 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $\n524\nmillion, $\n353\nmillion and $\n311\nmillion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $\n132\nmillion due to anticipated federal tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple state tax jurisdictions.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $\n84\nmillion and $\n58\nmillion, respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2021, and August 31, 2020, the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was $\n26\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion income tax expense, respectively.\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examinations for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2014. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2008. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in the UK prior to 2015, Luxembourg prior to 2016 and in Germany prior to 2014.\nThe Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are set to expire in September 2022. Upon expiration, a reduced tax rate will extend through December 2029. The holidays had a beneficial impact of $\n118\nmillion and $\n124\nmillion (inclusive of capital GILTI tax cost) during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above.\nAt August 31, 2021, it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration.\nNote 13.\nStock compensation plans\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2021 Omnibus Plan”). The 2021 Omnibus Plan replicates the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan and provides incentive compensation to the Company’s non-employee directors, officers and other eligible employees.\nThe Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the 2021 Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the 2021 Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards to certain employees. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with vesting requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n155\nmillion, $\n137\nmillion and $\n119\nmillion, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at August 31, 2021 was $\n151\nmillion, which will be fully recognized over the next\nthree years\n.\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 14.\nRetirement benefits\nThe Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan.\nDefined benefit pension plans (non-U.S. plans)\nThe Company has various defined benefit pension plans outside the U.S. The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan (the “Boots Plan”), which covers certain employees in the UK. The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010, with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis. The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold the majority of its assets in a diverse portfolio (\"Matching Portfolio\") which aims to broadly match the characteristics of the plan’s liabilities by investing in bonds, derivatives and other fixed income assets, with the remainder invested in predominantly return-seeking assets. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management.\nThe following tables present classes of defined benefit pension plan assets by fair value hierarchy (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1\nEquity securities, which mainly comprise of investments in commingled funds, are valued based on quoted prices and are primarily exchange-traded. Securities for which official close or last trade pricing on an active exchange is available are classified as Level 1 investments. If closing prices are not available, or the investments are in a commingled fund, securities are valued at the last quoted bid price and typically are categorized as Level 2 investments.\n2\nDebt securities: government bonds comprise of fixed interest and index linked bonds issued by central governments and are valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize pricing which considers readily available inputs such as the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type, as well as dealer-supplied prices.\n3\nDebt securities: corporate bonds comprise bonds issued by corporations in both segregated and commingled funds\nand are valued using recently executed transactions, or quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices.\n4\nReal estate comprise of investments in certain property funds which are valued based on the underlying properties. These properties are valued using a number of standard industry techniques such as cost, discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. Real estate investments are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal 2021 were driven by actual return on plan assets still held at August 31, 2021 and purchases during the year.\n5\nOther investments mainly comprise of net receivable (payable) amounts for unsettled transactions, cash and cash equivalents, derivatives, insurance linked securities and direct private placements. Cash is categorized as a Level 1 investment and cash in commingled funds is categorized as Level 2 investments. Amounts receivable (payable) are categorized as level 2 investments. Cash equivalents are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Derivatives which are exchange-traded and for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market, or exchange on which they are traded, and are categorized as Level 1 investments. Over-the-counter derivatives typically are valued by independent pricing services and are categorized as Level 2 investments. Insurance lined securities are categorized as Level 2. Direct private placements are typically bonds valued by reference to comparable bonds and are categorized as Level 3 investments. Changes in Level 3 investments during fiscal 2021 were primarily driven by purchases during the year.\nComponents of net periodic pension costs for the defined benefit pension plans and cumulative pre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss are as follows (in millions):\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit pension plans were as follows:\nBased on current actuarial estimates, the Company plans to make contributions of $\n41\nmillion to its defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2022 and expects to make contributions beyond 2022, which will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of the defined benefit pension plan assets.\nDefined contribution plans\nThe principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Company’s contribution is in the form of a guaranteed match which is made pursuant to the applicable plan document approved by the Walgreen Co. Board of Directors. Plan activity is reviewed periodically by certain Committees of the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of $\n221\nmillion, $\n227\nmillion and $\n239\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s contributions were $\n222\nmillion, $\n226\nmillion and $\n234\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the UK based to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings was $\n101\nmillion, $\n91\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.\nPostretirement healthcare plan\nThe Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. The Company’s postretirement health benefit plan obligation was $\n154\nmillion and $\n182\nmillion in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid net of the estimated federal subsidy during fiscal 2022 is $\n9.5\nmillion.\nNote 15.\nCapital stock\nIn June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the “June 2018 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $\n10.0\nbillion of the Company's common stock, which program has no specified expiration date. The Company purchased\n30\nmillion shares under the June 2018 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2020 at a cost of $\n1.5\nbillion. In July 2020, the Company announced that it had suspended activities under this program and no shares were repurchased in fiscal 2021. As of August 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $\n2.0\nbillion remaining under the June 2018 stock repurchase program.\nThe Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.\nIn addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $\n110\nmillion were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2021 as compared to $\n103\nmillion and $\n339\nmillion in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. As of August 31, 2021,\n71\nmillion shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Company’s various employee benefit plans.\nNote 16.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nWALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC.

Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Share Purchase Agreement, AmerisourceBergen agreed to purchase the majority of the Company's Alliance Healthcare business as well as a portion of the Company’s retail pharmacy international businesses in Europe. The majority of the Disposal Group was previously included in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Effective as of the second quarter of fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, the Company eliminated the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment and is aligned into\ntwo\nreportable segments: United States and International. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company’s operating segments. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources; therefore, the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included.\nUnited States\nThe Company's United States segment includes the Company's Walgreens business which includes the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, and mail and central specialty pharmacy services, and the Company's equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen. Sales for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of retail products, including health and wellness, beauty, personal care and consumables and general merchandise.\nInternational\nThe Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.\nThe results of operations for reportable segments include procurement benefits.

(“CareCentrix”), a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors, for consideration of approximately $\n330\nmillion, subject to a net debt adjustment. The investment will result in the Company owning approximately\n55\n% controlling equity interest in CareCentrix. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company has an option to acquire the remaining equity interests of CareCentrix in the future. CareCentrix’ other equity holders will also have an option to require the Company to purchase the remaining equity interests. The transaction is subject to the receipt of required regulatory clearances and approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, the Company will account for this acquisition as a business combination and consolidate CareCentrix in its financial statements.\nOn September 17, 2021 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a majority equity interest in Shields Health Solutions (“Shields”), an industry leader in integrated, health system-owned specialty pharmacy care, for a cash consideration of approximately $\n970\nmillion. The additional equity interest, combined with the Company's current minority equity investment, will result in the Company owning approximately\n71\n% controlling equity interest in Shields. Under the terms of the transaction agreements, the Company has an option to acquire the remaining equity interests of Shields in the future. Shields’ other equity holders will also have an option to require the Company to purchase the remaining equity interests. The transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of calendar 2021. At close of the transaction, the Company will account for this acquisition of the majority equity interest as a business combination and consolidate Shields in its financial statements, remeasuring its current minority equity interest at fair value with resulting gain to be recognized in Other income in the Statement of Earnings.\nOn October 14, 2021 the Company announced that it has agreed to make an additional $\n5.2\nbillion investment in VillageMD to advance its strategic position in the delivery of value-based primary care. The incremental investment increases the Company’s ownership stake in VillageMD to approximately\n63\n% from approximately\n30\n% on a fully diluted basis, and increases the number of co-located clinics from\n600\nprimary care clinics to\n1,000\nby the year 2027. The investment will be comprised of $\n4.0\nbillion in cash, to be paid by the Company to VillageMD at the closing of the transaction, and a promissory note in the principal amount of $\n1.2\nbillion to VillageMD at the closing of the transaction. The Company expects to fund the cash portion of the investment through a combination of cash on hand and available credit facilities. The transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by the end of calendar 2021. Upon closing, the Company will account for this transaction as a business combination and consolidate VillageMD in its financial statements. The Company will remeasure its current minority equity interest and debt security at fair value with resulting gain recognized in Other income in the Statement of Earnings.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As permitted by the SEC, our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting excludes internal control over financial reporting of equity method investees. However, our assessment of internal control over financial reporting with respect to equity method investees did include controls over the recording of amounts related to our investment that are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including controls over the selection of accounting methods for our investments, the recognition of equity method earnings and losses and the determination, valuation and recording of our investment account balances.\nAdditionally, the scope of management’s evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the acquisition of the pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany as described in Note 3 Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staff’s general guidance that an assessment of a business may be omitted from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2021. The acquisition of the pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany represented approximately 0.4% of the Company’s total assets as of August 31, 2021 after excluding goodwill recorded and 3.8% of the Company’s sales for the year ended August 31, 2021.\nBased on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2021. Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in its report which is included herein.\nOctober 14, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of August 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2021 and 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 14, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nThe Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) effective September 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach which does not require prior periods to be restated.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment –Boots Reporting Unit and Boots Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company uses the income and the market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units in its goodwill impairment analysis. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach requires management to estimate fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The Company primarily uses the multi-period excess earnings\nmodel and the relief from royalty model to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Changes in assumptions or the selection of companies in the comparable industry group could have a significant impact on the valuation of the reporting units and the amount of a goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge, if any.\nWe identified the valuation of the Boots Reporting Unit and Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical audit matter due to the materiality of the assets’ carrying values, the difference between the fair values and the carrying values, and because the current economic environment, including the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic, has affected the business. Auditing management’s judgments used in the quantitative assessment regarding significant assumptions related to future revenue growth, EBITDA margins, the selection of the discount rate, the selection of the royalty rates for the Boots trade name indefinite-lived intangible assets, and the market multiples selected for the Boots Reporting Unit requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the fair value of goodwill for the Boots Reporting Unit and the Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the goodwill and intangible asset impairment analyses, including those over the development of forecasts of future revenues, EBITDA margins, and the selection of royalty rates, market multiples, and discount rates.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and EBITDA margins by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA margins by performing certain procedures, including:\n◦\nComparing the forecasts to internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\n◦\nComparing the business forecasts and planned initiatives to third-party economic and industry data.\n•\nWe performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the risk of impairment if key assumptions are changed.\n•\nWe evaluated, with the assistance of our fair value specialists, the (1) valuation methodology used for the Boots Reporting Unit’s goodwill and the Boots indefinite-lived intangible assets, and (2) the reasonableness of the related discount rates, by performing certain procedures, including:\n◦\nComparing the valuation methodologies used to generally accepted valuation practices for each asset type.\n◦\nEvaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s selection of companies in its industry comparable group for comparability to the Reporting Unit.\n◦\nTesting the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n◦\nDeveloping an independent discount rate and comparing it to the discount rate selected by management.\nIncome Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has a complex legal structure involving numerous domestic and foreign locations with constantly changing tax laws and regulations. The Company’s management is required to interpret and apply these tax laws and regulations in determining the amount of its income tax liability and provision. When an uncertain tax position is identified by management, the Company must evaluate whether it is more likely to be sustained than not on the basis of its technical merits. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The evaluation of each uncertain tax position requires management to apply specialized skill, knowledge, and significant judgment related to the identified position. This significant judgment includes determining the correct value of the liability based on the selected method of measurement, data, and assumptions determined by management.\nBecause of the numerous taxing jurisdictions in which the Company files its tax returns and the complexity of tax laws and regulations, auditing uncertain tax positions and the determination of whether the more likely than not threshold was met requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our income tax specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to unrecognized tax benefits included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over income taxes, including those over identifying uncertain tax positions and measuring liabilities.\n•\nWe evaluated, with the assistance of our tax specialists, a selection of underlying tax positions to evaluate the more likely than not principle as it applied to the specific underlying tax position.\n•\nWe evaluated, with the assistance of our tax specialists, the Company’s unrecognized tax positions by performing the following:\n◦\nObtaining management and third-party opinions or memoranda regarding the analysis of uncertain tax positions and identifying the key judgments and evaluating whether the analysis was consistent with our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations.\n◦\nEvaluating management’s method of measuring its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including underlying data and assumptions.\n◦\nEvaluating the basis for certain intercompany transactions, such as transfer pricing, as well as internal restructuring, by comparison to economic studies performed by management and third-party data.\n◦\nEvaluating the matters raised by tax authorities in former and ongoing tax audits and considering the implications of these matters on open tax years.\n◦\nAssessing changes and interpretation of applicable tax law.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 14, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of August 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated October 14, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of certain assets acquired from GEHE Pharma Handel GmbH, which were acquired during the year ended August 31, 2021. The certain assets acquired from GEHE represented approximately 0.4% of the Company’s total assets as of August 31, 2021 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded and 3.8% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended August 31, 2021. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting for the certain assets acquired from GEHE.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion\n.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 14, 2021"

    "text": "Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). In fiscal 2021, the Company and McKesson Corporation closed a transaction to form a combined pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany. The Company owns a controlling equity interest in the combined business which is consolidated by the Company. The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination. The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment for one year following the acquisition. The recognition of goodwill and intangible assets, however, is covered by our internal controls over mergers and acquisitions, which were included in management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2021. Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nReport on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company reviews its internal control over financial reporting and makes changes to its systems and processes that are intended to enhance such controls and increase efficiency while maintaining an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls and modifying monitoring controls.\nAs we transform our business processes, we continue to make strategic changes in how we perform certain key business functions. These changes include the continued leveraging of extended workforces via third-party outsource arrangements as well as our continued implementation of new information systems. These initiatives are not being implemented in response to any identified internal control deficiency or weakness. As these changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the Company’s management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2021 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent limitations on effectiveness of controls\nOur management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures."

The expanded Transformational Cost Management Program will deliver incremental savings from existing programs and a comprehensive funnel of new initiatives which will improve operating effectiveness and better position the core business for the future.
