    "text": "Business Overview\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we are one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the U.S. We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located primarily in markets across the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S. At December 31, 2020, our consolidated total assets, total deposits and total shareholders’ equity were $466.7 billion, $365.3 billion and $54.0 billion, respectively.\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 with the consolidation of Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation. Since 1983, we have diversified our geographical presence, business mix and product capabilities through organic growth, strategic bank and non-bank acquisitions and equity investments, and the formation of various non-banking subsidiaries.\nPending Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc.\nOn November 16, 2020, PNC announced a definitive agreement with BBVA, S.A. to acquire BBVA, a U.S. financial holding company conducting its business operations primarily through its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, for a fixed purchase price of $11.6 billion in cash. BBVA USA has over 600 branches in Texas, Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico. The transaction is expected to add approximately $102 billion in total assets, $86 billion of deposits and $66 billion of loans to PNC’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and to close in mid-2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and our Current Reports on Form 8-K dated November 16, 2020 and November 19, 2020 contain additional information regarding this pending acquisition.\nSecond Quarter Sale of Equity Investment in BlackRock, Inc.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, PNC divested its entire 22.4% equity investment in BlackRock. Net proceeds from the sale were $14.2 billion. The after-tax gain on the sale of $4.3 billion, and donation expense and BlackRock’s historical results for all periods presented, are reported as discontinued operations. For additional details on the divestiture of our equity investment in BlackRock, see Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and public health response to contain it led to a severe recession in the first half of 2020, after the U.S. economy reached a peak in economic activity in February 2020. There is still a great deal of uncertainty about the length and severity of the pandemic and the strength or reversal of the economic rebound, including whether there will be additional fiscal stimulus from the federal government and, if so, its size, scope and effectiveness.\nPNC is committed to putting our resources to work to support our customers, communities and the broader financial system. PNC participated in funding PPP loans under the CARES Act and, at December 31, 2020, had $12.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding, down from the $13.7 billion funded during the second quarter of 2020 as a result of loan forgiveness and repayments. PNC also is participating in funding new and second draw PPP loans in 2021 under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. PNC continues to grant\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n1\nloan modifications for customers in need through various hardship relief programs. We analyze and make decisions on these modifications based on each individual borrower’s situation. PNC is also assisting customers with the PPP loan forgiveness process. See the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 for details on our commercial and consumer loan modifications.\nOur retail branches have largely reopened as we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our customers and employees, while complying with all state and local health mandates and managing in accordance with Center for Disease Control guidelines. As of February 16, 2021, approximately 98% of PNC branch lobbies were fully opened.\nOur technology infrastructure and systems are designed for business resiliency and security. We have leveraged these capabilities and our business continuity plans to execute a work-from-home strategy, which has resulted in many of our employees working from home during 2020 and into 2021. PNC has also implemented various strategies that are designed to promote the health and safety of our employees who need to be on-site to execute their job responsibilities.\nSee the Supervision and Regulation section of this Item 1 for additional detail on the CARES Act and other governmental responses to the pandemic and its economic and financial impacts. Also see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report for a description of the associated risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSubsidiaries\nOur corporate legal structure at December 31, 2020 consisted of one domestic subsidiary bank, including its subsidiaries, and 51 active non-bank subsidiaries, in addition to various affordable housing investments and historic rehabilitation investments. Our bank subsidiary is PNC Bank, a national bank headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. For additional information on certain of our subsidiaries, see Exhibit 21 to this Report.\nStatistical Disclosure By Bank Holding Companies\nThe following statistical information is included on the indicated pages of this Report and is incorporated herein by reference:\nSupervision and Regulation\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a BHC registered under the BHC Act and a financial holding company under the GLB Act.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations, some of which are highlighted below. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our regulatory matters. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments, impose conditions and requirements on the products and services we offer and the manner in which they are offered and sold, and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, investment management and other customers, among other things. They also restrict our ability to repurchase stock or pay dividends, or to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary, and impose capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. The consequences of noncompliance with these, or other applicable laws or regulations, can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions.\nIn addition, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and periodic examination by, among other regulatory bodies, the Federal Reserve and the OCC. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory policies of\n2\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nthe agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, the ability and performance of management and the board of directors, the effectiveness of internal controls and internal audit function, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.\nThe results of examination activity by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity and take enforcement action, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements, against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines, among other things, that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable law or regulations, are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner, or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice. This supervisory framework, including the examination reports and supervisory ratings (which are not publicly available) of the agencies, could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations.\nThe CFPB is responsible for examining us for compliance with most federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws relating to fair lending and prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products or services, and for enforcing such laws with respect to PNC Bank and its affiliates. The results of the CFPB’s examinations (which are not publicly available) also can result in restrictions or limitations on the operations of a regulated entity as well as enforcement actions against a regulated entity, including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements.\nWe also are subject to regulation by the SEC by virtue of our status as a public company and by the SEC and the CFTC due to the nature of some of our businesses. Our businesses with operations outside the U.S. also are subject to regulation by appropriate authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which they do business.\nAs a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the operation and growth of our businesses. The Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, SEC, CFTC and other domestic and foreign regulators have broad enforcement powers, and certain of the regulators have the power to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our applications or notices to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses, assets or deposits, expand our operations geographically, or reconfigure existing operations.\nAmong the areas that have been receiving a high level of regulatory focus are compliance with the BSA and anti-money laundering laws, capital and liquidity management (including stress testing), the structure and effectiveness of enterprise risk management frameworks, the management of risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the protection of confidential customer information, cyber security, the oversight of arrangements with third-party vendors and suppliers, and compliance with fair lending and other consumer protection laws and regulations, including those governing retail sales practices, fee disclosures, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, collection practices, and protections for military service members and individuals in bankruptcy.\nNew legislation, changes in rules promulgated by federal financial regulators, other federal and state regulatory authorities and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, may directly affect the operations and profitability of our businesses. We anticipate new legislative and regulatory initiatives over the next several years, focused specifically on banking and other financial services in which we are engaged. Legislative and regulatory developments to date, as well as those that come in the future, have had and are likely to continue to have an impact on the conduct of our business. The more detailed description of the significant regulations to which we are subject included in this Report is based on current laws and regulations and is subject to potentially material change. See also the additional information included as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report discussing the impact of financial regulatory initiatives on the regulatory environment for us and the financial services industry.\nThe profitability of our businesses could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial sectors in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation, electronic commerce, data security and privacy.\nThere are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies. Accordingly, the following discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws, regulations and policies that apply to us. To a substantial extent, the purpose of the regulation and supervision of financial services institutions and their holding companies is not to protect our shareholders and our non-customer creditors, but rather to protect our customers (including depositors) and the financial markets and financial system in general.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n3\nCOVID-19 Relief\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. Government has taken a wide variety of actions in order to aid businesses and consumers financially impacted by COVID-19, facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets, and assist banking organizations in being able to meet the credit and other banking needs of their customers and communities.\nThe CARES Act, as subsequently amended by the PPP and Health Care Enhancement Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, authorizes the SBA and the Treasury Department to expend up to $943 billion to support the issuance by SBA-approved lenders of first-draw loans of up to $10 million and second-draw loans of up to $2 million to small and medium-sized businesses that meet certain size and other eligibility requirements under the PPP. Borrowers may use the proceeds of a PPP loan only for specified purposes (such as meeting payroll) and borrowers can have the loan partially or fully forgiven (and repaid by the SBA) to the extent the borrower expends funds during a limited period following receipt of the loan proceeds for payroll costs or other specified expenses. Eligible businesses may apply for a first-or second-draw PPP loan until March 31, 2021. Borrowers and lenders are required to provide certain certifications and documentation, and conduct certain reviews, in connection with PPP loan applications as specified in the PPP rules and associated guidance, which are subject to change and further clarification by the SBA and Treasury. PNC Bank is participating in the PPP.\nThe CARES Act also permits residential and multifamily mortgage borrowers with federally backed mortgages to request payment forbearance for up to six months or 30 days, respectively, under a streamlined process if the borrower is experiencing a financial hardship due to the COVID-19 national emergency. The borrower may request an extension of these forbearance periods, for up to an additional six months for residential borrowers and 60 days for multifamily borrowers. Residential mortgage borrowers with federally backed mortgages, and tenants of multifamily borrowers that receive forbearance under these provisions, also benefit from certain foreclosure and eviction protections. For these purposes, federally backed mortgages include those guaranteed or insured by the FNMA, FHLMC, FHA or VA. Under revised Federal Housing Finance Agency policies, servicers of FNMA and FHLMC-guaranteed residential mortgages, such as PNC Bank, will no longer have an obligation to advance scheduled payments on a mortgage loan that is in a mortgage-backed security once the servicer has advanced four months of missed payments on the loan. Various states and municipalities also have imposed new foreclosure and eviction limitations of varying scope and degree in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act also provides consumers certain temporary protections up to 120 days after the termination of the COVID-19 national emergency against the reporting of negative credit information to a credit reporting agency as a result of loan accommodations provided.\nThe CARES Act, as modified by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, permits financial institutions to temporarily suspend the requirements under GAAP to categorize loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic as a TDR through the earlier of 60 days after the national emergency termination or January 2, 2022, and the determination of such a loan modification as being a TDR. The federal banking agencies, along with the CFPB and the National Credit Union Administration, and separately the FFIEC, released statements that, among other things, clarify the agencies’ and FFIEC’s views on TDRs, including the interaction between agency guidance on TDRs and the CARES Act, and prudent risk management and consumer protection principles. We are following the provisions within the CARES Act, as amended, and the agencies’ and FFIEC’s statements when evaluating our COVID-19 related loan modification requests.\nFederal Reserve Liquidity Facilities.\nTo help promote the flow of credit and the orderly functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve in 2020 established a number of new lending or liquidity facilities using its emergency lending authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Many of these facilities are or were supported by funding provided by the Treasury Department, either from the Emergency Stabilization Fund or under the CARES Act. Certain of these facilities (the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, Municipal Liquidity Facility, Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility and Main Street Lending Facility) have ceased making or purchasing new extensions of credit. The following emergency facilities continue to make or purchase new extensions of credit:\n•\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility, which purchases highly rated unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper issued by eligible U.S. issuers;\n•\nPaycheck Protection Program Lending Facility, which provides lenders funding secured by SBA-guaranteed loans made under the PPP described above;\n•\nPrimary Dealer Credit Facility, which provides secured funding to broker-dealers that are registered as primary dealers with the Federal Reserve in exchange for a broad range of collateral; and\n•\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, which provides liquidity to money market mutual funds by lending to U.S. banking entities in exchange for highly-rated collateral acquired from money market mutual funds.\nIn October 2020, the Federal banking agencies finalized rules to encourage banking organizations to use the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility. Under the rules, banking organizations may exclude from leverage and risk-based capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the Federal Reserve on a non-recourse basis as part of these programs, and they are required to neutralize the effect under the LCR of participating in these programs. The banking\n4\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nagencies also clarified that, consistent with the CARES Act, covered loans originated by a banking organization under the PPP will receive a zero percent risk weight for regulatory capital purposes, even if not pledged to the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition, in March 2020, the Federal Reserve announced changes to its discount window lending for insured depository institutions, such as PNC Bank. These changes permit insured depository institutions to borrow from the discount window, on a fully collateralized basis, for periods of up to 90 days, with such loans being prepayable and renewable by the borrowing institution on a daily basis. These changes, which will remain in effect until the Federal Reserve announces otherwise, provide insured depository institutions additional tools for managing their liquidity profile, including for purposes of the LCR. The Federal Reserve must publicly disclose the details (including the name of the borrower or counterparty) of discount window transactions and transactions conducted by facilities established by the Federal Reserve on a delayed basis.\nThe Federal banking agencies, CFPB, SEC, and CFTC have issued other rules, guidance, statements, orders or other actions to, among other things, facilitate the continued provision of financial services, encourage financial institutions to work with customers affected by the pandemic, and reduce operational or regulatory challenges resulting from the pandemic and the private-sector and governmental actions designed to mitigate its effects. These actions and statements, among others, clarified when appraisals or evaluations are required for real estate-secured transactions and allowed required appraisals and evaluations to be deferred in certain circumstances, encouraged banking organizations to use their capital and liquidity buffers to continue to provide credit to customers and support the smooth functioning of markets, and encouraged financial institutions to make available small-dollar loans to consumers and small businesses affected by COVID-19.\nBanking Regulation and Supervision\nRegulatory Capital Requirements, Stress Testing and Capital Planning\n. PNC and PNC Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. The foundation of the agencies’ regulatory capital rules is the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee, the international body responsible for developing global regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions. The regulatory capital rules establish minimum requirements for the ratio of a banking organization’s regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets, referred to as risk-based capital requirements, as well as for the ratio of its regulatory capital to measures of assets and other exposures, referred to as leverage capital requirements. The agencies’ regulatory capital rules have undergone significant change since 2013, when the agencies adopted final rules to implement the Basel Committee’s international regulatory capital framework, known as “Basel III”, as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nIn 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted rules to better tailor the application of their capital, liquidity and enhanced prudential requirements for banking organizations to the asset size and risk profile (as measured by certain regulatory metrics) of the banking organization (the “2019 Tailoring Rules”). Effective January 1, 2020, the agencies’ capital and liquidity rules classify all BHCs with $100 billion or more in total assets into one of four categories (Category I, Category II, Category III and Category IV), with the most stringent capital and liquidity requirements applying to Category I firms and the least restrictive requirements applying to Category IV firms. The classification of any bank subsidiary of a BHC generally follows that of its parent BHC. PNC and PNC Bank currently are Category III firms because PNC (i) has more than $250 billion, but less than $700 billion, in consolidated total assets, (ii) is not designated as a GSIB, and (iii) has less than $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity. PNC and PNC Bank would become a Category I or II institution, and subject to more stringent capital and liquidity standards, if PNC were at some point in the future to have $700 billion or more in total consolidated assets, be designated as a GSIB, or have $75 billion or more in cross-jurisdictional activity. As of December 31, 2020, PNC had cross-jurisdictional activities for these purposes of $13.3 billion. PNC does not expect the pending acquisition of BBVA, if consummated, would affect its classification as a Category III institution.\nThe regulatory capital rules generally divide regulatory capital into three components: CET1 capital, additional Tier 1 capital (which, together with CET1 capital, comprises Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital is generally common stock, retained earnings, and qualifying minority interest less required deductions. Prior to January 1, 2020, CET1 capital for PNC and PNC Bank also included AOCI related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans. Effective January 1, 2020, and as permitted by the 2019 Tailoring Rules, PNC and PNC Bank elected to exclude AOCI related to these items from CET1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and qualifying minority interests, less required deductions. Tier 2 capital generally comprises qualifying subordinated debt and, subject to certain quantitative limits, ACL, less any required deductions from Tier 2 capital. The regulatory capital rules limit the extent to which minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries may be included in regulatory capital. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, less the deductions required from Total capital.\nUnder the regulatory capital rules effective as of January 1, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank must deduct investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets (in each case, net of associated deferred tax liabilities) from CET1 capital to the extent such items individually exceed 25% of the institution’s adjusted CET1 capital. As of December 31, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank’s investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, MSRs and deferred tax assets did not exceed this threshold.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n5\nThe agencies’ capital rules also permit banking organizations to elect to phase-in, on a straight-line basis over a three-year period, the day-one regulatory capital effects of implementing the FASB’s ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), commonly referred to as the CECL standard. PNC implemented the CECL standard effective January 1, 2020, but elected not to implement the phase-in of the day-one regulatory capital effects of the standard. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for more detail on the CECL standard. Separately, the Federal banking agencies adopted a rule that permits banking organizations that are subject to CECL during 2020 to delay CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date compared to CECL ACL at transition. For institutions electing to utilize this CECL transition rule for regulatory capital, the estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 through December 31, 2021, then phased-out over the following three years. PNC and PNC Bank have elected this five-year transition period effective March 31, 2020, which impacts regulatory capital ratios disclosed in this Report.\nPNC and PNC Bank are required to use the standardized approach for determining a banking organization’s risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios. The standardized approach for risk-weighted assets takes into account credit and market risk. To calculate risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach for credit risk, the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are generally multiplied by risk weights set forth in the rules, with the risk weights increasing as the perceived credit risk of the relevant asset or exposure increases. For certain types of exposures, such as securitization exposures, the standardized approach establishes one or more methodologies that are to be used to calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for the exposure. High volatility commercial real estate, past due, securitization and equity exposures, as well as MSRs and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital, are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures. Under the market risk capital rule, risk-weighted asset amounts for covered trading positions are determined based on the calculation of VAR (including stressed value-at-risk), specific risk, incremental risk and comprehensive risk amounts, as specified in the capital rules.\nWe refer to the capital ratios calculated using the definition of capital under the agencies’ Basel III capital rules and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized risk-weighted assets, as our Basel III regulatory capital ratios.\nThe risk-based capital rules establish certain minimum standards for the capital ratios of banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank. Banking organizations must maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a Total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets, to be considered “adequately capitalized.” In 2020, the Federal Reserve introduced a CET1 SCB for BHCs subject to the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process, such as PNC. The SCB is calculated based on the difference between a firm’s starting and minimum CET1 ratio (as projected by the Federal Reserve) in the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario during the CCAR process, plus four quarters of the organization’s planned common stock dividends (expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets), subject to a floor of 2.5%. Based on PNC’s performance under the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests as part of CCAR 2020, PNC’s SCB for the period from the fourth quarter of 2020 through the third quarter of 2021 was set at 2.5%. While PNC Bank is not subject to a SCB, PNC Bank is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer in the form of CET1 equal to a fixed 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\nPNC and PNC Bank must maintain risk-based capital above the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements plus its SCB (in the case of PNC) or capital conservation buffer (in the case of PNC Bank) in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and repurchases of any Tier 1 capital instrument, such as common and qualifying preferred stock, and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. As a result, PNC and PNC Bank must maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 7.0%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.5%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 10.5% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. Because PNC’s SCB is established as part of the CCAR process, and is based on PNC’s projected performance (as determined by the Federal Reserve) under the relevant Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario (which can change, potentially materially, from stress test to stress test), PNC’s SCB may vary, potentially materially, over time and, thus, PNC may be required to maintain capital above these levels to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments.\nIn addition, while a firm’s SCB is typically determined as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR process, the Federal Reserve has reserved the right to conduct supervisory stress tests, require a firm to submit a revised capital plan, and calculate a firm’s SCB, more frequently. BHCs subject to a SCB, such as PNC, generally may increase their capital distributions without seeking prior Federal Reserve approval, provided the BHC otherwise complies with its SCB and any other applicable capital or capital distribution requirements. However, in light of ongoing economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve has imposed special limitations on dividends and share repurchases by CCAR-participating BHCs during the first quarter of 2021 and these restrictions may be continued in future quarters, potentially in modified form.\nFor Category III banking organizations (such as PNC and PNC Bank), these higher SCB or capital conservation buffer levels above the regulatory minimums could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. This buffer is currently set at zero in the U.S. A Federal Reserve policy statement establishes the framework and factors the Federal Reserve would use in setting and adjusting the amount of the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer. Covered banking\n6\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\norganizations would generally have 12 months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement, unless the Federal Reserve determines to establish an earlier effective date. If the full countercyclical buffer amount is implemented, PNC and PNC Bank would be required to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 11%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 13% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments.\nThe regulatory capital rules also require that banking organizations maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital as compared to average consolidated assets, referred to as the leverage ratio, and require Category III banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital as compared to total leverage exposure, referred to as the SLR. Total leverage exposure takes into account on-balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts. Banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0%, and Category III banking organizations must maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0%. As of December 31, 2020, the leverage and SLR ratios of PNC and PNC Bank were above the required minimum level.\nPNC and PNC Bank are not subject to the additional CET1 capital surcharge, minimum long-term debt requirement, minimum TLAC, or enhanced SLR requirements that apply to U.S. GSIBs.\nFailure to meet applicable capital requirements could subject a banking organization to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal banking agencies, including a limitation on the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital and, in severe cases, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. In some cases, the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The thresholds at which an insured depository institution is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” are based on (i) the institution’s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios; (ii) the institution’s leverage ratio; and (iii) for the definitions of “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized”, the institution’s SLR (if applicable). Generally, the smaller an institution’s capital base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers. Business activities may also be affected by an institution’s capital classification. For example, as a financial holding company, PNC and PNC Bank must remain “well capitalized.”\nAt December 31, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” For additional discussion of capital adequacy requirements, including the levels of capital required to be considered “well capitalized,” see the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nIn addition to regulatory capital requirements, we are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, capital stress testing requirements and CCAR process, as well as the DFAST requirements of the Federal Reserve and the OCC.\nAs part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital planning process of BHCs, including PNC, that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For us, this capital planning assessment is based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve that describes the company’s planned capital actions, such as plans to pay or increase common stock dividends, engage in common stock repurchase programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the Federal Reserve under different hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including a supervisory severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule provides that a BHC must resubmit a new capital plan prior to the next annual submission date if, among other things, there has been or will be a material change in the BHC’s risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. In light of the economic uncertainty presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve required large BHCs like PNC to resubmit their capital plans and additional stress test results in December 2020. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects to complete the review of these resubmitted capital plans in early 2021.\nIn evaluating PNC’s capital plan, the Federal Reserve also considers a number of qualitative factors. In assessing a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes, the Federal Reserve considers whether the BHC has sound and effective governance to oversee these processes. The Federal Reserve’s evaluation focuses on whether a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes are supported by a strong risk management framework to identify, measure and assess material risks and that provides a strong foundation to capital planning. The Federal Reserve also considers the comprehensiveness of a BHC’s control framework and evaluates a BHC’s policy guidelines for capital planning and assessing capital adequacy. A BHC’s stress testing scenario design processes and approaches for estimating the impact of stress on its capital position, including stress testing models and non-model qualitative approaches, are comprehensively reviewed to ensure that projections reflect the impact of appropriately stressful conditions, as well as risks idiosyncratic to the BHC, on its capital position. Significant deficiencies in a BHC’s capital planning and stress testing processes\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n7\nmay result in supervisory directives that require the firm to address the identified deficiencies and, potentially, a downgrade in the BHC’s supervisory capital positions and planning rating.\nIn connection with the 2021 CCAR exercise, we must file our capital plan and stress testing results using financial data as of December 31, 2020, with the Federal Reserve by April 6, 2021. We expect to receive the Federal Reserve’s response to the capital plan submitted as part of the 2021 CCAR, as well as PNC’s preliminary SCB for the period from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, in June 2021. The Federal Reserve must provide firms their final SCB for this period by August 31, 2021, which would reflect any changes made to the firm’s planned common stock dividends to remain in compliance with the firm’s SCB.\nAs part of the annual CCAR and DFAST processes, the Federal Reserve releases certain revenue, loss and capital results for each participating firm from its supervisory stress testing exercises. As a Category III institution, PNC must conduct a company-run DFAST stress test biennially in even numbered years and release PNC’s projections of certain revenue, loss and capital results from the exercise under the agencies’ hypothetical supervisory severely adverse macro-economic scenario and applying the agencies’ DFAST capital action assumptions.\nRegulatory Liquidity Standards and Liquidity Risk Management Requirements\n. The Basel Committee’s Basel III framework also includes short-term liquidity standards (LCR) and long-term funding standards (NSFR).\nThe U.S. banking agencies’ LCR rules are designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and HQLA to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions prescribed in the rules (net cash outflow). A company’s LCR is the amount of its HQLA, as calculated in accordance with the haircuts and limitations in the rule, divided by its net cash outflows, with the quotient expressed as a percentage. The regulatory minimum LCR that covered banking organizations are required to maintain is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis. If either institution’s LCR is below the minimum requirement for three consecutive business days, the institution must promptly provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum LCR requirement. At December 31, 2020, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required minimum levels.\nThe NSFR is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. In 2020, the federal banking agencies finalized rules that would implement the NSFR in the U.S., which become effective July 1, 2021. The rules require a covered BHC to calculate its NSFR as the ratio of its ASF to its RSF amount over a one-year horizon. The regulatory minimum ratio for all covered banking organizations (expressed as a percentage) is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank are required to calculate the NSFR on an ongoing basis. If either institution’s NSFR falls, or is likely to fall below, the minimum requirement, the institution must provide its regulator with a plan for achieving compliance with the minimum NSFR requirement.\nWe expect PNC and PNC Bank to be in compliance with the NSFR when it becomes effective.\nAs Category III institutions with less than $75 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to reduced LCR and NSFR requirements, with each company’s LCR net outflows and RSF (as calculated under the rules) reduced by 15%, thereby reducing the amount of HQLA or ASF each institution must hold to meet the LCR and NSFR minimum requirements, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, PNC had weighted short-term wholesale funding for these purposes of $31.4 billion.\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including PNC, to publicly disclose certain quantitative and qualitative measures of their LCR- and NSFR-related liquidity profile. These disclosures include major components used to calculate the LCR and NSFR (\ne.g.\n, HQLA, cash outflows and inflows for the LCR, and ASF and RSF for the NSFR, at the consolidated parent company), and a qualitative discussion of the BHC’s LCR and NSFR results, including, among other things, key drivers of the results, composition of HQLA and ASF, and concentration of funding sources.\nAs a Category III institution, PNC also is subject to Federal Reserve rules that require PNC to, among other things, conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the BHC’s 30-day liquidity stress test, and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets certain requirements.\nFor additional discussion of regulatory liquidity requirements, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.\nSource of Parent Company Liquidity and Dividends\n. The principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from PNC Bank. PNC Bank is subject to various restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to PNC Bancorp, Inc., its direct parent, which is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC Bank is also subject to federal laws limiting extensions of credit to its parent holding company and non-bank affiliates as discussed in Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the\n8\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nNotes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Further information on bank level liquidity and parent company liquidity is also available in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.\nFederal Reserve rules provide that a BHC is expected to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support such banks if necessary. Dodd-Frank requires that the Federal Reserve jointly adopt new rules with the OCC and the FDIC to implement this source of strength requirement. These joint rules have not yet been proposed. Consistent with this source of strength policy for subsidiary banks, the Federal Reserve has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a BHC generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the corporation’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, in providing guidance to the large BHCs participating in the CCAR exercise, discussed above, the Federal Reserve has expected capital plans to reflect conservative dividend payout ratios.\nEnhanced Prudential Requirements\n.\nUnder Federal Reserve rules, PNC and other BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more are subject to various enhanced prudential standards related to liquidity risk management and overall risk management. For PNC, these rules, among other things, establish liquidity stress testing requirements (discussed above), limitations on PNC’s aggregate net credit exposures to any single, unaffiliated company (referred to as the SCCL), and certain oversight and governance responsibilities for PNC’s Chief Risk Officer, the Board of Directors, and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the Federal Reserve’s SCCL rules, PNC’s aggregate net credit exposure (including exposure resulting from, among other transactions, extensions of credit, repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, investments in securities and derivative transactions) to any unaffiliated counterparty may not exceed 25% of PNC’s Tier 1 capital.\nThe Federal Reserve is required to impose a maximum 15-to-1 debt to equity ratio on a BHC if the federal agencies that comprise the FSOC determine that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the U.S. and that the imposition of such a debt-to-equity requirement would mitigate such risk. The Federal Reserve also is required to establish early remediation requirements for BHCs with more than $250 billion in total assets and continues to work towards finalizing these requirements.\nThe Federal Reserve may continue to develop the set of enhanced prudential standards that apply to large BHCs in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the U.S. financial system. For additional information, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nAdditional Powers Under the GLB Act\n. The GLB Act permits a qualifying BHC, such as PNC, to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in, or affiliate with companies engaging in, a broader range of financial activities than would otherwise be permitted for a BHC. Permitted affiliates include securities underwriters and dealers, insurance companies, insurance agents and companies engaged in other activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are determined by the Federal Reserve unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. We became a financial holding company in 2000. A BHC qualifies to become a financial holding company if the BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and its subsidiary depository institutions have a rating under the CRA of Satisfactory or better. Among other activities, we currently rely on our status as a financial holding company to conduct merchant banking activities and securities underwriting and dealing activities. As subsidiaries of a financial holding company under the GLB Act, our non-bank subsidiaries are generally allowed to conduct new financial activities, and we generally are permitted to acquire non-bank financial companies that have less than $10 billion in assets, with after-the-fact notice to the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition, the GLB Act permits qualifying national banks to engage in expanded activities through a “financial subsidiary.” PNC Bank has filed a financial subsidiary certification with the OCC and currently engages in insurance agency activities through financial subsidiaries. PNC Bank may also generally engage through a financial subsidiary in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve (other than insurance underwriting activities, insurance company investment activities and merchant banking). In order to establish a financial subsidiary, a national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must be “well capitalized” and “well managed” and the national bank and each of its depository institution affiliates must have a CRA rating of Satisfactory or better.\nIf a financial holding company or a national bank with a financial subsidiary fails to continue to meet the applicable “well capitalized” or “well managed” criteria, the financial holding company or national bank must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve or the OCC, respectively, that, among other things, identifies how the capital or management deficiencies will be corrected. Until such deficiencies are corrected, the relevant agency may impose limits or conditions on the activities of the company or bank, and the company or bank may not engage in, or acquire a company engaged in, the types of expanded activities only permissible for a financial holding company or financial subsidiary without prior approval of the relevant agency.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n9\nIn addition, a financial holding company generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new activity, if any of its insured depository institutions receives a CRA rating of less than Satisfactory. A national bank’s financial subsidiary generally may not engage in a new financial activity authorized by the GLB Act, or acquire a company engaged in such a new financial activity, if the national bank or any of its insured depository institution affiliates received a CRA rating of less than Satisfactory. At December 31, 2020, PNC Bank had an Outstanding rating with respect to CRA.\nIn 2020, the OCC finalized rules to modernize its regulations implementing the CRA. The rules significantly alter what activities by a bank qualify for CRA credit, where such activities must be conducted to receive credit, how the agencies measure a bank’s CRA performance, and how a bank must document and report its CRA qualifying activities.\nThe new rules would go into effect for PNC Bank on January 1, 2023.\nVolcker Rule\n.\nThe Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations prohibit banking entities from engaging in short-term trading as principal and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds, private equity funds, and certain other private funds (together, “covered funds”), unless an exemption or exception applies. For example, the exemptions under the Volcker Rule allow banking entities to trade as principal for securities underwriting, market making and risk-mitigating hedging purposes, subject to a variety of conditions. As a result of rule changes adopted in 2019, PNC and PNC Bank are subject to simplified and tailored compliance program requirements because each entity has trading assets and liabilities of less than $20 billion.\nTo date, the prohibitions under the final Volcker Rule regulations have not had a material effect on our businesses or revenue; however it is possible that the regulations may be modified in the future. Moreover, the conditions for engaging in exempted trading activities and having permissible relationships with a private fund under the regulations could, depending on the agencies’ approach to interpreting them, cause us to forego engaging in hedging or other transactions that we would otherwise undertake in the ordinary course of business and, thus, to some extent, may limit our ability to most effectively hedge our risks, manage our balance sheet or provide products or services to our customers. We also have divested prohibited investments in covered funds and received extensions allowing an extended conformance period for our remaining $0.1 billion interests in illiquid covered funds.\nOther Federal Reserve and OCC Regulation and Supervision\n. The federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective action as deemed appropriate based on the actions, operations or risk management programs of a BHC, an insured depository institution or their subsidiaries, and the Federal Reserve and the OCC have the ability to take enforcement action against PNC and PNC Bank, respectively, to prevent and remedy acts and practices that the agencies determine to be unfair or deceptive. A finding that we have engaged in a deceptive act or practice may have collateral consequences on our ability to rely on certain exemptions, or take advantage of certain provisions of, the securities laws absent a government waiver of such restrictions.\nMoreover, less than satisfactory examination ratings, lower capital ratios than peer group institutions, or regulatory concerns regarding management, controls, assets, operations or other factors can all potentially result in practical limitations on the ability of a bank or BHC to engage in new activities, grow, acquire new businesses, repurchase its stock or pay dividends, or continue to conduct existing activities. Furthermore, the OCC has established certain heightened risk management and governance standards for large banks, including PNC Bank. The guidelines, among other things, establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework, describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, internal audit, and the board of directors, and provide that a covered bank should have a comprehensive written statement that articulates its risk appetite and serves as a basis for the framework. If the OCC determines that a covered national bank is not in compliance with these or other enforceable guidelines (including guidelines relating to information security standards), the OCC may require the bank to submit a corrective action plan and may initiate enforcement action against the bank if an acceptable plan is not submitted or the bank fails to comply with an approved plan.\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s implementing regulation, Regulation W, place quantitative and qualitative restrictions on covered transactions between a bank and its affiliates (for example between PNC Bank, on the one hand, and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the other hand). In general, Section 23A and Regulation W limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and any single affiliate to 10% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, limit the total amount of covered transactions between a bank and all its affiliates to 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus, prohibit a bank from purchasing low-quality assets from an affiliate, and require certain covered transactions to be secured with prescribed amounts of collateral. Section 23B generally requires that transactions between a bank and its affiliates be on terms that are at least as favorable to the bank as the terms that would apply in comparable transactions between the bank and a third party. Dodd-Frank amended Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act to include as a covered transaction the credit exposure of a bank to an affiliate arising from a derivative transaction with the affiliate. The Federal Reserve has yet to propose rules to implement these revisions.\n10\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve regulations also place quantitative limitations and conditions on extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders and their related interests (including any company controlled by such persons).\nGenerally, extensions of credit by a bank to such individuals, companies, and related interests must comply with certain individual and aggregate lending limits, as well as procedural and qualitative requirements.\nAs a result of the amount of PNC common stock held by its advised mutual funds and other accounts, the Vanguard Group is considered a principal shareholder of PNC Bank for purposes of these regulations.\nThe federal banking agencies have issued an interagency statement addressing the application of these insider lending restrictions to the other portfolio companies owned or controlled by the advised funds and accounts of a fund complex that could be considered a principal shareholder of a bank, which is effective through January 1, 2022.\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided guidance regarding incentive and other elements of compensation provided to executives and other employees at banking organizations they regulate, both as general industry-wide guidance and guidance specific to select larger companies, including PNC. These guidelines are intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of covered banking organizations do not encourage excessive risk-taking. Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC and two other regulatory agencies to adopt regulations governing incentive compensation provided by regulated financial services companies to their executives and other employees. These agencies jointly proposed regulations in 2011 and again in 2016 to implement these requirements. Final regulations have not been adopted.\nThe trust, investment advisory and other fiduciary activities conducted by PNC Bank also are subject to the OCC’s regulations governing the fiduciary activities of national banks, as well as applicable state fiduciary laws. The OCC’s regulations, among other things, set standards for the administration of fiduciary accounts, prohibit or govern potential conflicts of interests, and establish recordkeeping requirements for fiduciary accounts.\nThe Federal Reserve’s prior approval is required whenever we propose to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of any bank or BHC, or to merge or consolidate with any other BHC. The BHC Act and other federal law enumerates the factors the Federal Reserve must consider when reviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or BHC. These factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the U.S.; the organizations’ compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the records of performance under the CRA of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction.\nThe Federal Reserve’s prior approval also is required, and similar factors are considered, for a BHC to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a savings association or savings and loan holding company, or to merge or consolidate with a savings and loan holding company. In cases involving interstate bank acquisitions, the Federal Reserve also must consider the concentration of deposits nationwide and in certain individual states. A BHC is generally prohibited from merging or consolidating with, or acquiring, another company or bank if upon consummation the resulting company would control 10% or more of deposits in the U.S. or a state, or if the resulting company’s liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate liabilities of the U.S. financial sector (including the U.S. liabilities of foreign financial companies). In extraordinary cases, the FSOC, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, could order the break-up of financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to the financial stability of the U.S.\nOCC prior approval is required for PNC Bank to acquire another insured bank or savings association by merger or to acquire deposits or substantially all of the assets of such institutions. In deciding whether to approve such a transaction, the OCC is required to consider factors similar to those that must be considered by the Federal Reserve in connection with the acquisition of a bank or BHC. Approval of the OCC and the FDIC is required to merge a nonbank entity into PNC Bank. PNC and PNC Bank have requested the prior approval of the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively, to acquire BBVA and BBVA USA, and to merge BBVA with and into PNC and BBVA USA with and into PNC Bank.\nIn 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized rules governing when a BHC is presumed to “control” another company for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby causing the company to be considered a subsidiary for purposes of the BHC Act. The rules establish a set of presumptions identifying when a BHC would be deemed to control another company, with the nature and scope of relationships a BHC may have with a non-controlled company (e.g., director or officer representatives, scope of business relationships, etc.) declining as the BHC’s voting ownership percentage in the company increases.\nFDIC Insurance and Related Matters\n. PNC Bank is insured by the FDIC and subject to deposit premium assessments. Regulatory matters could increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk based.” Therefore, higher fee percentages would be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. These risk profiles take into account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the primary federal banking regulator through its\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n11\nexamination and supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings of assets or liabilities classified as higher risk by the FDIC, including brokered deposits. A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank and result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category.\nPNC Bank is subject to certain enhanced deposit insurance recordkeeping requirements adopted by the FDIC, which are designed to assist the FDIC to promptly determine whether, or to what extent, a large bank’s deposits are covered by deposit insurance if the bank were to fail. These requirements became effective on April 1, 2020. Banks may request an extension of this compliance date in certain circumstances for up to one year.\nFederal banking laws and regulations also apply a variety of requirements or restrictions on insured depository institutions with respect to brokered deposits. For instance, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, brokered deposits are generally subject to higher outflow assumptions than other types of deposits for purposes of the LCR. In December 2020, the FDIC finalized rules that establish a new framework for determining whether deposits are considered “brokered.”\nResolution and Recovery Planning.\nBHCs that have $100 billion or more in assets, such as PNC, are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan (including a public summary) that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose restrictions on a covered BHC, including additional capital requirements or limitations on growth, if the agencies jointly determine that the company’s plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or other applicable resolution framework), and additionally could require the company to divest assets or take other actions if the company did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed. PNC generally must file a resolution plan with the Federal Reserve and FDIC at least once each three-year period, with submissions alternating between a full plan and a plan targeted on certain areas or subjects identified by the agencies.\nPNC’s next resolution plan is scheduled to be a targeted plan and is due to be filed by December 17, 2021. The agencies, however, have reserved the ability to alter the scheduled filing date for a covered company, request an interim update before a covered company’s next scheduled filing date and require a covered company to submit a full resolution plan in lieu of a scheduled targeted plan.\nThe FDIC also requires large insured depository institutions, including PNC Bank, to periodically submit a resolution plan (including a public summary) to the FDIC that includes, among other things, an analysis of how the institution could be resolved under the FDI Act in a manner that protects depositors and limits losses or costs to creditors of the bank in accordance with the FDI Act. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted the moratorium that it had instituted on resolution plan filings by insured depository institutions, but it is unclear at this time when PNC Bank’s next resolution plan will be due. Depending on how the agencies conduct their review of the resolution plans submitted by PNC and PNC Bank, these requirements could affect the ways in which PNC structures and conducts its business and result in higher compliance and operating costs.\nPNC Bank also is subject to OCC guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning. These guidelines require a covered bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that is evaluated and updated annually that, among other things, identifies a range of options that could be undertaken by the covered bank to restore its financial strength and viability should identified triggering events occur. The recovery plan guidelines are enforceable in the same manner as the other guidelines the OCC has established.\nCFPB Regulation and Supervision\n. The CFPB examines PNC and PNC Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to deposit products, credit card, mortgage, automobile, student and other consumer loans, and other consumer financial products and services that we offer. The consumer financial protection laws that are subject to the CFPB’s supervision and enforcement powers include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive, and to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service.\nThe CFPB may issue regulations that impact products and services offered by PNC or PNC Bank. The regulations could reduce the fees that we receive, require that we provide additional consumer disclosures, alter the way we provide our products and services, impair our ability to compete with other providers of financial products or services, or expose us to greater risk of private litigation or regulatory enforcement action. The CFPB has engaged in rulemakings that affect, among other things, consumer remittance transfers, the qualified mortgage definition under the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Debt Collection\n12\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nPractices Act, and payday, vehicle title, and certain high-cost installment loans and may establish, or modify, rules governing other aspects of consumer financial products or services in the future.\nSecurities and Derivatives Regulation\nOur registered broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to the Exchange Act, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, respectively, and related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These rules, for example, require that broker-dealers and investment advisers act in a customer’s best interest when making investment recommendations to retail customers, which includes managing conflicts of interest, providing required disclosures and exercising a duty of care in making investment recommendations. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory organization for our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions.\nThe SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations also can affect our ability to expeditiously issue new securities into the capital markets. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history and supervisory concerns.\nPNC Bank is provisionally registered as swap dealer with the CFTC. Because of the limited volume of our security-based swap dealing activities, PNC Bank has not registered (and currently does not intend to register) with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\nPNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses are subject to the regulations and requirements imposed on CFTC-registered swap dealers, and the CFTC (and for certain delegated responsibilities, the National Futures Association) has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to PNC Bank’s derivatives and foreign exchange businesses. The CFTC’s comprehensive and significant regulations are intended to (i) address systemic risk issues, (ii) bring greater transparency to the derivatives and foreign exchange markets, (iii) provide enhanced disclosures and protections to customers and (iv) promote market integrity. Among other things, these regulations (i) require that, absent certain specified exemptions, most standardized swaps be centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house and be traded on a centralized exchange or swap execution facility; (ii) subject PNC Bank to capital requirements in excess of historical practice; (iii) subject PNC Bank to comprehensive recordkeeping, regulatory reporting and real-time public reporting requirements; (iv) subject PNC Bank to various business conduct requirements, including the provision of daily marks to counterparties and disclosing to counterparties (pre-execution) the material risks, material incentives, and any conflicts of interest associated with their swap; (v) impose special duties on PNC Bank when transacting a swap with a “special entity” (e.g., governmental agency (federal, state or local) or political subdivision thereof, pension plan or endowment); and (vi) impose margin requirements on certain swaps that are not centrally cleared through a regulated clearing house.\nThe regulations and requirements applicable to PNC Bank, as a provisionally registered CFTC swap dealer, have and will continue to impose compliance burdens on PNC Bank and introduce additional legal risks (including as a result of applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). In addition, failure to comply with the “pay-to-play” regulations that govern our swap and municipal securities businesses could result in limitations on PNC Bank’s ability to conduct swap and municipal securities business with state or local governments and their authorities.\nRegulations of Other Agencies\nIn addition to regulations issued by the federal banking, securities and derivatives regulators, we also are subject to regulations issued by other federal agencies with respect to certain financial products and services we offer. For example, certain of our fiduciary, brokerage and investment management activities are subject to regulations issued by the Department of Labor under ERISA and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and certain of our student lending and servicing activities are subject to regulation by the Department of Education.\nCompetition\nWe are subject to intense competition from other regulated banking organizations, as well as various other types of financial institutions and non-bank entities that can offer a number of similar products and services without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions.\nPNC Bank competes for deposits and/or loans with:\n•\nOther commercial banks,\n•\nSavings banks,\n•\nCredit unions,\n•\nConsumer finance companies,\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n13\n•\nLeasing companies,\n•\nOther non-bank lenders,\n•\nFinancial technology companies,\n•\nTreasury management service companies,\n•\nInsurance companies, and\n•\nIssuers of commercial paper and other securities, including mutual funds.\nIn providing asset management services, our businesses compete with:\n•\nInvestment management firms,\n•\nLarge banks and other financial institutions,\n•\nBrokerage firms,\n•\nFinancial technology companies,\n•\nMutual fund complexes, and\n•\nInsurance companies.\nOur various non-bank businesses engaged in investment banking and alternative investment activities compete with:\n•\nCommercial banks,\n•\nInvestment banking firms,\n•\nCollateralized loan obligation managers,\n•\nHedge funds,\n•\nMutual fund complexes,\n•\nMerchant banks,\n•\nInsurance companies,\n•\nPrivate equity firms, and\n•\nOther investment vehicles.\nCompetition is based on a number of factors including pricing, product structure, the range of products and services offered and the quality of customer service. Loan pricing, structure and credit standards are extremely important as we seek to achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Deposit-taking activities are also subject to pricing pressures and to customer migration as a result of intense competition for deposits and investments. Competitors may seek to compete with us through traditional channels such as physical locations or through digital channels such as the internet or mobile applications. We include here by reference the additional information regarding competition and factors affecting our competitive position included in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nHuman Capital\nEmployees totaled 51,257 at December 31, 2020. This total included 49,549 full-time and 1,708 part-time employees, of which 27,621 full-time and 1,611 part-time employees were employed in our Retail Banking business.\nPart of PNC’s ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and retain and develop our existing employees. In support of our employees, our strategic human capital goals include:\n•\nAdvancing PNC’s talent-focused culture by developing strong leaders who exemplify our Leadership Standards, a set of standards designed to hold managers accountable for intentional inclusion, living our Corporate Values, enabling change, achieving results and developing the best talent and providing them with the tools and insights to effectively manage our people.\n•\nFocusing on the development and retention of diverse, high performing talent and providing employees with opportunities for professional growth, career mobility and health and financial wellness.\n•\nSupporting a strong, ethical culture anchored in our Corporate Values and doing the right thing for our employees, customers and shareholders.\n•\nContinuing to focus on improving workforce diversity and creating an equitable and inclusive work place.\nIn managing our employees, we focus on these key factors:\n•\nRecruiting, developing and retaining talent\n. We believe recruiting, developing and retaining talent starts with our leaders and we measure our managers against our Leadership Standards. Our talent acquisition priority is to invest in the development of our internal talent and to provide career advancement opportunities to our employees. We measure how many open requisitions we fill with internal candidates, participation in early career development programs and turnover. At our first-level and above career bands we fill approximately 62% of our open requisitions with internal candidates, which has a direct impact on our ability to retain and develop our people. In addition, we hire approximately 500 interns and 500 full-time development program associates each year from our 11 early career development programs that support each of our lines of business and support areas.\n14\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n•\nDiversity, equity and inclusion\n. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining a diverse workforce that reflects and is equipped to meet the needs of our diverse customer base. We measure representation of LGBTQ+, people with disabilities, veterans, women and across all races and certain ethnicities as self-disclosed by our employees. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 59% of PNC’s workforce and 50% of PNC’s employees in managerial roles were women. People of color represented approximately 29% of PNC’s workforce, including 22% of our employees in managerial roles, as of December 31, 2020.\n•\nTotal rewards\n. We design our compensation and benefits programs to focus on three key aspects of employee well-being: health, money and quality of life. These programs include competitive base salaries and, depending on eligibility, cash incentive or stock-based award opportunities, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan with employer match, a pension plan, healthcare, life insurance and disability benefits, health savings and dependent care flexible spending accounts, paid time off, paid maternity and parental leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, a robust wellness program with incentives, adoption assistance, employee assistance programs, educational assistance and on-site health care and child care services, among others. Additionally, we conduct pay equity analyses to determine if employees are being compensated fairly and consistently across roles.\n•\nEmployee engagement\n. Twice a year, PNC conducts employee surveys to measure employee engagement because we believe that engaged employees have lower attrition rates and improved customer outcomes.\nPNC continues to recognize the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will likely continue to have on our Human Capital. For more information on COVID-19 related impacts to our Human Capital, see the \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\" section of this Item 1.\nSEC Reports and Corporate Governance Information\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, we file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC.

    "text": "We are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services company, certain elements of risk are inherent in what we do and the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. We discuss our principal risk management oversight and processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance and other metrics in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.\nThe following are the material risk factors that affect us of which we are currently aware. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, these risks present other possible adverse consequences, including those described below. These risk factors and other risks we face are also discussed further in other sections of this Report. Thus, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nSummary\nThe following is a summary of the Risk Factors disclosure in this Item 1A:\n•\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.\n•\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic conditions.\n•\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies and the impact of government legislation, regulation and policy and other political factors on the economy, interest rates, overall financial market performance and banking organizations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance and our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.\n•\nThe likely discontinuance of the submission of rates for the calculation of LIBOR presents risks to the financial instruments originated, held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\n•\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\n•\nWe are subject to risks related to the use of technology which is critical to our ability to maintain or enhance the competitiveness of our businesses and is dependent on having the right to use the underlying intellectual property. We could\n16\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nalso suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of our information systems and other technology, including as a result of third party breaches of data security either at PNC or at third parties handling PNC information.\n•\nOur business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties, by market interest rates and movements in those rates and changes in the values of financial assets.\n•\nWe are subject to risks related to inaccurate estimates and assumptions, such as those used in our asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments, and to risks related to poorly designed and implemented models that are extensively used in our business.\n•\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and our success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and talented employees and we are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.\n•\nWe are subject to operational risks as a result of our dependence on the effectiveness and integrity of our employees and on third party vendors, service providers and other counterparties over whom we do not have direct control.\n•\nWe are subject to risks related to growing our business in part by acquiring other financial services business from time to time as these acquisitions, including the pending acquisition of BBVA, present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.\nStarting in early 2020 and continuing into 2021, federal, state and local governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by enacting a variety of measures to manage the related public health effects, including restricting travel, limiting the conduct of businesses and controlling individual interactions such as through required social distancing measures. Collectively, these measures, together with voluntary changes in behavior, led to a substantial decrease in economic activity and a dramatic increase in unemployment in the second quarter of 2020. Governmental bodies also enacted laws designed to stabilize the economy and provide relief to businesses and individuals to mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 and the policies restricting the operation of businesses and the movement of individuals.\nWhile economic conditions have improved, economic activity remains below its pre-pandemic level, with the partial recovery inconsistent across different geographic regions, sectors, companies and individuals and subject to setbacks as conditions related to the pandemic fluctuate. If efforts to contain COVID-19 are unsuccessful and restrictions on businesses and activities continue in place for extended periods or are increased, the recovery would likely be much weaker and the economy could fall back into recession. While several vaccines have been approved for use and others remain in development or clinical trials, significant uncertainty remains regarding the speed with which effective vaccines can be manufactured and widely distributed and the willingness of individuals to get vaccinated. As a result, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the length and severity of the pandemic and the strength or reversal of the economic rebound, including whether there will be additional fiscal stimulus from the federal government and, if so, its size, scope and effectiveness. Accordingly, the outbreak and its consequences, including responsive measures to manage it, had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance. The longer the public health crisis lasts and the greater its severity, the greater the likely adverse impact on the economy, our customers and our business and financial performance. The following are examples of the most likely impacts on PNC:\n•\nThe deterioration of national and global economic conditions and elevated levels of unemployment have negatively affected and are likely to continue to negatively affect, possibly materially, our financial performance and operations. The following are the key factors contributing to this risk:\n◦\nThere is a greater likelihood that more of our commercial and consumer customers or counterparties will become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to us, which, in turn, will result in a higher level of non-performing loans and net charge-offs, particularly in the sectors most adversely impacted by the pandemic. Even if a loan returns to full performing status, it may be on modified terms that result in, for example, a term extension, interest rate reduction or principal deferral or forgiveness. Increases in loan delinquencies or modifications will also result in increased administrative costs. In addition, given the uncertainty about the length and severity of the pandemic and the strength or reversal of the economic rebound, our provision for credit losses may be more volatile period-to-period with a corresponding increase in period-to-period volatility in our net income.\n◦\nThere has been and there is likely to continue to be a decrease in the demand for certain of our products and services which could be further exacerbated if customers lose confidence due to concerns regarding the economy. We have also waived certain fees associated with our products and services for customers affected by the pandemic and may continue to do so. In addition, while customer deposits have grown aiding our liquidity, future changes in behavior resulting in declining deposit balances would likely increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income and liquidity resources.\n◦\nThese rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions have impacted and may continue to impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements, as well as causing substantial reductions\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n17\nin the value of our assets under management, all with the possible effects described in the Risk Factor headed “Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.”\n◦\nAlthough PNC’s capital levels continue to be strong, the degradation in economic conditions also has and is likely to continue to negatively affect our capital position, possibly materially, which is critical to our ability to operate and grow our business. In addition, continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in the financial markets or long-lasting or deeper recessionary conditions may diminish our access to the capital markets or result in or contribute to downgrades of our credit ratings. We have suspended our discretionary common share repurchase program and may take further actions that would limit a return of capital to shareholders, including potentially a reduction or suspension of the dividend payable to common shareholders, as a result of these conditions and their effect on our financial performance and position or as a result of regulatory guidance.\n•\nSome of the legislation responsive to the outbreak, including the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, provides for certain commercial and consumer protections which have altered and may continue to alter the profitability of the transactions in which we engage, such as by allowing borrowers to delay payments on loans or other obligations and imposing other costs on us. These laws have also delayed and restricted and may continue to delay or restrict our ability to realize the value of collateral by, for example, providing temporary foreclosure protection and eviction protection even when customers are in breach of their obligations to us. These laws may be extended or increased in scope, and other laws may be enacted in response to the pandemic that have similar or broader effects on us. We may also be limited in our ability to realize the value of collateral as a result of court closures and related delays. Moreover, collateral may be liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of exposure to us as a result of deteriorating economic conditions and volatile markets. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for more information on PNC’s implementation of these programs.\n•\nOther laws related to employee benefits and the treatment of employees have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact us by increasing administrative, compensation and benefits costs by, for example, mandating coverage of certain COVID-19 related testing and treatment or mandating additional paid or unpaid leave. Further governmental action that is taken to mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic, as well as additional compensation or benefit actions taken by PNC, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, possibly materially, in other ways that are not known now.\n•\nIn response to the outbreak and its economic consequences, the Federal Reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25% and has signaled that it expects to keep interest rates at a low level for through at least 2023. As a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, this change in interest rates has had and likely will continue to have a negative impact on our net interest income and net interest margin, which could be material and which could materially adversely affect our profitability. The effects of a low interest rate environment are further described in the Risk Factor headed “Our business and financial performance are impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates.”\n•\nTo protect our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate, we modified the operations of many of our retail branches, including temporarily closing some branches, limiting operations to drive-through only in other locations, and otherwise implemented work-from-home policies for a significant portion of our workforce. While our retail operations have largely re-opened, we cannot guarantee that our branches will continue to remain open if the outbreak worsens or there is an increase in governmental restrictions. Our non-branch based workforce continues to work primarily remotely. We believe we are capable of substantially meeting the needs of our customers despite these modifications. However, these efforts may result in the loss of customers, impede our ability to perform certain transactions, and impair our ability to effectively identify, manage and control risk. For example, customers may be unwilling or unable to conduct transactions with us via online channels or through a local branch that is operating only in a drive-through mode. Another example is the infrastructure needed to provide products and services via online channels or to work effectively in a work-from-home environment, such as internet, telecommunications and internal information technology systems, may fail to perform as anticipated, resulting in our inability to deliver products or services or effectively manage the risks arising from our businesses. In addition, we rely on our employees, third party vendors and service providers and other counterparties, both domestically and abroad, to support many aspects of our business. Reduced workforces which may be caused by, but not limited to, illness, quarantine, stay at home or other government mandates, or difficulties transitioning back to an in office environment, could result in an adverse impact to our operations and financial performance. Redeployment of employees from current positions and of technology from current uses to support products and services responsive to the outbreak may further adversely impact our operations. Further, third party vendors, service providers and other counterparties, both domestically and abroad, face access, connectivity or other challenges operating within a work-from-home virtual environment.\n•\nIn support of our employees, customers and communities, we may take steps beyond or in addition to those required by governmental or regulatory minimums which may further adversely impact our profitability. For example, we have provided and may continue to provide additional relief or forbearance to customers, health and wellness benefits to employees (including significant company approved leave) or financial support for community initiatives to assist those in need as a result of the outbreak. The actual or perceived failure to provide sufficient services, support or relief to those businesses or individuals in need or properly implement legislation responsive to the outbreak or our voluntary commitments could negatively impact our reputation with adverse consequences to our business. In addition, such actual or perceived failure, or\n18\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\noperational and other issues that arise in connection with the implementation of government-mandated or other financial assistance or relief programs present elevated levels of legal and reputational risk, including governmental and regulatory inquiries, investigations and enforcement actions, as well as private lawsuits. Participation by PNC in governmental programs designed to provide liquidity to the financial system or impacted businesses, such as borrowing through the Federal Reserve discount window or borrowing from, or selling financial assets to, facilities established by the Federal Reserve or participation in programs under the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, such as the PPP, also have exposed and may continue to expose us to governmental investigation and action or public scrutiny and criticism, either at the time we participate in the program or subsequently.\nRefer to our other Risk Factors in this Item 1A for information regarding other factors that have and are likely to continue to affect our business and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.\nRisks Related to the Economy and Other External Factors, Including Regulation\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic conditions.\nAs a financial services company, our business and overall financial performance are affected to a significant extent by economic conditions, primarily in the U.S.\nDeclining or adverse economic conditions and adverse changes in investor, consumer, and business sentiment generally result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the demand for our products and services or reduce the number of creditworthy borrowers. The ability of borrowers to repay loans is often weakened as a result of economic downturns and higher unemployment. Such economic conditions also may lead to turmoil and volatility in financial markets, often with at least some financial asset categories losing value. Any of these effects would likely have an adverse impact on financial institutions such as PNC, with the significance of the impact generally depending on the nature and severity of the adverse economic conditions.\nEven when economic conditions are relatively good or stable, specific economic factors can negatively affect our business and performance. This can be especially true when the factors relate to particular segments of the economy. For example, shifting consumer behavior with respect to retail purchases being made over the internet rather than in physical stores has negatively impacted performance by some retailers. This likely decreases demand for financial services in that sector, possibly harming the creditworthiness of some shopping mall operators, retail companies and others with whom we do business. As another example, dislocations in international trade, such as increased tariffs and interruptions in international supply chains likely adversely affect companies that are relatively dependent on imports or exports, impacting prices and demand for goods or services. Affected companies may experience lower levels of business and possible declining creditworthiness as compared to companies less dependent on international trade.\nGiven the geographic scope of our business and operations, we are most exposed to issues within the U.S. economy and financial markets. Within the U.S., we are currently most exposed to issues primarily within markets located in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. Following the proposed acquisition of BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, this footprint will expand particularly to include a larger presence in the Southwest and West Coast, thereby increasing our exposure to regional economic issues in those areas.\nOur foreign business activities continue to be a relatively small part of our overall business. As a result, the direct impact on our business and performance from economic conditions outside the U.S. is not likely to be significant, although the impact would increase if we expand our foreign business more than nominally. We are, however, susceptible to the risk that such economic conditions could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Primarily, this risk results from the possibility that poor economic conditions or financial market disruptions affecting other major economies would also affect the U.S.\nThroughout the remainder of this Risk Factors section, we address specific ways in which economic issues could create risk for us and result in adverse impacts on our business and financial performance. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to economic issues of the types described here and presents the risk of further such impacts. See the immediately preceding Risk Factor for a discussion of risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impact of government legislation, regulation and policy and other political factors on the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nChanges in law or governmental policy affecting the economy, business activity, or personal spending, investing or saving activities may cause consumers and businesses to alter behavior in ways that impact demand for our products and services. Such changes may also alter the profitability of the transactions in which we engage or result in increased regulatory burden and associated costs. PNC may alter the types or terms of the products and services we offer to reflect such changes. Uncertainty regarding future law or policy may have similar impacts. The recent election of a new U.S. President, together with some changes in the membership of Congress,\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n19\nincluding change in control of the Senate, will likely lead to changes in law or policy, including the level of regulation of financial institutions and the enforcement environment. Moreover, a change in regulatory practices that increases the time frames to obtain regulatory approvals for acquisitions and other activities or makes them more difficult to obtain could affect our ability to make acquisitions or introduce new products and services.\nConcern regarding the ability of Congress and the President, which increases to the extent government is divided, collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary matters (including the debt ceiling), or prolonged stalemates leading to total or partial governmental shutdowns, also can have adverse economic consequences and create the risk of economic instability or market volatility, with potential adverse consequences to our business and financial performance.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, which are important to our business and financial performance.\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of financial companies such as PNC. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to monitor the national supply of bank credit and set certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits. Rates of interest can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.\nIn addition, monetary policy actions by governmental authorities in the European Union or other countries could have an impact on global interest rates, which could affect rates in the U.S. as well as rates on instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, any of which could have one or more of the potential effects on us described above.\nSome of the potential impacts on our business and results of governmental monetary policy are described in Risk Factors under the heading “Risks Related to the Business of Banking.” The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark rates to historically low levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See the Risk Factor headed “The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.”\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and comprehensive oversight by a variety of regulatory agencies and enforcement authorities. These regulations and the manner in which they are implemented can have a significant impact on our businesses and operations and our ability to grow and expand.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a BHC and a financial holding company, with the Federal Reserve as its primary regulator. PNC Bank is a federally chartered bank, with the OCC as its primary regulator. In addition, our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple other banking, consumer protection, securities and derivatives regulatory bodies. We are also subject to the jurisdiction of criminal and civil enforcement authorities.\nAs a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations involving both our business and organization, with multiple regulators or agencies having supervisory or enforcement oversight over aspects of our business. These laws, regulations and supervisory activities are intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. In addition to regulation in the U.S., we are also subject to foreign regulation to a limited extent as a result of our business activities outside the U.S.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict our permissible activities and investments and require compliance with provisions designed to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We also are subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities.\nOver time, the scope of the laws and regulations affecting our businesses, as well as the number of requirements or limitations imposed by legislative or regulatory actions, has increased, and we expect to continue to face substantial regulatory oversight and new or revised regulatory requirements or initiatives. Legislative or regulatory actions can result in increased compliance costs, reduced business opportunities, or new requirements and limitations on how we conduct our business.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or creditors.\nThe results of routine and non-routine supervisory or examination activities by our regulators, including actual or perceived compliance failures, could result in limitations on our ability to enter into certain transactions, engage in new activities, expand geographically, make acquisitions, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. These activities also could result\n20\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nin significant fines, penalties, or required corrective actions, some of which could be expensive and difficult to implement. As we expand our product and service offerings into additional states or countries, either through organic growth or acquisition, we will face increases in state or foreign regulation affecting our operations. Different approaches to regulation by different jurisdictions could materially increase our compliance costs or risks of non-compliance.\nA failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements and expectations exposes us to the risk of damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory or enforcement actions or consequences, such as limitations on activities otherwise permissible for us or additional requirements for engaging in new activities, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.\nSee the immediately following Risk Factor for a discussion of risks associated with capital and liquidity regulation. Also see Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for more information concerning the regulation of PNC, including those areas that have been receiving a high level of regulatory focus. Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report also discusses some of the regulation applicable to us.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity standards that affect our business, operations and ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.\nPNC and PNC Bank are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. These regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are typically developed at an international level by the Basel Committee and then applied, with adjustments, in each country by the appropriate domestic regulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory agencies have the ability to apply stricter capital and liquidity standards than those developed by Basel Committee. In several instances, the U.S. banking agencies have done so with respect to U.S. banking organizations.\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of capital and liquidity, and regulatory expectations as to the quality of our capital and liquidity, impact our business activities and may prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders or force us to take actions contrary to their interests. For example, PNC’s ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders is subject to PNC’s compliance with its SCB, which is determined at least annually through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process. The Federal Reserve also has imposed additional limitations on capital distributions through the first quarter of 2021 by CCAR participating BHCs (including PNC) and may extend these limitations, potentially in modified form. In addition, capital and liquidity requirements may impact the amount and type of loans we make. We may be constrained in our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. We may be forced to sell or refrain from acquiring assets where the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets’ underlying risks. In addition, liquidity standards require us to maintain holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets, even if more desirable from an earnings, balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective.\nThe Basel Committee continues to engage in capital- and liquidity-related initiatives. For example, the Basel Committee in 2017 finalized additional, significant changes to the international capital framework for banking organizations. See the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report. As it is unclear, at this time, whether or how these initiatives will be implemented in the U.S., we are unable to estimate what potential impact such initiatives may have on us.\nIn 2020, the regulatory agencies issued a rule permitting banks to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing the CECL accounting standard. PNC elected to adopt this optional transition provision effective March 31, 2020. As a result, our regulatory capital does not currently reflect the full impact of CECL.\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements are subject to regular review and revision by the Basel Committee and the U.S. banking agencies. Future changes to the capital and liquidity rules may require PNC or PNC Bank to maintain more or higher quality capital or greater liquidity, which would likely increase some of the potential adverse effects described above.\nThe regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards that are applicable to PNC are discussed in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report and the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.\nThe likely discontinuance of the submission of rates for the calculation of LIBOR presents risks to the financial instruments originated, held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate\n.\nAs a large financial institution, a significant portion of our transactions involve variable or adjusting interest rates that are calculated by adding a contractually defined credit spread to a base or reference rate. For many years, LIBOR has been used as a reference rate for a substantial majority of our transactions involving variable or adjustable interest, including those in which we lend money, issue securities, or purchase and sell securities issued by others, as well as many derivative transactions that we enter into to manage our or our customers’ risk. We also service financial instruments entered into by others that use LIBOR as the reference rate.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n21\nLIBOR is derived from the rates at which LIBOR panel banks borrow from other global banks. LIBOR is accordingly viewed as a “credit-sensitive” rate as the rates submitted by panel banks on which LIBOR is based reflect the credit risk associated with the submitting banks.\nWe currently anticipate that non-USD LIBOR will cease to be available after year end 2021 and that the most widely used USD LIBOR tenor settings will cease after June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve and other official sector representatives have also communicated guidance that supervised institutions should stop entering into new USD LIBOR contracts no later than year end 2021. Accordingly, we are preparing for the likelihood of LIBOR cessation.\nAt present, SOFR is expected to be the alternative reference rate that will replace LIBOR for most types of transactions.\nSOFR is viewed as a “riskless rate” as it is derived from rates on overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase transactions, which are essentially overnight loans secured by U.S. Treasury securities, which are largely viewed as not presenting credit risk. Because SOFR is an overnight rate derived from observations of actual transactions, the rate can be volatile, especially if there are disruptions in the underlying repurchase market, but any daily volatility historically does not create volatility when rates are cumulatively measured over customary LIBOR terms (e.g., one month or three months).\nChanging to SOFR or another riskless rate could result in a value transfer between contracting parties to instruments originally based on LIBOR. Historically, in periods of economic or financial industry stress, riskless rates that are analogous to SOFR have been relatively stable. In contrast, LIBOR, which is designed to reflect the credit risk of banks, has widened relative to riskless rates, reflecting increased uncertainty regarding the credit-worthiness of banks. Accordingly, assuming that SOFR will behave like its historical analogs, an instrument that transitions from LIBOR to SOFR may not yield identical economic outcomes for each contracting party to an instrument had the instrument continued to reference LIBOR. Similarly, SOFR, because it is riskless, tends to be a lower rate than LIBOR. To address these differences between LIBOR and SOFR, certain industry recommended LIBOR fallback provisions include a concept of an adjustment spread that is applied when a LIBOR-based contract falls back to SOFR and that is calculated based on a five-year median look-back of the historical spot difference between the applicable LIBOR tenor and the applicable SOFR tenor. However, because any such adjustment spread will be based on a historical median, it is likely that the adjustment spread may not reflect the spot difference between LIBOR and SOFR at certain points in time and there may be a value transfer between the contracting parties over the life of the instrument because the all-in rate applied to a contract, even taking into account the spread adjustment, might have behaved differently over the life of the instrument in the absence of LIBOR cessation.\nAny value transfer could be financially adverse or beneficial to us or to our other contracting parties to that instrument (such as a borrower, derivative counterparty, or bond holder). Impacts from a change in reference rate would likely include changes to the yield on, and value of, loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into and the trading market for LIBOR-based securities. Any theoretical benefit to us could result in counterparty dissatisfaction, which, in turn could lead to litigation, potentially as class actions, or other adverse consequences, including dissatisfied customers or impaired relationships with financial institution counterparties resulting in loss of business. As a result, over the life of a transaction that transitions from LIBOR to a new reference rate, our monetary obligations to our counterparty (or their obligations to us) and the yield we receive (or pay) from the transaction with that counterparty may change from that which would have resulted from a continuation of LIBOR.\nAnother set of risks associated with LIBOR cessation relates to how the transition from LIBOR to another rate will be effected. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to a new reference rate may be challenging, especially where the contract does not provide for a transition upon LIBOR cessation or the relevant contractual language relating to a potential transition is ambiguous or inadequate under the circumstances.\nFor example, the vast majority of LIBOR-based interest rate derivative contracts executed prior to January 25, 2021, do not include adequate fallbacks for LIBOR cessation. In response, the industry trade group for derivatives (ISDA), published a protocol pursuant to which industry participants can agree with any other industry participant that adheres to the protocol to include ISDA’s new LIBOR fallback provisions into legacy derivatives contracts. Although we have adhered to the ISDA protocol, it is possible that many “end users” of swaps, i.e., our borrowers who have hedged their interest rate payment obligations, may not adhere. In addition, there are differences between the new ISDA fallback provisions and the fallback provisions that have been proposed for loans, which differences could result in a mismatch between the reference rate or other economics in our borrowers’ legacy derivatives contracts and their loans for which such derivatives contracts are intended as a hedge. For these end-user counterparties, one-on-one negotiation with each counterparty will be necessary in order to amend legacy swaps to adequately address LIBOR cessation. If we are unable to agree to appropriate LIBOR cessation provisions with these swaps counterparties, there will be uncertainty as to how to value and effect our rights and obligations under our legacy swap contracts. Although legislative solutions to address LIBOR cessation in derivative contracts have been proposed, there is no assurance such solutions will be implemented, and we may seek to negotiate with impacted counterparties or, if not possible, effect reference rate transition through other means. Addressing transition under these circumstances may be challenging or ineffective, could result in litigation, and in some cases may involve concession on our part that has the effect of reducing the value of the instrument to us.\n22\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nWe have other contracts that do contemplate LIBOR cessation but do so in a manner that may create other risks. For example, some contracts provide for selecting replacement rates in a manner that presents significant challenges (such as by assuming that there would be a rate calculated substantially in the same manner as LIBOR is) or that gives us or another party absolute discretion to select a rate. Some provide for determination of a reference rate without providing for adjustment of the credit spread. In these types of cases, there will likely be uncertainty surrounding transition, with all of the risks described in this Risk Factor.\nTransitioning from LIBOR to alternative rates also may result in operational errors during the transition such that the replacement rate is not applied in a timely manner or is incorrectly applied. This is particularly true given the volume of contracts that will require transition and the diversity of potential approaches to transition and given the possibility that the period during which the transition will need to take place may have a short duration.\nSimilarly, our failure to successfully implement transition from LIBOR to alternative rates could result in regulatory scrutiny and actions by our regulators including fines and other supervisory sanctions.\nIt is also possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to the currently anticipated cessation dates. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time for preparing for the transition.\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the associated risks, we have established an enterprise LIBOR transition program, described in the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report. Any failure of this program to appropriately assess and mitigate risk and deliver in a timely manner on operationalizing our ability to transition from LIBOR could magnify the risks previously outlined.\nNew customer privacy initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on PNC, may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data.\nRecently there has been an increase in legislative and regulatory efforts to protect the privacy of consumer data. Significant examples include the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act. These initiatives, among other things, limit how companies can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data. Financial services companies such as PNC necessarily gather, maintain and use a significant amount of customer data. These types of initiatives increase compliance complexity and related costs, result in significant financial penalties for compliance failures, and limit our ability to develop new products or respond to technological changes. Such legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by us, our vendors, or others who gain unauthorized access to our customer data. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar requirements that impose different and potentially inconsistent compliance burdens. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also are changing their behavior as a result of these concerns. PNC and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, and the like as a result of governmental actions or societal responses to climate change. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including their reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities as well as their exposure to the effects of climate change. Among the impacts to PNC could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans, pressure from individuals or groups to cease doing business with certain companies or sectors, or additional regulatory restrictions or costs associated with providing products or services to certain companies or sectors. The Risk Factor headed “We are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation” has further discussion of risks associated with activist pressure. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior, including those resulting from activist pressure.\nRisks Related to the Use of Technology\nThe use of technology is critical to our ability to maintain or enhance the competitiveness of our businesses.\nAs a large financial services company, we handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record and monitor our transactions and those of our customers. Over time, we have seen more customer usage of technological solutions for financial needs as well as higher expectations of customers and regulators regarding effective and safe systems operation. In many cases, the effective use of technology increases\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n23\nefficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers. As a result of these factors, the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Examples include expanded use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, biometric authentication, voice and natural language, and data protection enhancements, as well as increased online and mobile device interaction with customers. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. Change is coming both from traditional banking companies and non-bank financial technology companies offering financial products and services, particularly payment services and lending. Our ability to succeed is dependent on the technologies we employ and offer our customers and the extent to which we at least keep pace with, if not exceed, our competitors’ progress and our customers’ needs and expectations.\nIn response to actual and anticipated customer behavior and expectations, as well as competitive pressures, we have been investing in technology and connectivity. We are seeking to automate functions previously performed manually, facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. This effort has involved the expenditure of considerable amounts of funds and other resources. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner or because we fail to keep pace with our competitors, would likely cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense. Our ability to maintain or enhance our relative technological position is in part dependent on our ability to attract and retain talented employees in these fields, which, due to overall demand, is increasingly difficult.\nOur use of technology is dependent on having the right to use the underlying intellectual property.\nIn some cases, we develop internally the intellectual property embedded in the technology we use. In others, we or our vendors license it from others. Regardless of the source of the intellectual property, if another person or entity were deemed to own intellectual property rights infringed by our activities, we could be responsible for significant damages covering past activities and substantial fees to continue to engage in these types of activities. It also is possible that we could be prevented from using technology important to our business for at least a period of time. In such a circumstance, there may be no alternative technology for us to use or an appropriate alternative technology might be expensive to obtain. Protections offered by those from whom we license technology against these risks may be inadequate to cover fully any losses. Over time, there have been instances where technology used by PNC and other financial institutions has been alleged to have infringed patents held by others, and in some cases we, as well as other financial institutions, have suffered related losses.\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of our information systems and other technology.\nThe need to ensure proper functioning and resiliency of our information systems and other technology has become more important and more challenging, and the costs involved in that effort continue to be high. The risks of operational failures in the use of these systems result from a variety of factors. We are vulnerable to the impact of failures of our systems to operate as needed or intended. Failures leading to materially adverse impacts could include those resulting from human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or overall design or performance issues. In addition, our ability to use our technology effectively could be impacted due to bad weather, disasters, bad actors, terrorism and the like. Such events could affect our systems directly or limit our ability to use our technology due to effects on key underlying infrastructure. In some cases, the risk results from the potential for bad acts on the part of others, discussed in more detail in the Risk Factor headed “We are vulnerable to the risk of third party breaches of data security affecting the functioning of systems or the confidentiality of information, either at PNC or at third parties handling PNC information.”\nWe also rely on information systems maintained by other companies. We use other companies both to provide products and services directly to us and to assist in providing products and services to our customers. Others provide the infrastructure that supports, for example, communications, payment, clearing and settlement systems, or information processing and storage. These companies range from those providing highly sophisticated information processing to those that provide fundamental services, such as electric power and telecommunications. In some cases, these other companies themselves utilize third parties to support their delivery of products and services to us and our customers. Systems maintained by or for these other companies are generally subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our systems and thus their issues could have a negative impact on PNC. We necessarily have less ability to provide oversight over other companies’ information systems.\nA number of our customers choose to use financial applications (apps) that allow them to view banking and other financial account information, often held at different financial institutions, on a single platform, to monitor the performance of their investments, to compare financial and investment products, to make payments or transfer funds, and otherwise to help manage their finances and investments. Financial apps often ask users to provide their secure banking log-in information and credentials (username and password) so the apps can link to users’ accounts at financial institutions. Companies offering these apps frequently use third-party data aggregators – behind-the-scenes technology companies that serve as a data-gathering service provider – to deliver customer financial data that is used by the financial apps. To do this, data aggregators are provided with customers’ log-in information and credentials, which allows the aggregators to access the customers’ online account and “scrape” the customers’ data, often on a daily or even more frequent basis. That same information has the potential to facilitate fraud if it is not properly protected. In fact, the Director of the FinCEN has stated that FinCEN has seen high incidences of fraud, including ACH fraud, credit card fraud, and wire fraud,\n24\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nenabled through the use of synthetic identities and through account takeovers via these platforms. In some cases, cybercriminals appear to be using such data aggregators and integrators to facilitate account takeovers and fraudulent wires. PNC has and may continue to face increased financial exposure due to fraudulent activity associated with the increased use of these apps and data aggregators. Even where PNC does not have responsibility for fraud losses associated with these apps and data aggregators, PNC could suffer increased reputational harm when such losses occur.\nAlthough we regularly update and replace systems that we depend on as our needs evolve and technology improves, we continue to utilize some older systems that may not be as reliable as newer ones. In addition, the implementation of and transition to new or updated systems creates risks related to associated timing and costs, disruptions in functionality for customers and longer term failures to achieve desired improvements.\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our information or communications systems, or the systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to us. This risk is greater if the issue is widespread, extends for a significant period of time, or results in financial losses to our customers. The consequences of failures to operate systems properly can include disruptions to our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan, payment and other systems. Such events could also cause errors in transactions or impair system functionality with customers, vendors or other parties. Possible adverse consequences also include damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business, which could occur even if the negative impact on customers was de minimis. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. This in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement of adversely affected customers. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, information systems issues at other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions, including us. Also, system problems, including those resulting from third party attacks, whether at PNC or at our competitors, would likely broadly increase legislative, regulatory and customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and security of such systems. In that case, we would expect to incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks.\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of third party breaches of data security affecting the functioning of systems or the confidentiality of information, either at PNC or at third parties handling PNC information.\nWe are faced with ongoing, bordering on continual, efforts by others to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. Some of these involve efforts to enter our systems directly by going through or around our security protections. Others involve the use of social engineering schemes to gain access to confidential information from our employees, customers or vendors. Most corporate and commercial transactions are now handled electronically, and our retail customers increasingly use online access and mobile devices to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with us in this manner depends on the transmission and storage of confidential information in electronic form. As a result, efforts by bad actors to engage in various types of cyber attacks pose serious risks to our business and reputation. The same risks are presented by attacks potentially affecting information held by third parties on our behalf or accessed by third parties, including those offering financial apps, on behalf of our customers.\nIn the ordinary course, we maintain and process vast amounts of information about us, our customers and our employees. This information tends to be confidential or proprietary and much of it is highly sensitive. The highly sensitive information includes information sufficient to support identity theft and personal health information, as well as information regarding business plans and financial performance that has not been made public. One way in which bad actors attempt to harm us is by seeking access to some of this confidential or proprietary information, often with the intent of stealing from or defrauding us or our customers. In other cases, they seek to disrupt our ability to conduct our business, including by destroying or impairing our access to information maintained by us.\nOur customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us and may provide their PNC customer information (including passwords) to a third party in connection with obtaining services from the third party, including those offering financial apps. Although we take steps to provide safety and security for our customers’ transactions with us and their customer information to the extent they are utilizing their own devices or providing third parties access to their accounts, our ability to assure such safety and security is necessarily limited.\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses, there is also the risk of data security breaches at those other businesses covering PNC account information. When our customers use PNC issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information often is provided to the business. If the business’s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach, holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. We can be responsible for reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers’ card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts, but to date such losses have not been material to us. In addition, we provide card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach. Over the last few years, several large companies disclosed that they had suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials. To date, our losses and costs related to these types of breaches, including those where some of the accounts affected were with PNC, have not been material. Other similar events in the\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n25\nfuture could be more significant to us. Moreover, to the extent more consumer confidential information becomes available to bad actors through the cumulative effect of data breaches at companies generally, bad actors may find it easier to use such information to gain access to our customer accounts.\nOther cyber attacks are not focused on gaining access to credit card or user credential information, but instead seek access to a range of other types of confidential information, such as internal emails and other forms of customer financial information. Ransomware attacks have sought to deny access to data and possibly shut down systems and devices maintained by target companies. In a ransomware attack, system data is encrypted or access is otherwise denied, accompanied by a demand for ransom to restore access to the data. To date, our losses and costs related to these types of attacks have not been material, but ransomware attacks have increased in recent years and there is no guarantee that future attacks will not be successful.\nA number of companies have fallen victim to BEC scams in recent years. BEC scams involve using social engineering to cause employees to wire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken belief that the requests were made by a company executive or established vendor. While we have not experienced material losses from BEC scams to date, some of our commercial customers have been victimized. Attacks on our customers may put these relationships at risk, particularly if customers’ ability to continue operations is impaired due to the losses suffered.\nOther attacks in recent years have included DDoS attacks, in which individuals or organizations flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. We (as well as other financial services companies) have been subject to such attacks.\nIn addition to threats from external sources, insider threats represent a significant risk to us. Insiders, including those having legitimate access to our systems and the information contained in them, have the easiest opportunity to make inappropriate use of the systems and information. Addressing that risk requires understanding not only how to protect us from unauthorized use and disclosure of data, but also how to engage behavioral analytics and other tools to identify potential internal threats before any damage is done.\nTo date, none of these types of attacks have had a material impact on us. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely block efforts by bad actors to harm us. And our efforts to prevent significant harm from attacks may be insufficient. While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. As a result, we could suffer material financial and reputational losses in the future from any of these or other types of attacks or the public perception that such an attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct. Attacks on others, some of which have led to serious adverse consequences, demonstrate the risks posed by new and evolving types of cyber attacks. Our ability to protect confidential or proprietary information is even more limited with respect to information held by third parties. We may suffer reputational damage or legal liability for unauthorized access to customer information held by third parties, even if we were in fact not responsible for preventing such access and had no reasonable way of preventing it.\nWe need effective programs to limit the risk of failures or breaches occurring in our information systems and to mitigate the impact when they do.\nWe have policies, procedures and systems (including cyber security and business continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems. In recent years, we have devoted significant resources towards improving the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats and expect to continue to do so in the future. We design our business continuity and other information and technology risk management programs to manage our capabilities to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of business activities affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. We cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our policies, procedures and systems to protect us in any particular future situation, nor the effectiveness of our oversight of risk at third parties. Our ability to implement policies, procedures and systems designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems with respect to third party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is necessarily limited. Should an adverse event affecting another company’s systems occur, we may not have financial protection from the other company sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect us from the consequences.\nMethods used by others to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication). A new method of attack often is not recognized until launched against a target. Attacks in some cases appear to be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities and often originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures to address these methods in advance of attacks.\nEven with our proactive and defensive measures in place, adverse events are likely to occur and there remains the risk that one or more such events would be material to PNC. Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business continuity planning, our ability to understand threats to us from a holistic perspective, and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that occurs, with novel or unusual events posing a greater risk. It is also the case that an adverse event can go undetected for a period of time, with the adverse consequences likely greater the longer it takes to discover the\n26\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nproblem. In many cases, it also depends on the preparedness and responses of national or regional governments, including emergency responders, or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal.\nRisks Related to the Business of Banking\nOur business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial services business. It results from, among other things, extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and securities and the importance of lending activity to our overall business. We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties, by diversifying our loan portfolio and by investing primarily in high quality securities.\nA borrower’s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by many factors. Individual borrowers can be affected, for example, by declines in income, job losses, health issues or family issues. Commercial borrowers can be affected, for example, by poor business performance, changes in customer behavior or catastrophic losses. Weakness in the economy or in financial markets would typically adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. We are exposed to increased credit risk if we fail to evaluate properly at origination the likely ability of a borrower to repay a loan. Properly estimating the current and potential value of any collateral pledged to support the loan also is critical to effectively managing credit risk. A failure to identify declining creditworthiness of a borrower or declining collateral value at a time when remedial actions could reduce our exposure also increases credit risk. Any decrease in our borrowers’ ability to repay loans would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. Managing credit risk effectively also relies on forecasts of future overall economic conditions, which are inherently imperfect.\nIn addition to credit risk associated with our lending activities, we have credit risk arising from many other types of business relationships. Routine transactions give us credit exposure to brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, other institutional clients, as well as vendors and other non-financial entities.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often have heightened credit exposure to a particular industry, region or financial market. As an example, loans secured by commercial and residential real estate typically represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio. They also represent a portion of the assets underlying our investment securities. Although there are limitations on the extent of total exposure to an individual or business borrower, we may have outsized exposure to a particular borrower experiencing financial distress. Events adversely affecting specific customers or counterparties, industries, regions or financial markets, including a decline in their creditworthiness or a worsening overall risk profile, could materially and adversely affect us. Declining economic conditions also may impact commercial borrowers more than consumer borrowers, or vice versa. Thus, the concentration and mix of our loan portfolio may affect the severity of the impact of a recession on us.\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon, including as a result of legal or regulatory changes, or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.\nWe reserve for credit losses on our loan and lease portfolio through our ACL estimated under CECL. Under CECL, the ACL reflects expected lifetime losses, which could lead to volatility in the allowance and the provision for credit losses as economic forecasts, actual credit performance and other factors used in the loss estimating process change. We also have reserves for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Changes are reflected in net income through provision for credit losses. An increase in credit risk would likely lead to an increase in provision for credit losses with a resulting reduction in our net income and would increase our allowance. An improvement of economic conditions or our economic outlook, particularly following a period of poor economic conditions, has and could continue to result in a recapture of provision for credit losses for a period of time with a resulting increase in our net income and decrease in our allowance that is not likely to be sustained.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted both commercial borrowers and consumers. In addition, the declines in GDP and increases in unemployment associated with the pandemic, and responsive measures to manage it, have significantly impacted the economic and qualitative factors used for purposes of our estimation of credit losses under CECL. For a discussion of the increased credit risk arising from the pandemic and its impact to our estimation of credit losses, see the Risk Factor headed “The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.”\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n27\nOur business and financial performance are impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:\n•\nChanges in interest rates or interest rate spreads affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities, which impacts our overall net interest income and margin as well as our profitability.\n•\nSuch changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, increase our credit losses on those assets.\n•\nSuch changes can decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.\n•\nSuch changes affect our hedging of various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in helping to manage such risks.\n•\nMovements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.\n•\nIncreases in interest rates likely lower the price we would receive on fixed-rate customer obligations if we were to sell them.\nWe may also experience spread compression by offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits as a result of increased competition.\nThe rates on some interest-bearing instruments adjust promptly in accordance with changes in market rates, while others adjust only periodically or are fixed throughout a defined term. As a result, the impact of changes in interest rates can be either increased or diluted due to differences in the relative variability of the rates paid on our liabilities in relation to the rates received on our assets. The extent to which we have elected to hedge interest rate risk through interest rate swaps also affects the impact of rate changes. We attempt to manage the balance sheet to increase our benefit or reduce negative impacts from future movements in interest rates, but failures to anticipate actual movements may have the opposite result.\nWhile in general higher interest rates enhance our ability to grow our net interest income, there are risks associated with a rising interest rate environment. As a general matter, increasing rates tend to decrease the value of fixed-rate financial instruments held on our balance sheet, as discussed in the Risk Factor headed “Our business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.” Also, customers may be less willing overall to borrow at higher rates. Higher interest rates may indirectly affect the value of asset classes such as real estate typically financed through secured loans, with a resulting negative effect on collateral securing such loans. As another example, there may be increased competitive pressures as rates on deposit products rise. The benefits of higher interest rates are best achieved if we can increase the rates on loans and other assets faster than the rates on deposits and other liabilities increase. We may not be able to achieve this result in a rising rate environment.\nOn the other hand, lower interest rates tend to have a negative impact on our net interest margin, and, unless offset by higher earning assets, on our net interest income. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which interest rates drop below zero either broadly or for some types of instruments, could reduce our net interest margin and net interest income due to a likely decline in the interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank. In addition, our systems may not be able to handle adequately a negative interest rate environment and not all variable rate instruments are designed for such a circumstance. The current very low interest rate environment increases the potential for negative interest rates to occur.\nWe discuss the impact of governmental monetary policy on interest rates in the Risk Factors headed “The policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, which are important to our business and financial performance” and “The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.”\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.\nAs a financial institution, a substantial majority of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. Examples include loans, securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings. Such assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in question. Credit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of borrowers or other counterparties and also due to changes in market interest rates.\nChanges in loan prepayment speeds, which often occur when interest rates change, impact the value of our mortgage servicing rights, possibly adversely. Also, the underlying value of assets under lease or securing an obligation generally decreases due to increases in supply or decreases in demand for the asset or deterioration in the condition of the asset. This could negatively impact the ability to collect fully on the secured obligation.\n28\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nIn many cases, we mark our assets and liabilities to market and recognize such changes either through net income or OCI. Thus, gains or losses on these assets and liabilities can have a direct impact on our results of operations, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. We may need to record losses in the value of financial assets even where our expectation of realizing the face value of the underlying instrument has not changed. Other assets and liabilities are not marked to market. As a result, our balance sheet does not precisely represent the fair market value of our financial assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, asset management revenue is earned primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets being managed and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related Noninterest income.\nFor a discussion of the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to the values of financial assets, see the Risk Factor headed “The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.”\nRisks Related to Estimates and Assumptions\nOur asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets are highly subjective. Inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, it would be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically traded in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In addition, we have assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The valuation of any asset or liability substantially based on unobservable inputs is necessarily less reliable than those based on active trading markets. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements. Our ability to hedge exposure is in part dependent on our ability to value the related assets or liabilities.\nThe determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due to the subjective nature of this area, the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements may not accurately reflect the actual level of risk and the amount of future losses.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate many financial values. We use models throughout much of our business, relying on them for much of our decision making. Examples of areas we use models include determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels. We also use models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. In particular, we depend significantly on complex models for credit loss accounting under CECL, many of which have only been in use for a relatively short period of time.\nModels generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions, relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macro-economic conditions, in order to generate the output. Poorly designed or implemented models, including in the choice of relevant historical data or future-looking assumptions, present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, would likely be affected adversely if they perceive that the quality of the relevant models used is insufficient.\nRisks Related to Our Need for Customers\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services.\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with declines in customer demand for our products and services. As a result of the nature of those products and services, we are particularly at risk for losses of economic confidence or customer trust in us. For a\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n29\ndiscussion of the risks related to declines in demand for our products and services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, see the Risk Factor headed “The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.”\nEconomic and market developments may affect consumer and business confidence levels. If customers lose confidence due to concerns regarding the economy, the demand for our products and services could suffer. We may also fail to attract or retain customers if we are unable to develop and market products and services that meet evolving customer needs or demands or if we are unable to deliver them effectively and securely to our customers. This is particularly true to the extent that our competitors are better able to do so.\nIf we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans and other financial products and services could decrease and we could experience adverse changes in payment patterns. We could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and noninterest income from a decline in product sales, investments and other transactions.\nOur customers could remove money from checking, savings or other types of deposit accounts with us in favor of other banks or other types of investment products. Deposits are a low cost source of funds for us. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income.\nOur ability to attract and retain customer deposits is impacted by the levels of interest rates, as customers balance the benefits of bank accounts such as deposit insurance and some of the convenience associated with more traditional banking products against the possibility of higher yields from other investments. In general, if the spread between the rates we offer and those offered by alternatives to bank accounts widens, customers are often willing to forego the benefits of bank accounts for higher returns elsewhere. In such circumstances, we would need either to increase rates to levels that are seen as competitive or lose customers, in either case with a negative impact to net interest income. Loss of customers could also harm noninterest income by decreasing fee-bearing transaction volume. In addition, when rates are higher, customers tend to shift deposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to interest-bearing ones, thereby negatively impacting net interest income.\nOur customers increasingly use third party financial applications that are expected to interface with their PNC accounts. This use leads to the risk that issues with respect to the effective functioning of that interface, regardless of cause, could result in a loss of customers as they seek banking relationships that work better with these other applications.\nNews or other publicity that harms our reputation, or harms the reputation of our industry generally, also could cause a loss of customers or a reduction in the extent to which customers do business with us. This is described further in the Risk Factor headed “We are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.”\nIn our asset management business, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets that we manage. Poor investment advice or performance could hurt revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have an adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.\nWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract and retain customers and employees, and to grow our business is dependent on maintaining our reputation and having the trust of our customers and employees. Many types of developments, if publicized, can negatively impact a company’s reputation with adverse consequences to its business.\nFinancial services companies are highly vulnerable to reputational damage when they are found to have harmed customers, particularly retail customers, through conduct that is seen as illegal, unfair, deceptive, abusive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful. There also may be reputational damage from human error or systems failures viewed as having harmed customers but not involving misconduct, including negative perceptions regarding our ability to maintain the security of our technology systems and protect client data. The reputational impact is likely greater to the extent that the bad conduct, error or failure are pervasive, long-standing or affect a significant number of customers, particularly retail consumers. The negative impact of such reputational damage on our business may be disproportionate to the actual harm caused to customers. It may be severe even if we fully remediate any harm suffered by our customers. Furthermore, because we conduct most of our businesses under the “PNC” brand, negative public opinion about one business could also affect our other businesses. In addition, we could suffer reputational harm and a loss of customer trust as a result of conduct of others in the industry even where we have not engaged in the conduct. We use third parties to help in many aspects of our business, with the risk that their conduct can affect our reputation regardless of the degree to which we are responsible for it.\n30\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nTo an increasing extent, financial services companies, including PNC, are facing criticism from social and environmental activists, with accompanying reputational risk. Activists target companies in our industry, including PNC, for engaging in business with specific customers or with customers in particular industries, where the customers’ activities, even if legal, are perceived as having harmful impacts on matters such as environment, consumer health and safety, or society at large. In addition, other activists target companies in our industry, including PNC, seeking increased transparency and action with respect to diversity and inclusion (including pay equity) and political activities. Activist criticism has come in many forms, including protests at PNC facilities. PNC, together with many other financial services companies, have in recent years been criticized for financing companies engaged in, for example, extraction and distribution of fossil fuels, manufacture of nuclear and other weapons (including personal firearms), private prisons, and border control activities. Many of these issues are divisive without broad agreement as to the appropriate steps a company such as PNC should take and often with strong feelings on both sides. As a result, however we respond to such criticism, we expose ourselves to the risks that current or potential customers decline to do business with us or current or potential employees refuse to work for us. This can be true regardless of whether we are perceived by some as not having done enough to address activist concerns or by others as having inappropriately yielded to activist pressures. Activist pressure can also be a factor in decisions as to which business opportunities and customers we pursue, potentially resulting in foregone profit opportunities. The OCC has requested comment on a proposed rule that would prohibit large national banks, such as PNC Bank, from declining to provide credit or other products or services to customers engaged in lawful activities except for documented, pre-approved risk-related reasons. The rule, if adopted, could cause some customers to switch their business to other banks that are not subject to these restrictions or have other negative consequences on PNC’s businesses, operations and risk management activities.\nThe speed with which information now moves through social media and non-mainstream news sources on the internet means that negative information about PNC can rapidly have a broadly adverse impact on our reputation. This is true whether or not the information is accurate. Once information has gone viral, it can be hard to counter it effectively, either by correcting inaccuracies or communicating remedial steps taken for actual issues. The potential impact of negative information going viral means that material reputational harm can result from a single discrete or isolated incident.\nWe are also subject to the risk of reputational harm resulting from conduct of persons identified as our employees but acting outside of the scope of their employment, including through their activities on personal social media.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as the labor markets where we compete for talented employees.\nWe are subject to intense competition both from other financial institutions and from non-bank entities, including financial technology companies (often referred to as FinTech). In many cases, non-bank entities can engage in many activities similar to ours without being subject to the same types of regulation, supervision and restrictions as are applicable to banks. The competition we face is described in Item 1 of this Report under “Competition.”\nConsolidation in our industry, including among smaller banks combining to form more competitive larger ones and between banks and non-bank entities, could result in PNC facing more intense competition, particularly in impacted regions or with respect to particular products.\nAnother increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees across many of our businesses and support areas. This factor presents greater risk when we are expanding into new markets, developing new product lines, or significantly enhancing staffing in certain areas, particularly technology. This competition leads to increased expenses in affected business areas. In addition, the transition to increased work-from-home, which is likely to survive the COVID-19 pandemic for many companies, may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. Limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions can compensate their officers and employees, including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of Dodd-Frank, may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions, including PNC, to compete with unregulated companies for talent.\nA failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, competitive pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin, negatively impacting our net interest income.\nRisks Related to Other Operational Issues\nWe depend on the effectiveness and integrity of employees, and the systems and controls for which they are responsible, to manage operational risks.\nWe are a large company that offers a wide variety of products and services to a broad and diverse group of customers. We rely on our employees to design, manage, and operate our systems and controls to assure that we properly enter into, record and manage\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n31\nprocesses, transactions and other relationships with customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business. In some cases, we rely on employees of third parties to perform these tasks. We also depend on employees and the systems and controls for which they are responsible to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in our relationships and activities. These concerns are increased when we change processes or procedures, introduce new products or services, or implement new technologies, as we may fail to adequately identify or manage operational risks resulting from such changes.\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on employees, whether ours or those of third parties, to perform these tasks and manage resulting risks, we are thus subject to human vulnerabilities. These range from innocent human error to misconduct or malfeasance, potentially leading to operational breakdowns or other failures. Our controls may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from human involvement in our business, including risks associated with the design, operation and monitoring of automated systems. We may also fail to adequately develop a culture of risk management among our employees.\nErrors by our employees or others responsible for systems and controls on which we depend and any resulting failures of those systems and controls could result in significant harm to PNC. This could include customer remediation costs, regulatory fines or penalties, litigation or enforcement actions, or limitations on our business activities. We could also suffer damage to our reputation, as described under “We are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.”\nWe use automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation tools to help reduce some risks of human error. Nonetheless, we continue to rely on many manual processes to conduct our business and manage our risks. In addition, use of automation tools does not eliminate the need for effective design and monitoring of their operation to make sure they operate as intended. Enhanced use of automation may present its own risks. These tools are dependent on the quality of the data used by the tool to learn and enhance the process for which it is responsible. Not only bad or missing data but also anomalous data can adversely affect the functioning of such tools. It is possible that humans in some cases are better able than highly automated tools to identify that anomalous data is being used or that results are themselves anomalous.\nWe rely on third party vendors, service providers and other counterparties to help support many aspects of our business. When we do so, our direct control of activities related to our business is reduced, which could introduce risk.\nOur use of third parties to support our business needs typically means that we do not directly control the activities we are having them perform. Risks can arise through greater complexity and inadequate performance by the third party, specifically where that performance could affect us or our customers. Many of the kinds of risks presented by activities performed by third parties are described elsewhere in these Risk Factors. For example, we use outside companies to assist us in processing some confidential customer or employee information. In such a case, a cyber attack on such a company may result in access to our customers’ or employees’ information. We are also vulnerable, including to regulatory penalties, where an outside company fails to comply with legal requirements relevant to its work on our behalf. We may in any such circumstance suffer financial losses, legal consequences and injury to our reputation. Even if the other company makes us whole for financial losses, which is not necessarily the case, it is unlikely that it would be able to restore any injury to our reputation. As a result, the use of third parties to assist in our business activities heightens the risks to us inherent in those activities.\nOther Key Risks\nWe are at risk for the impact of adverse results in legal proceedings.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities. In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued often do not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate future losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\n32\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services businesses from time to time. Sometimes these are businesses with technologies or other assets valuable to us even if they do not themselves provide financial services to customers. These acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nAcquisitions of other companies or of financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to us in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired. These risks and uncertainties are found in the pending acquisition of BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, and its integration into PNC following closing.\nAcquisitions may be substantially more expensive or take longer to complete than anticipated. This risk includes unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired business. Anticipated benefits (such as cost savings from synergies or strategic gains from being able to offer enhanced product sets) may take longer or require greater resources to achieve. In some cases, it may prove impossible to realize them in their entirety. The success of an acquisition generally is at least partially dependent on our ability to retain and expand upon the acquired company’s customer base. It is also frequently subject to risks related to human capital, including, if being retained, the quality of leadership of the acquired company.\nSpecific factors that can affect the ultimate results from acquisitions include, depending on the nature of the business acquired, the following:\n•\nIf the acquisition includes loan portfolios, the extent of actual credit losses and the required allowance for credit losses following completion of the acquisition.\n•\nIf a significant aspect of the value of an acquired business is intellectual property, the extent to which the intellectual property may be protected and commercialized by PNC following the acquisition.\n•\nIf the acquisition involves entering into new businesses or geographic or other markets, potential limitations on our ability to take advantage of these opportunities as a result of our inexperience with respect to them.\n•\nThe results of litigation and governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of the acquisition or be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise. It is often hard to predict the results of such legal proceedings. It may also be hard to anticipate what legal proceedings may be started following an acquisition based on the prior activities of the acquired company (and its predecessors).\n•\nIf the acquired company depends on models for, among other things, capital planning and credit loss accounting, we may have to rely on the acquired company’s models for a period of time post-closing prior to integrating the acquired company’s data into PNC’s models. The acquired company’s models may be designed or implemented in a manner different than the models used by PNC. As a result, incorporation of the acquired company’s data into our models could materially impact our results of operations or financial position to the extent that our estimates based on the acquired company’s models prove to be inaccurate.\n•\nThe acquired company may operate under enterprise risk management systems, policies and procedures that are different and less mature than those of PNC, and we may need to rely on the acquired company’s enterprise risk management systems policies and procedures for a period of time after acquisition, which might limit PNC’s ability to identify, monitor, manage and report risks for a period of time.\nOur ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the business we are acquiring. We may not have access to all of the information that would be desirable. Our pre-acquisition review of the business also impacts our ability to prepare for and execute on the integration of an acquired business. An acquired company’s financial and business information and data may not be maintained at the level of detail or comprehensiveness to meet all of our post-acquisition needs.\nProspective acquisition targets are also subject to their own risks that we cannot manage or control prior to closing and that may impact their business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected after closing to the extent that any such risks result in non-indemnified losses for which we are responsible.\nCompleting attractive acquisition opportunities generally requires various governmental and regulatory approvals and consents prior to closing. These authorities have broad discretion, and regulatory approvals could be delayed, restrictively conditioned or denied, including due to regulatory issues we (or the target company) have, or may have, under any of the numerous governmental regulations to which we (or they) are subject. Moreover, as a condition to approval, governmental authorities may impose requirements, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company, which could limit the benefits of the acquisition or result in delay or the failure to close the acquisition. Significant acquisitions by large banks also often attract public scrutiny, which may result in negative publicity that adversely affects our reputation. Our ability to make large acquisitions may be negatively impacted as well by changes in leadership at the regulatory agencies responsible for reviewing or approving the transaction, changes in regulatory rules or standards or the application of those rules or standards, or future regulatory initiatives designed to limit systemic risk and the potential for a financial institution to become “too big to fail.”\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n33\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities, by international hostilities or by domestic civil unrest.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (whether caused naturally or by human conduct), pandemics, terrorist activities, international hostilities and domestic civil unrest can be predicted. However, these occurrences could adversely impact us, for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course. Also, their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties could result in indirect adverse effects on us. Other indirect adverse consequences from disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, international hostilities or domestic civil unrest could result from impacts to the financial markets, the economy in general or in any particular region, or key parts of the infrastructure (such as the power grid) on which we and our customers rely. These types of indirect effects, whether specific to our counterparties or more generally applicable, could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. They could also cause a reduction in demand for lending or other services that we provide. To the extent that climate change increases the frequency or severity of adverse weather conditions, the impact from these types of natural disasters on us or our customers would be worse. The specific risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed in the Risk Factor headed “The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect, possibly materially, on our overall business and financial performance.”\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning. This includes our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that might occur. The adverse impact of disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, international hostilities or domestic civil unrest also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, many of which we depend on but have limited or no control over."

    "text": "Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is traded under the symbol “PNC.” At the close of business on February 12, 2021, there were 49,295 common shareholders of record.\nHolders of PNC common stock are entitled to receive dividends when declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for this purpose. Our Board of Directors may not pay or set apart dividends on the common stock until dividends for all past dividend periods on any series of outstanding preferred stock and certain outstanding capital securities issued by the parent company have been paid or declared and set apart for payment. The Board of Directors presently intends to continue the policy of paying quarterly cash dividends. The amount of any future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, our financial condition and operating results, and other factors, including contractual restrictions and applicable government regulations and policies (such as those relating to the ability of bank and non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company and regulatory capital limitations). PNC’s ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders is subject to PNC’s compliance with its SCB, which is determined at least annually through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process as described in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report. The Federal Reserve also has imposed additional limitations on capital distributions through the first quarter of 2021 by CCAR participating bank holding companies (including PNC) and may extend these limitations, potentially in modified form. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve's effort to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic and we continued the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020, with the exception of employee benefit-related purchases in the third quarter. In 2021, our plan is to refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases, during the period leading up to our pending BBVA transaction close date.\nFor further information concerning dividend restrictions and other factors that could limit our ability to pay dividends, as well as restrictions on loans, dividends or advances from bank subsidiaries to the parent company, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1, Item 1A Risk Factors, the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7, and Note 10 Borrowed Funds, Note 12 Equity and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, which we include here by reference.\n36\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nWe include here by reference the information regarding our compensation plans under which PNC equity securities are authorized for issuance as of December 31, 2020 in the table (with introductory paragraph and notes) in Item 12 of this Report.\nOur stock transfer agent and registrar is:\nComputershare\n462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600\nLouisville, KY 40202\n800-982-7652\nwww.computershare.com/pnc\nRegistered shareholders may contact Computershare regarding dividends and other shareholder services.\nWe include here by reference the information that appears under the Common Stock Performance Graph caption at the end of this Item 5.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nEquity Security Repurchases\nDetails of our repurchases of PNC common stock during the fourth quarter of 2020 are included in the following table:\n(a)\nIncludes PNC common stock purchased in connection with our various employee benefit plans generally related to forfeitures of unvested restricted stock awards and shares used to cover employee payroll tax withholding requirements. Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans and Note 18 Stock Based Compensation Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report include additional information regarding our employee benefit and equity compensation plans that use PNC common stock.\n(b)\nOn April 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the establishment of a new stock repurchase program authorization in the amount of 100 million shares of PNC common stock, effective July 1, 2019.  Under this authorization, repurchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions, with the timing and exact amount of common stock repurchases depending on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, and contractual and regulatory limitations, including the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process. In June 2019, we announced share repurchase programs of up to $4.3 billion for the four quarter period beginning with the third quarter of 2019, in accordance with PNC’s 2019 capital plan.  In January 2020, we announced an increase to these programs to repurchase up to an additional $1.0 billion in common shares through the end of the second quarter of 2020. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s effort to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic. We continued the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020, with the exception of employee benefit-related purchases in the third quarter, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve’s special capital distribution restrictions. Under these programs we repurchased 11.0 million shares in 2020 and 25.9 million shares in 2019. A maximum amount of 75.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the new stock program authorization at December 31, 2020. In 2021, our plan is to refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases, during the period leading up to our pending BBVA transaction close date.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n37\nCommon Stock Performance Graph\nThis graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return (\ni.e.\n, price change plus reinvestment of dividends) on our common stock during the five-year period ended December 31, 2020, as compared with: (1) a selected peer group as set forth below and referred to as the “Peer Group;” (2) an overall stock market index, the S&P 500 Index; and (3) a published industry index, the S&P 500 Banks. The yearly points marked on the horizontal axis of the graph correspond to December 31 of each year. The stock performance graph assumes that $100 was invested on January 1, 2016 for the five-year period and that dividends were reinvested. The table below the graph shows the resultant compound annual growth rate for the performance period.\nThe Peer Group for the preceding chart and table above consists of the following companies: Bank of America Corporation; Capital One Financial Corporation; Citizens Financial Group, Inc.; Fifth Third Bancorp; JPMorgan Chase & Co.; KeyCorp; M&T Bank Corporation; Regions Financial Corporation; The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.; Truist Financial Corporation; U.S. Bancorp; and Wells Fargo & Company. For Truist Financial Corporation, the preceding chart and table reflects historical BB&T Corporation data from December 2015 to December 2018. Historical data for SunTrust Banks, Inc. is not included as a part of Truist Financial Corporation in the preceding chart and table. This Peer Group was approved for 2020 by the Board of Directors’ Personnel and Compensation Committee, and the Committee has approved the same peer group for 2021.\nEach yearly point for the Peer Group is determined by calculating the cumulative total shareholder return for each company in the Peer Group from December 31, 2015 to December 31 of that year, or the last business day of that year (End of Month Dividend Reinvestment Assumed) and then using the median of these returns as the yearly plot point.\nIn accordance with the rules of the SEC, this section, captioned “Common Stock Performance Graph,” is not incorporated by reference into any of our future filings made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933.

For more detail, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business, the Capital Highlights portion of this Executive Summary and the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 7.\nKey Factors Affecting Financial Performance\nWe face a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current business and economic conditions, political and regulatory environment and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail elsewhere in this Report.\nOur success will depend upon, among other things, the following factors that we manage or control:\n•\nEffectively managing capital and liquidity including:\n•\nContinuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a low-cost stable funding source,\n•\nPrudent liquidity and capital management to meet evolving regulatory capital, capital planning, stress testing and liquidity standards, and\n•\nActions we take within the capital and other financial markets.\n•\nExecution of our strategic priorities,\n•\nManagement of credit risk in our portfolio,\n•\nOur ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment,\n•\nThe impact of legal and regulatory-related contingencies,\n•\nThe appropriateness of reserves needed for critical accounting estimates and related contingencies, and\n•\nThe closing of the pending BBVA acquisition and integration of its business into PNC after closing.\nOur financial performance is also substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following:\n•\nGlobal and domestic economic conditions, including the length and extent of the economic impacts of the pandemic,\n•\nThe actions by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates,\n•\nThe level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve,\n•\nThe functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, U.S. and global financial markets, including capital markets,\n•\nThe impact of tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n41\n•\nChanges in the competitive and regulatory landscape,\n•\nThe impact of the results of the recent U.S. elections on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, and the response to and management of the pandemic,\n•\nThe impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations,\n•\nThe ability of customers, counterparties and issuers to perform in accordance with contractual terms, and the resulting impact on our asset quality,\n•\nLoan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and\n•\nThe impact on customers and changes in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or regulatory or legislative initiatives.\nFor additional information on the risks we face, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Item 7 and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report.\nSecond Quarter Sale of Equity Investment in BlackRock, Inc.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, PNC divested its entire 22.4% equity investment in BlackRock. Net proceeds from the sale were $14.2 billion. The after-tax gain on the sale of $4.3 billion, and donation expense and BlackRock’s historical results for all periods presented, are reported as discontinued operations. For additional details on the divestiture of our equity investment in BlackRock, see Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nPending Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc.\nOn November 16, 2020 PNC announced a definitive agreement to acquire BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary BBVA USA, from the Spanish financial group BBVA, S.A for a fixed purchase price of $11.6 billion in cash. BBVA USA operates over 600 branches in Texas, Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2021 and add approximately $102 billion in total assets, $86 billion of deposits and $66 billion of loans, creating the fifth largest bank by assets and a PNC presence in 29 of the 30 largest markets in the U.S. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for details on the pending acquisition.\nIncome Statement Highlights\nNet income from continuing operations for 2020 was $3.0 billion, or $6.36 per diluted common share, a decrease of 35% compared to net income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or $9.57 per diluted common share, for 2019.\n•\nTotal revenue increased $62 million to $16.9 billion.\n•\nNet interest income decreased $19 million to $9.9 billion.\n•\nNet interest margin decreased to 2.53% for 2020 compared to 2.89% for 2019.\n•\nNoninterest income increased $81 million, or 1%, to $7.0 billion.\n•\nProvision for credit losses of $3.2 billion in 2020, calculated under the CECL accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020, increased $2.4 billion compared to $0.8 billion for 2019, reflecting changes due to the adoption of CECL, together with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.\n•\nNoninterest expense decreased $277 million, or 3%, to $10.3 billion.\n•\nWe generated positive operating leverage in 2020 of 3%.\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section of this Item 7.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nOur balance sheet was strong and well positioned at December 31, 2020 and 2019. In comparison to December 31, 2019:\n•\nTotal assets increased $56.4 billion, or 14%, to $466.7 billion.\n•\nTotal loans increased $2.1 billion, or 1%, to $241.9 billion.\n•\nTotal commercial loans grew $6.6 billion, or 4%, to $167.2 billion.\n•\nTotal consumer loans decreased $4.5 billion, or 6%, to $74.7 billion.\n•\nInvestment securities increased $2.0 billion, or 2%, to $88.8 billion.\n•\nInterest earning deposits with banks, primarily with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $61.8 billion to $85.2 billion due to higher liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.\n•\nTotal deposits increased $76.8 billion, or 27%, to $365.3 billion, due to growth in commercial deposits reflecting pandemic-related accumulation of liquidity by customers and higher consumer deposits driven by government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending.\n•\nBorrowed funds of $37.2 billion decreased $23.1 billion, or 38%, reflecting use of liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.\n42\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nFor additional detail, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Item 7.\nCredit Quality Highlights\nCredit quality metrics in 2020 reflected a challenging economic environment.\n•\nAt December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019:\n•\nNonperforming assets of $2.3 billion increased $585 million, or 33%, primarily due to the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic.\n•\nOverall loan delinquencies of $1.4 billion decreased $141 million, or 9%, reflecting CARES Act and other forbearance and extension treatments.\n•\nNet charge-offs of $832 million, or 0.33% of average loans, in 2020 increased 30% compared to net charge-offs of $642 million, or 0.27% of average loans, for 2019. Commercial loan net charge-offs increased $175 million, primarily in industries adversely impacted by the pandemic, and consumer loan net charge-offs increased $15 million compared to 2019.\n•\nThe ACL related to loans increased to $5.9 billion, or 2.46% of total loans, at December 31, 2020, calculated under the CECL accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020, compared to $3.1 billion, or 1.28% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. The increase was due to the transition impact from the adoption of the CECL standard along with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.\nFor additional detail, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7.\nCapital Highlights\nWe maintained a strong capital position during 2020.\n•\nThe Basel III CET1 capital ratio was 12.2% at December 31, 2020 compared with 9.5% at December 31, 2019.\n•\nThe December 31, 2020 ratio reflects higher capital due in part to the gain from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock and changes under the Tailoring Rules, effective January 1, 2020 for PNC, partially offset by the impact of the CECL accounting standard.\n•\nAdditionally, capital benefited from our election of a five-year transition period for CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is defined as the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date co\nmpared to CECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, then phased-out over the following three years.\n•\nCommon shareholder’s equity increased 11% to $50.5 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $45.3 billion at December 31, 2019.\n•\nOn January 5, 2021, the PNC board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share payable on February 5, 2021.\n•\nPNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s effort to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic, and continued the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve’s special capital distribution restrictions. We repurchased $99 million of common shares in the third quarter to offset the effects of employee benefit plan-related issuances in 2020 as permitted by guidance from the Federal Reserve. In 2021, our plan is to refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases, during the period leading up to our pending BBVA transaction close date.\nPNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a stress capital buffer established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. The Federal Reserve also has imposed additional limitations on capital distributions through the first quarter of 2021 by CCAR-participating bank holding companies and may extend these limitations, potentially in modified form. See additional discussion of the CCAR process in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 for more detail on our 2020 capital and liquidity actions as well as our capital ratios.\nBusiness Outlook\nStatements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies.\nThese statements are based on our view that:\n•\nThe U.S. economy is in an economic recovery, following a very severe but very short economic contraction in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures to contain it.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n43\n•\nDespite the improvement in the economy since the spring of 2020, economic activity remains far below its prepandemic level and unemployment remains elevated.\n•\nGrowth will be much weaker in early 2021 because of record COVID-19 cases and continued government restrictions of economic activity. Growth should then pick up in the spring of 2021 as vaccines are more widely available and the federal government provides aid to households and small and medium-sized businesses. PNC does not expect real GDP to return to its pre-pandemic level until late 2021, and does not expect employment to return to its pre-pandemic level until at least 2023.\n•\nPNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds rate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25% through at least mid-2024.\nSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Item 7 and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Report for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nFor information on financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020, see the Selected Quarterly Financial Data section in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of Item 8 of this Report.\nFor the PNC standalone full year 2021, excluding one-time costs related to the BBVA transaction, compared to full year 2020 where appropriate, we expect:\n•\nAverage loan growth to be down in the low-single digits range, and spot loan growth to be up in the low single-digits range, on a percentage basis,\n•\nRevenue growth to be stable, which includes net interest income down modestly,\n•\nNoninterest expense to remain stable, and\n•\nThe effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.\nAssuming a mid-2021 close date and excluding one-time integration costs, we expect the pending BBVA acquisition to be approximately $600 million accretive to PNC’s 2021 pre-provision net revenue.\nFor the first quarter of 2021, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 where appropriate, we expect:\n•\nAverage loans to be stable to down modestly, with PPP loans to be up approximately $2 billion,\n•\nNet interest income to decline approximately 1%, which includes the impact of two fewer days in the quarter,\n◦\nExcluding the impact of PPP, net interest income to decline approximately 3%.\n•\nNoninterest income to decline mid-single digits, on a percentage basis, with other noninterest income to be between $275 million and $325 million,\n•\nNoninterest expense to be down in the mid-single digit range, on a percentage basis, and\n•\nNet loan charge-offs to be between $200 million and $250 million.\nC\nONSOLIDATED\nI\nNCOME\nS\nTATEMENT\nR\nEVIEW\nOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Item 8 of this Report. For the comparison of 2019 over 2018, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nNet income from continuing operations for 2020 was $3.0 billion, or $6.36 per diluted common share, a decrease of $1.6 billion compared with net income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion, or $9.57 per diluted common share, for 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $2.4 billion increase in the provision for credit losses reflecting changes due to the adoption of CECL, together with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.\n44\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nNet Interest Income\nTable 1: Summarized Average Balances and Net Interest Income (a)\n(a)\nInterest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis and Analysis Of Year-To-Year Changes In Net Interest Income in Item 8 of this Report.\nNet interest income decreased $19 million in 2020 compared with 2019. The decrease was driven by lower yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower rates on deposits, higher interest earning asset balances, and lower borrowing rates and balances. Net interest margin decreased 36 basis points reflecting the impact of the 1.5% reduction in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve in March 2020 and related changes in other short-term rates.\nAverage investment securities increased $3.6 billion, or 4%, primarily due to an increase in residential mortgage-backed securities. Average investment securities represented 22% of average interest-earning assets in 2020, compared to 24% in 2019.\nAverage loans grew $17.6 billion, or 8%, driven by commercial and consumer loan growth. Average commercial loans increased by $15.5 billion, or 10%, reflecting new production, including PPP lending under the CARES Act, and higher multifamily agency warehouse lending, partially offset by lower average utilization of loan commitments.\nAverage consumer loans increased $2.1 billion, or 3%, to $77.8 billion as growth in residential mortgage, auto, unsecured installment and credit card loans was partially offset by declines in education loans due to runoff in the guaranteed government loan portfolio and home equity loan paydowns and payoffs that exceeded new origination volumes.\nAverage loans represented 64% of average interest-earning assets in 2020 compared to 68% in 2019.\nAverage interest-earning deposits grew $30.5 billion as average balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank increased due to higher liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits grew $34.2 billion, or 17%, as growth in commercial and consumer deposits reflected pandemic-related accumulation of customer liquidity. In total, average interest-bearing deposits represented 83% of average interest-bearing liabilities in 2020 compared to 77% in 2019.\nFurther details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Item 7.\nAverage borrowed funds decreased $13.6 billion, or 22%,  primarily due to a decline in FHLB borrowings and federal funds purchased reflecting use of liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n45\nNoninterest Income\nTable 2: Noninterest Income\nNoninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 41% for both 2020 and 2019.\nAsset management revenue declined due to the impact of PNC’s divestiture activity in 2019 of the retirement recordkeeping business and PNC’s proprietary mutual funds, partially offset by the impact of higher average equity markets. PNC’s discretionary client assets under management increased to $170 billion at December 31, 2020 compared with $154 billion at December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to higher equity markets.\nConsumer services revenue declined as a result of lower transaction volumes and activities, reflecting lower consumer spending.\nBroad-based growth in corporate services revenue was driven by higher capital markets-related revenue, primarily from increased equity capital markets advisory fees and asset-backed financing fees, higher revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities and higher treasury management product revenue.\nResidential mortgage revenue increased due to higher loan sales revenue driven by increased loan volume and favorable gain on sale margins and revenue from RMSR valuation, net of economic hedge, partially offset by lower servicing fees due to increased payoff volumes.\nService charges on deposits decreased due to lower transaction volumes, fees waived for customers experiencing pandemic-related hardships and the elimination of certain checking product fees.\nOther noninterest income decreased due to lower revenue from private equity investments reflecting the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic, lower gains on asset sales including the 2019 divestitures of PNC’s retirement recordkeeping business and proprietary mutual funds and higher negative Visa Class B derivative fair value adjustments, primarily related to the extension of anticipated litigation resolution timing, partially offset by higher net securities gains and capital markets-related revenue.\nOther noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Further details regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7. Further details regarding private and other equity investments are included in the Market Risk Management – Equity and Other Investment Risk section.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 3: Noninterest Expense\n46\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe decrease in noninterest expense reflected lower business activity related to the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic, including lower costs associated with business travel, marketing expense and lower equipment expense primarily due to technology-related write-offs in 2019, partially offset by higher personnel expense reflecting continued investment in our employees.\nWe achieved our 2020 continuous improvement program savings goal of $300 million. In 2021, our goal will once again be $300 million in cost savings, without regard to cost saves related to BBVA, which we expect to contribute to the funding of our business and technology investments.\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 12.4% for 2020 compared with 16.4% for 2019. The decrease was primarily due to tax credit benefits and the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits we receive from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings on other tax exempt investments.\nAdditional information regarding our effective tax rate is included in the Reconciliation of Statutory and Effective Tax Rates table in Note 19 Income Taxes in Item 8 of this Report.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nTable 4: Provision for Credit Losses\n(a)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the provision for unfunded lending related commitments was included in the provision for loans and leases.\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.2 billion in 2020 compared to $0.8 billion in 2019. The provision in 2020 was calculated under the CECL accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020. The increase reflected changes due to the adoption of CECL, together with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.\nNet interest income less the provision for credit losses was $6.8 billion, $9.2 billion and $9.3 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.\nNet Income from Discontinued Operations\nThe following table summarizes net income from our investment in BlackRock, which is now reported as discontinued operations as a result of the second quarter 2020 divestiture.\nTable 5: Discontinued Operations\nFor additional details on the divestiture of our equity investment in BlackRock, see Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n47\nC\nONSOLIDATED\nB\nALANCE\nS\nHEET\nR\nEVIEW\nThe summarized balance sheet data in Table 6 is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Item 8 of this Report. For additional detail of the comparison of 2019 over 2018, see the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nTable 6: Summarized Balance Sheet Data\n(a)\nRepresents our held for sale investment in BlackRock. In the second quarter of 2020, PNC divested its entire investment in BlackRock. The prior period BlackRock\ninvestment balance has been reclassified to the Asset held for sale line in accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued\nOperations. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional details.\n(b)    Amount as of December 31, 2020 reflects the impact of adopting the CECL accounting standard and our transition from an incurred loss methodology for these reserves to an expected credit loss methodology. Prior period amounts represent ALLL under the incurred loss methodology. Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional detail on the adoption of this standard.\nOur balance sheet was strong and well-positioned at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\n•\nTotal assets increased as a result of higher interest-earning deposits with banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Bank, loan growth and higher investment securities.\n•\nTotal liabilities increased due to deposit growth reflecting customer liquidity accumulation, partially offset by lower borrowed funds, primarily FHLB borrowings, federal funds purchased and bank notes and senior debt.\n•\nTotal equity increased due to higher retained earnings driven by the gain on sale of our equity investment in BlackRock and higher AOCI, partially offset by dividends on common and preferred stock, share repurchases, the day-one effect of adopting the CECL accounting standard and the redemption of our Series Q preferred stock.\nThe ACL related to loans totaled $5.9 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $2.9 billion since December 31, 2019. The\nincrease was attributable to a $0.6 billion day-one CECL transition adjustment and a $3.1 billion provision for credit losses, partially\noffset by net charge-offs of $0.8 billion. The provision reflects changes due to the adoption of the CECL standard, together with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth. See the following for additional information regarding our ACL related to loans:\n•\nAllowance for Credit Losses in the Credit Risk Management section of this Item 7, and\n•\nNote 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe following discussion provides additional information about the major components of our balance sheet. Information regarding our capital and regulatory compliance is included in the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 and in Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\n48\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nLoans\nTable 7: Loans\nCommercial loans increased primarily due to PPP loan originations and higher multifamily agency warehouse lending, partially offset by lower utilization of loan commitments. At December 31, 2020 PNC had $12.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding.\nFor commercial and industrial loans by industry and commercial real estate loans by geography and property type, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 7.\nTotal consumer loans declined as new originations decreased due to the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and lower consumer spending. Education loans declined primarily due to continued runoff of the government guaranteed education loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans increased as the low interest rate environment resulted in an increase in the volume of originations retained by PNC, primarily of nonconforming loans, which are loans that do not meet agency standards as a result of exceeding agency conforming loan limits.\nFor information on home equity and residential real estate portfolios, including loans by geography, and our auto loan portfolio, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 7.\nFor additional information regarding our loan portfolio, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Item 7 and Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities of $88.8 billion at December 31, 2020 increased $2.0 billion, or 2%, compared to December 31, 2019, due primarily to net purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, partially offset by portfolio run-off of agency residential mortgage-backed securities.\nThe level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering LCR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints. During 2020, $16.2 billion of debt securities were transferred from held to maturity to available for sale pursuant to elections made under recently adopted accounting standards. See further discussion in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n49\nTable 8: Investment Securities\n(a)\nRatings percentages allocated based on amortized cost.\n(b)\nAmortized cost is presented net of applicable allowance for securities of $82 million at December 31, 2020 in accordance with the adoption of the CECL accounting standard. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional detail on the CECL accounting standard.\n(c)\nCollateralized primarily by office buildings, multifamily housing, industrial properties, retail properties and lodging properties.\n(d)\nCollateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed and private education loans and other consumer credit products.\n(e)\nIncludes state and municipal securities.\n(f)\nIncludes available for sale and held to maturity securities, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value and amortized cost, respectively.\nTable 8 presents the distribution of our total investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value, as well as by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and maintain the allowance for securities at an appropriate level to absorb expected credit losses on our investment securities portfolio for the remaining contractual term of the securities adjusted for expected prepayments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional details regarding the methodology for determining the allowance and the amount of the allowance for investment securities, respectively.\nThe duration of investment securities was 2.6 years at December 31, 2020. We estimate that at December 31, 2020 the effective\nduration of investment securities was 3.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.0 years for an\nimmediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2019 for the effective duration of\ninvestment securities were 2.8 years and 2.4 years, respectively.\nBased on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 3.4 years at December 31, 2020 compared to 4.1 years at December 31, 2019.\nTable 9: Weighted-Average Expected Maturities of Mortgage and Asset-Backed Debt Securities\nAdditional information regarding our investment securities is included in Note 3 Investment Securities and Note 15 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n50\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nFunding Sources\nTable 10: Details of Funding Sources\nGrowth in total deposits reflected growth in commercial deposits reflecting pandemic-related accumulation of liquidity by customers and higher consumer deposits driven by government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending.\nBorrowed funds decreased due to lower FHLB borrowings, federal funds purchased (included in other borrowed funds) and bank\nnotes and senior debt, reflecting the use of liquidity from deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in BlackRock.\nThe level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, investment securities and deposit growth and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR requirements and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Item 7 for additional information regarding our 2020 liquidity and capital activities. See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information related to our borrowings.\nShareholders’ Equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity was $54.0 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $4.7 billion, or 10%, compared to December 31, 2019. The increase resulted from net income of $7.6 billion, which included the gain on sale of our equity investment in BlackRock, and higher AOCI of $2.0 billion, partially offset by common and preferred dividends of $2.2 billion, common share repurchases of $1.4 billion, a day-one transition adjustment of $0.7 billion for the adoption of the CECL accounting standard and $0.5 billion for the redemption of our Series Q preferred stock.\nPNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s effort to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic, and continued the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve’s special capital distribution restrictions. We repurchased $99 million of common shares in the third quarter to offset the effects of employee benefit plan-related issuances in 2020 as permitted by guidance from the Federal Reserve. In 2021, our plan is to refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases, during the period leading up to our pending BBVA transaction close date.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n51\nB\nUSINESS\nS\nEGMENTS\nR\nEVIEW\nWe have three reportable business segments:\n•\nRetail Banking\n•\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\n•\nAsset Management Group\nBusiness segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 23 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 23, primarily due to the presentation in this Item 7 of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis. Note 23 presents results of businesses for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested our entire 22.4% investment in BlackRock, which had previously been reported as a separate business segment. See Note 2 Acquisition and Divestiture Activity\nin the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the sale and details on our results and cash flows for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNet interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.\nTotal business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category as shown in Table 114 in Note 23 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited businesses, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP).\nSee the Executive Summary of this Item 7 for our discussion of the impact of pandemic-related developments on our business and operations, including pandemic relief efforts for our customers. We have granted loan modifications through various hardship relief programs to assist our customers in need during the pandemic. See Loan Modifications in the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications section of Credit Risk Management for details on these programs.\n52\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nRetail Banking\nRetail Banking’s core strategy is to acquire and retain customers who maintain their primary checking and transaction relationships with us. We seek to deepen relationships by meeting the broad range of our customers’ financial needs with savings, liquidity, lending, investment and retirement solutions. A strategic priority for us is to differentiate the customer experience and drive transformation and automation. A key element of our strategy is to expand the use of lower-cost alternative distribution channels, with an emphasis on digital capabilities, while continuing to optimize the traditional branch network. In addition, we have a disciplined process to continually improve the engagement of both our employees and customers, which is a strong driver of customer growth, retention and relationship expansion.\nTable 11: Retail Banking Table\n(continued on following page)\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n53\n(continued from previous page)\n(a)\nRepresents mortgage loan servicing balances for third parties and the related income.\n(b)\nPresented as of period end, except for average customer-related statistics and net charge-offs, which are both shown for the year ended, respectively.\n(c)\nServicing fees net of impact of decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan payments, prepayments, and loans that were paid down or paid off during the period.\n(d)\nMortgages with borrowers as part of residential real estate purchase transactions.\n(e)\nPercentage of total consumer and business banking deposit transactions processed at an ATM or through our mobile banking application.\n(f)\nRepresents consumer checking relationships that process the majority of their transactions through non-teller channels.\n(g)\nExcludes stand-alone mortgage offices and satellite offices (e.g., drive-ups, electronic branches and retirement centers) that provide limited products and/or services.\n(h)\nIncludes cash and money market balances.\nRetail Banking earned $0.8 billion in 2020 compared with $1.2 billion in 2019. The decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to a higher provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income.\nNet interest income increased primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of loans, as well as growth in average deposits and average loan balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.\nNoninterest income decreased largely due to declines in service charges on deposits as a result of fees waived for customers experiencing pandemic-related hardships and the elimination of certain checking product fees, as well as a decline in consumer services, including merchant services, and credit and debit card. Lower noninterest income also reflected the impact of negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares of $195 million in 2020 compared with negative adjustments of $100 million in 2019. These declines were partially offset by growth in residential mortgage revenue attributable to increased loan sales revenue as a result of the low interest rate environment and higher revenue from residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.\n54\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nProvision for credit losses increased in 2020 compared to 2019 reflecting changes due to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard, together with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic.\nNoninterest expense increased marginally, primarily as a result of higher personnel, branch-related expenses due in part to the impacts of the pandemic, equipment, and technology costs, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing.\nThe deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In 2020, average total deposits increased compared to 2019 primarily driven by growth in demand and savings deposits which benefited from the impact of government stimulus payments and lower consumer spending due to the pandemic. Savings and demand deposits also increased due, in part, to a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products.\nRetail Banking average total loans grew in 2020 compared with 2019:\n•\nAverage commercial loans increased primarily due to PPP loans.\n•\nAverage residential real estate loans increased primarily as a result of growth in nonconforming residential mortgages and a robust refinance market driven by historically low interest rates.\n•\nAverage auto loan balances in 2020 grew at a lower rate than in recent years due to the impacts of the pandemic on auto sales.\n•\nAverage other consumer loans in 2020 increased at a lower rate than in 2019 as growth in the first quarter of 2020 primarily driven by unsecured installment loan originations through digital channels was muted for the remainder of the year as originations declined in part due to effects of the pandemic and customer behavior.\n•\nAverage credit card balances increased marginally in 2020 as balance growth in the first quarter of 2020 was largely offset by lower consumer spending for the remainder of the year due to the effects of the pandemic.\n•\nAverage education loans decreased driven by a decline in the runoff portfolio of government guaranteed education loans.\n•\nAverage home equity loans decreased as paydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated volume.\nIn 2018, we launched our national expansion strategy designed to grow customers with digitally-led banking and a thin branch network in markets outside of our existing retail branch network and began offering our digital high yield savings deposit product and opened our first solution center in Kansas City. Solution centers are an emerging branch operating model with a distinctive layout, where routine transactions are supported through a combination of technology and skilled banker assistance to create personalized customer experiences. The primary focus of the solution center is to bring a community element to our digital banking capabilities. The solution center provides a collaborative environment that connects our customers with our digital solutions and services, beyond deposits and withdrawals. Following the first solution center opening in 2018, four additional solution centers opened in 2019 with a second in Kansas City and three in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. In 2020, we expanded into three new markets, Boston, Houston and Nashville and opened seventeen new solution centers. We also offer digital unsecured installment and small business loans in the expansion markets. Beginning in mid-2021, we expect the BBVA acquisition will accelerate our Retail National expansion efforts to become a coast-to-coast Retail Bank.\nRetail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products. Retail Banking continued to execute on its strategy of transforming the customer experience through transaction channel migration, branch network and home lending process transformations and multi-channel engagement and service strategies. We are also continually assessing our current branch network for optimization opportunities as usage of alternative channels has increased and have closed 162 branches in 2020.\n•\nApproximately 74% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions in 2020 compared with 69% in 2019, in part reflecting consumer transaction behavior changes during the pandemic.\n•\nDeposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 64% of total deposit transactions in 2020 from 57% in 2019,  in part reflecting consumer transaction behavior changes during the pandemic.\nRetail Banking continues to make progress on its multi-year initiative to redesign the home lending process, including integrating mortgage and home equity lending into a common platform. Technology enhancements supported increased residential mortgage origination volume. In addition, we enhanced the home equity origination process to make it easier and to reach additional customers by offering the product in new states. The enhanced product is currently available in forty-three states and we are moving toward offering the product in most of the remaining states in 2021. Additional improvements for both mortgage and home equity are planned to continue throughout 2021.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n55\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\nCorporate & Institutional Banking’s strategy is to be the leading relationship-based provider of traditional banking products and services to its customers through the economic cycles. We aim to grow our market share and drive higher returns by delivering value-added solutions that help our clients better run their organizations, all while maintaining prudent risk and expense management. We continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive.\nTable 12: Corporate & Institutional Banking Table\n* - Not Meaningful\n(a)\nSee the additional revenue discussion regarding treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities in the Product Revenue section of this Corporate & Institutional Banking section.\n(b)\nAmounts are reported in net interest income and noninterest income.\n(c)\nRepresents other noninterest income for valuations on commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, derivative valuations, originations fees, gains on sale of loans held for sale and net interest income on loans held for sale.\n56\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n(d)\nRepresents net interest income and noninterest income (primarily in corporate service fees) from loan servicing net of reduction in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to amortization expense and payoffs. Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge is shown separately.\n(e)\nAmounts are reported in corporate service fees.\n(f)\nAs of December 31.\nCorporate & Institutional Banking earned $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to $2.4 billion in 2019, as higher provision for credit losses was partially offset by higher revenue.\nNet interest income increased in the comparison primarily due to higher average loan and deposit balances and wider interest rate spreads on the value of loans, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.\nGrowth in noninterest income in the comparison reflected broad-based increases including higher capital markets-related revenue, revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities and treasury management product revenue.\nProvision for credit losses increased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily reflecting changes due to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard, together with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality.\nNonperforming assets at December 31, 2020 and net loan and lease charge-offs for 2020 increased over the comparative periods of 2019 primarily related to industries economically impacted by the pandemic.\nNoninterest expense increased in the comparison largely due to higher variable costs associated with increased business activity and investments in strategic initiatives.\nAverage loans increased compared with 2019 due to strong growth in Corporate Banking, PNC Real Estate and Commercial Banking:\n•\nCorporate Banking provides lending, equipment financing, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business grew reflecting new production, including PPP loan originations, partially offset by lower average utilization of loan commitments.\n•\nPNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business increased primarily driven by higher commercial mortgage and multifamily agency warehouse lending, partially offset by project loan payoffs.\n•\nCommercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business increased primarily driven by PPP loan originations, partially offset by lower average utilization of loan commitments.\n•\nBusiness Credit provides asset-based lending and equipment financing solutions. The loan and lease portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by marketable collateral. Average loans for this business were relatively unchanged as new originations were mostly offset by lower average utilization of loan commitments.\nThe deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits increased in the comparison reflecting customers maintaining liquidity due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the interest rate environment and make adjustments in response to evolving market conditions, bank funding needs and client relationship dynamics.\nCorporate & Institutional Banking continues to expand its Corporate Banking business, focused on the middle market and larger sectors. We executed on our expansion plans into the Seattle and Portland markets in 2020, and in 2021, we expect the BBVA acquisition to accelerate our expansion efforts across the Southwest, but this has not changed our strategy regarding our de novo expansion efforts. This follows offices opened in Boston and Phoenix in 2019, Denver, Houston and Nashville in 2018, and Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis in 2017. These locations complement Corporate & Institutional Banking national businesses with a significant presence in these cities, and build on past successes in the markets where PNC’s retail banking presence was limited, such as in the Southeast. Our full suite of commercial products and services is offered in these locations.\nProduct Revenue\nIn addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a business perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 12 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n57\nThe Treasury Management business provides payables, receivables, deposit and account services, liquidity and investments, and online and mobile banking products and services to our clients. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income primarily includes revenue from all treasury management customer deposit balances. Compared with 2019, treasury management revenue increased primarily due to higher deposit balances and product revenue, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.\nCapital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities underwriting, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. The increase in capital markets-related revenue in the comparison was broad-based across most products and services and included higher credit valuations and fees on customer-related derivatives activities, underwriting fees, equity capital market advisory fees and asset-backed financing fees.\nCommercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (both net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased in the comparison due to higher revenue across all activities.\n58\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nAsset Management Group\nAsset Management Group is focused on being a premier bank-held individual and institutional asset manager in each of the markets it serves. The business seeks to deliver high quality banking, trust and investment management services to our high net worth, ultra high net worth and institutional client sectors through a broad array of products and services. Asset Management Group’s priorities are to serve our clients’ financial objectives, grow and deepen customer relationships and deliver solid financial performance with prudent risk and expense management.\nTable 13: Asset Management Group Table\n* - Not Meaningful\n(a)\nAs of December 31.\n(b)\nExcludes brokerage account client assets.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n59\nAsset Management Group earned $255 million in 2020 compared with $262 million in 2019. Earnings decreased primarily due to lower revenue and an increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense.\nNet interest income increased due to growth in average loan and deposit balances and wider interest rate spreads on loans, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.\nNoninterest income decreased due to lower asset management fees resulting from the impact of 2019 divestiture activities and the gains recognized on the retirement recordkeeping and the PNC Capital Advisors investment management business divestitures in the prior period. This decline was partially offset by increases in the average equity markets.\nNoninterest expense decreased in the comparison and was primarily attributable to the impact of the 2019 divestitures and lower variable costs.\nProvision for credit losses increased reflecting changes due to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard, together with the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic.\nAsset Management Group’s discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year primarily attributable to higher equity markets as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Asset Management Group strives to be the leading relationship-based provider of investment, planning, banking and fiduciary services to wealthy individuals and institutions by proactively delivering value-added ideas, solutions and exceptional service.\nWealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100 offices operating in six out of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. The businesses provide customized investments, planning, trust and estate administration and private banking solutions to affluent individuals and ultra-affluent families.\nInstitutional Asset Management provides outsourced chief investment officer, custody, private real estate, cash and fixed income client solutions, and fiduciary retirement advisory services to institutional clients including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies, unions, municipalities, and non-profits.\nWe expect that the BBVA acquisition will allow meaningful opportunities to grow the Asset Management Group segment by entering into new markets for both the Wealth Management and Institutional Asset Management businesses.\nR\nISK\nM\nANAGEMENT\nEnterprise Risk Management\nWe encounter risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. Accordingly, we design our risk governance framework, referred to as the (ERM) Framework, and risk management processes to help manage this risk. We manage risk in light of our risk appetite to optimize long-term shareholder value while supporting our employees, customers and communities.\nOur ERM Framework is structurally aligned with enhanced prudential standards and heightened standards which establish minimum requirements for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework. This Risk Management section describes our ERM Framework which consists of seven core components that provide executive management and the Board of Directors with an aggregate view of significant risks impacting the organization. The seven core components are risk culture, enterprise strategy (including risk appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing), risk governance and oversight, risk identification, risk assessments, risk controls and monitoring, and risk aggregation and reporting (see the figure below). The overall Risk Management section of this Item 7 also provides an analysis of the firm’s Capital Management and our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to Credit, Market, Liquidity and Operational (including Compliance and Information Security). Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within this Risk Management section.\nWe operate within a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. Accordingly, we are actively focused on the timely adoption of applicable regulatory pronouncements within our ERM Framework.\n60\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nRisk Culture\nA strong risk culture helps us make well-informed decisions, ensures individuals conform to the established culture, reduces an individual’s ability to do something for personal gain, and rewards employees working toward a common goal rather than individual interests. Our risk culture reinforces the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior. These protocols are especially critical in terms of our risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and risk management practices.\nManaging risk is every employee’s responsibility. All of our employees individually and collectively are responsible for ensuring the organization is performing with the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management practices and is striving to achieve our stated objectives rather than pursuing individual interests. All employees are also responsible for understanding our Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM Framework and how risk management applies to their respective roles and responsibilities. Employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to identify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required. We reinforce risk management responsibilities through a performance management system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to reinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.\nProactive and open communication, between groups and up to the Board of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of risk issues. Our multi-level risk committee structure provides formal channels to identify and report risk.\nEnterprise Strategy\nWe ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within acceptable risk parameters through our risk appetite, strategic planning, capital planning and stress testing processes. These components are reviewed and approved at least annually by the Board of Directors.\nRisk Appetite\n: Our risk appetite represents the organization’s desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital based risk and liquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. The Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement qualitatively describes the aggregate level of risk we are willing to accept in order to execute our business strategies. Qualitative guiding principles further define each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement. Risk appetite metrics and limits, including forward-looking metrics, quantitatively measure whether we are operating within our stated Risk Appetite. Our risk appetite metrics reflect material risks, align with our established Risk Appetite Framework, balance risk and reward, leverage analytics, and adjust in a timely manner to changes in the external and internal risk environments.\nStrategic Planning\n: Our enterprise and line of business strategic plans outline major objectives, strategies and goals which are expected to be achieved over the next five years while seeking to ensure we remain compliant with all capital, risk appetite and liquidity targets and guidelines. Our CEO and CFO lead the development of the corporate strategic plan, the strategic objectives and the comprehensive identification of material risks that could hinder successful implementation and execution of strategies. Strategic planning is linked to our risk management and capital planning processes.\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing\n: Capital planning helps to ensure we are maintaining safe and sound operations and viability. The capital planning process and the resulting capital plan evolve as our overall risks, activities and risk management practices change. Capital planning aligns with our strategic planning process. Stress testing is an essential element of the capital planning process. Effective stress testing enables us to consider the estimated effect on capital of various hypothetical scenarios.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n61\nRisk Governance and Oversight\nWe employ a comprehensive risk management governance framework to help ensure that risks are identified, balanced decisions are made that consider risk and return, and risks are adequately monitored and managed. Risk committees established within this risk governance and oversight framework provide oversight for risk management activities at the Board of Directors, executive, corporate and business levels. Committee composition is designed to provide effective oversight balanced across the three lines of defense in accordance with the OCC’s Heightened Risk Management and Governance Standards and Guidelines and the Federal Reserve Board's Enhanced Prudential Standards rules. See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report for more information.\nTo ensure the appropriate risks are being taken and effectively managed and controlled, risk is managed across three lines of defense. The Board of Directors’ and each line of defense’s responsibilities are detailed below:\nBoard of Directors –\nThe Board of Directors oversees our risk-taking activities, holds management accountable for adhering to the ERM Framework and is responsible for exercising sound, independent judgment when assessing risk.\nFirst line of defense\n– The front line units are accountable for identifying, owning and managing risks to within acceptable levels while adhering to the ERM Framework. Our businesses strive to enhance risk management and internal control processes within their areas. Integrated and comprehensive processes are designed to adequately manage the business’ risk profile and risk appetite through identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting risks which may significantly impact each business.\nSecond line of defense –\nThe second line of defense is independent from the first line of defense and is responsible for establishing the risk governance framework and the standards by each independent risk area for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting aggregate risks. As the second line of defense, the independent risk areas monitor the risks generated by the first line of defense, review and challenge the implementation of effective risk management practices, and report any issues or exceptions. The risk areas help to ensure processes and controls owned by the businesses are designed and operating as intended, and they may intervene directly in modifying and developing first line of defense risk processes and controls\n.\nThird line of defense\n– As the third line of defense, Internal Audit is independent from the first and second lines of defense. Internal Audit provides the Board of Directors and executive management comprehensive assurance on the effectiveness of the ERM Framework and the risk management practices across the organization.\nWithin the three lines of defense, the independent risk organization has sufficient authority to influence material decisions. Our business oversight and decision-making is supported through a governance structure at the Board of Directors and management level. Specific responsibilities include:\nBoard of Directors –\nOur Board of Directors oversees our business and affairs as managed by our officers and employees. The Board of Directors may receive assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate authority through the following standing committees:\n•\nAudit Committee\n: monitors the integrity of our consolidated financial statements; monitors internal control over financial reporting; monitors compliance with our code of ethics; evaluates and monitors the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and evaluates and monitors the performance of our Internal Audit function and our independent auditors.\n•\nNominating and Governance Committee\n: oversees the implementation of sound corporate governance principles and practices while promoting our best interests and those of our shareholders.\n•\nPersonnel and Compensation Committee\n: oversees the compensation of our executive officers and other specified responsibilities related to personnel and compensation matters affecting us. The committee is also responsible for evaluating the relationship between risk-taking activities and incentive compensation plans.\n•\nRisk Committee\n: oversees enterprise-wide risk structure and the processes established to identify, measure, monitor and manage the organization’s risks and evaluates and approves our risk governance framework. The Risk Committee has formed a Technology Subcommittee and a Compliance Subcommittee to facilitate Board-level oversight of risk management in these areas.\nIn 2020, the Board created the Special Committee on Equity & Inclusion, which assists the Board in its oversight of management’s equity and inclusion efforts, internally and externally, focusing on our systemic processes (including for employees and suppliers); low and moderate income communities (including community development banking, and product offerings and financial support for such communities); and advocacy (including partnerships with leading organizations, and advocacy for necessary structural changes to help provide greater access to the banking system and end systemic racism).\nManagement Level Executive Committee\n–\nThe Management Level Executive Committee is responsible for guiding the creation and execution of our business strategy across the company. With this responsibility, the Management Level Executive Committee executes various strategic approval and review activities, with a focus on capital deployment, business performance and risk management. This Committee also helps ensure PNC is staffed with sufficient resources and talent to operate within its risk appetite.\n62\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nCorporate Committees\n– The Corporate Committees generally operate based on the delegated approval authority from a Board-level Committee, the Management Level Executive Committee or other Corporate Committees. These Committees operate at the senior management level and are designed to facilitate the review, evaluation, oversight and approval of key risk activities.\nWorking Committees\n– The Working Committees generally operate on delegated approval authority from a Corporate Committee, other Working Committees or provide oversight of regulatory/legal matters. Working Committees are intended to assist in the implementation of key enterprise-level activities within a business or function and support the oversight of the businesses key risk activities.\nTransactional Committees\n– Transactional Committees generally operate based on delegated approval authority from a Corporate or Working Committee to approve individual transactions, transactional related activities or movements on the organization's balance sheet.\nPolicies and Procedures\n– We have established risk management Policies and Procedures to support our ERM Framework, articulate our risk culture, define the parameters and processes within which employees are to manage risk and conduct our business activities and to provide direction, guidance and clarity on roles and responsibilities to management and the Board of Directors. These Policies and Procedures are organized in a multi-tiered framework and require periodic review and approval by relevant Committees or management.\nRisk Identification\nRisk identification takes place across a variety of risk types throughout the organization. These risk types include, but are not limited to, credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance. Risks are identified based on a balanced use of analytical tools and management judgment for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. Our governance structure supports risk identification by facilitating assessment of key risk issues, emerging risks and idiosyncratic risks and implementation of mitigation strategies as appropriate. These risks are prioritized based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and assessed against the risk appetite. Multiple tools and approaches are used to help identify and prioritize risks, including Risk Appetite Metrics, Key Risk Indicators, Key Performance Indicators, Risk Control and Self-Assessments, scenario analysis, stress testing and special investigations.\nRisks are aggregated and assessed within and across risk functions or businesses. The aggregated risk information is reviewed and reported at an enterprise level for adherence to the Risk Appetite Framework and approved by the Board of Directors or by appropriate committees. This enterprise aggregation and reporting approach promotes the identification and appropriate escalation of material risks across the organization and supports an understanding of the cumulative impact of risk in relation to our risk appetite.\nRisk Assessment\nOnce risks are identified, they are evaluated based on quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine whether they are material. Risk assessments support the overall management of an effective ERM Framework and allow us to control and monitor our actual risk level and risk management effectiveness through the use of risk measures. Comprehensive, accurate and timely assessments of risk are essential to an effective ERM Framework. Effective risk measurement practices will uncover recurring risks that have been experienced in the past; make the known risks easy to monitor, understand, compare and report; and reveal unanticipated risks that may not be easy to understand or predict.\nRisk Controls and Monitoring\nOur ERM Framework consists of policies, processes, personnel and control systems. Risk controls and limits provide the linkage from our Risk Appetite Statement and associated guiding principles to the risk-taking activities of our businesses. In addition to risk appetite limits, a system of more detailed internal controls exists which oversees and monitors our various processes and functions. These control systems measure performance, help employees make correct decisions, help ensure information is accurate and reliable and document compliance with laws and regulations.\nWe design our monitoring and evaluation of risks and controls to provide assurance that policies, procedures and controls are effective and also to result in the identification of control improvement recommendations. Risk monitoring is a daily, ongoing process used by both the first and second line of defense to ensure compliance with our ERM Framework. Risk monitoring is accomplished in many ways, including performing risk assessments at the prime process and risk assessment unit level, monitoring an area’s key controls, the timely reporting of issues, and establishing a quality control and/or quality assurance function, as applicable.\nRisk Aggregation and Reporting\nRisk reporting is a comprehensive way to: (i) aggregate risks; (ii) identify concentrations; (iii) help ensure we remain within our established risk appetite; (iv) serve as a basis for monitoring our risk profile in relation to our risk appetite and (v) communicate risks to the Board of Directors and executive management.\nRisk reports are produced at the line of business, functional risk and enterprise levels. The enterprise level risk report aggregates risks identified in the risk area reports and in the business reports to define the enterprise risk profile. The enterprise risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of enterprise risk and represents our overall risk position in relation to the desired enterprise risk appetite. The\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n63\ndetermination of the enterprise risk profile is based on analysis of quantitative reporting of risk limits and other measures along with qualitative assessments. Quarterly aggregation of risk reports from the risk areas and lines of business to inform our risk profile enables a clear view of our risk level relative to our quantitative risk appetite. The enterprise level report is provided through the governance structure to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nEach individual risk report includes an assessment of inherent risk, quality of risk management, residual risk, risk appetite and risk outlook. The enterprise level risk report includes an aggregate view of risks identified in the individual report and provides a summary of our overall risk profile compared to our risk appetite.\nCredit Risk Management\nCredit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are designed to be embedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk appetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board of Directors through our governance structure. Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.\nLoan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis\nTable 14: Details of Loans\nIn billions\nWe use several credit quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about the significant loan classes that comprise our Commercial and Consumer portfolio segments.\nCommercial\nEnvironmental and social risks are incorporated into the transaction and portfolio management policies and procedures that govern our underwriting and portfolio management practices. All Corporate & Institutional Banking transactions are subject to an Environmental and Social Risk Management assessment designed to help us better identify and mitigate environmental, human rights and other social risks early in the credit application process. Transactions identified as having a potential environmental, human rights or other social risk are evaluated to determine whether enhanced due diligence is warranted. We have also chosen to limit new originations in sectors that are no longer consistent with our strategic direction, such as mountain-top removal coal mining and private prisons. We periodically review environmental and social risk topics in PNC’s Credit Portfolio Strategy Committee, and outcomes of these reviews may result in changes to our due diligence, origination requirements, or limits on credit exposure. Our approach to identifying environmental and social risks is regularly reviewed by senior management and overseen by our Board of Directors. PNC will continue to refine its approach as banking conditions, regulatory requirements, investors’ perspectives and our strategic direction evolve.\n64\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nC\nommercial and Industrial\nCommercial and industrial loans comprised 55% and 52% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of our commercial and industrial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, real estate and other business assets.\nWe actively manage our commercial and industrial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to monitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geography that may exist in our portfolio. Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified as shown in the following table which provides a breakout by industry classification (classified based on the NAICS).\nTable 15: Commercial and Industrial Loans by Industry\n(a) Represents loans to customers in the real estate and construction industries.\nCommercial and industrial loan growth at December 31, 2020 primarily reflects the impact of PPP lending under the CARES Act and higher multifamily agency warehouse lending, partially offset by lower utilization of loan commitments. At December 31, 2020 PNC had $12.0 billion of PPP loans outstanding. See the Commercial High Impact Industries discussion within this Credit Risk Management section for additional discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial portfolio and how we are evaluating and monitoring the portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk.\nCommercial Real Estate\nCommercial real estate loans comprised $17.3 billion related to commercial mortgages, $6.3 billion of real estate project loans and $5.1 billion of intermediate term financing loans as of December 31, 2020. Comparable amounts were $17.0 billion, $5.6 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nWe monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with these types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n65\nThe following table presents our commercial real estate loans by geography and property type:\nTable 16: Commercial Real Estate Loans by Geography and Property Type\n(a) Presented in descending order based on loan balances at December 31, 2020.\nCommercial High Impact Industries\nIn light of the current economic circumstances related to COVID-19, we are evaluating and monitoring our entire commercial portfolio for elevated levels of credit risk; however, the industry sectors that have been and we believe will continue to be most likely impacted by the effects of the pandemic are:\n•\nNon-real estate related\n•\nLeisure recreation: restaurants, casinos, hotels, convention centers\n•\nNon-essential retail: retail excluding auto, gas, staples\n•\nHealthcare facilities: elective, private practices\n•\nConsumer services: religious organizations, childcare\n•\nLeisure travel: cruise, airlines, other travel/transportation\n•\nOther impacted areas: shipping, senior living, specialty education\n•\nReal estate related\n•\nNon-essential retail and restaurants: malls, lifestyle centers, outlets, restaurants\n•\nHotel: full service, limited service, extended stay\n•\nSeniors housing: assisted living, independent living\nAs of December 31, 2020, our outstanding loan balances in these industries totaled $17.2 billion, or approximately 7% of our total loan portfolio, while additional unfunded loan commitments totaled $11.2 billion. We continue to carefully monitor and manage these loans, and while we have not yet experienced material charge-offs in these industries, we do expect to see further stress.\nIn our non-real estate related category we have $9.7 billion in loans outstanding, $1.9 billion of which are funded through the PPP and guaranteed by the SBA under the CARES Act. Nonperforming loans in these industries totaled $0.1 billion, or 1% of total loans outstanding in the non-real estate related category, while criticized assets totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2020 with the greatest stress seen in the leisure recreation and leisure travel sectors.\nWithin the real estate related category we have $7.5 billion in loans outstanding, which includes real estate projects of $5.0 billion and unsecured real estate of $2.5 billion. Nonperforming loans in this category totaled $0.2 billion at December 31, 2020, or 3% of total\n66\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nloans outstanding in the commercial real estate related category, driven primarily by loans related to two real estate investment trusts.  In this category, we continue to see substantial stress in the non-essential retail and hotel segments.\nOil and Gas Loan Portfolio\nWe are also monitoring our oil and gas portfolio closely for elevated levels of credit risk given the continued pressures on the energy industry. As of December 31, 2020, our outstanding loans in the oil and gas sector totaled $3.4 billion, or 1% of total loans, which included $0.1 billion funded through the PPP and guaranteed by the SBA under the CARES Act. This portfolio comprised approximately $1.6 billion in the midstream and downstream sectors, $0.9 billion of oil services companies and $0.9 billion related to exploration and production companies. Of the oil services category, approximately $0.2 billion is not asset-based or investment grade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas sector as of December 31, 2020 totaled $0.2 billion, or 6% of total loans outstanding in this sector. Additional unfunded loan commitments for the oil and gas portfolio totaled $7.1 billion at December 31, 2020.\nConsumer\nHome Equity\nHome equity loans comprised $12.6 billion of primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $11.5 billion of closed-end home equity installment loans at December 31, 2020. Comparable amounts were $13.9 billion and $11.2 billion, as of December 31, 2019, respectively.\nWe track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original LTVs, updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs at least quarterly, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of whether we hold the lien. We also segment the population into pools based on product type (\ne.g.\n, home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.\nThe credit quality of newly originated loans in 2020 was strong overall with a weighted-average LTV on originations of 67% and a weighted-average FICO score of 776.\nThe credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally determined at the time of origination and monitored on an ongoing basis for risk management purposes. We use an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan information, including lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.\nThe following table presents our home equity loans by geography and lien type:\nTable 17: Home Equity Loans by Geography and by Lien Type\n(a) Presented in descending order based on loan balances at December 31, 2020.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n67\nResidential Real Estate\nResidential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe track borrower performance of this portfolio monthly similarly to home equity loans. We also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (\ne.g.\n, nonconforming, conforming). This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan servicers.\nThe credit quality of newly originated loans that we retained on our balance sheet in 2020 was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted-average LTV on originations of 67% and a weighted-average FICO score of 775.\nThe following table presents our residential real estate loans by geography:\nTable 18: Residential Real Estate Loans by Geography\n(a) Presented in descending order based on loan balances at December 31, 2020.\nWe originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. The originated nonconforming residential mortgage portfolio had strong credit quality at December 31, 2020 with an average original LTV of 69% and an average original FICO score of 775. Our portfolio of originated nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $17.9 billion at December 31, 2020 with 41% located in California.\nAutomobile\nWithin auto loans, $12.7 billion resided in the indirect auto portfolio while $1.5 billion were in the direct auto portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2019 were $15.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio pertains to loans originated through franchised dealers, including from expansion into new markets. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.\nThe following table presents certain key statistics related to our indirect and direct auto portfolios:\nTable 19: Auto Loan Key Statistics\n(a) Weighted-averages calculated for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n68\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nWe continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by the weighted-average loan origination FICO scores noted in Table 19. We offer both new and used auto financing to customers through our various channels. At December 31, 2020, the portfolio balance was composed of 56% new vehicle loans and 44% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were 55% and 45%, respectively.\nThe auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.\nNonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming TDRs, OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Amounts as of December 31, 2019 also excluded purchased impaired loans as we were accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. In connection with the adoption of the CECL standard, nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2020 include PCD loans which meet the criteria to be classified as nonperforming. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for details on our nonaccrual policies and additional information related to the adoption of the CECL standard, including the discontinuation of purchased impaired loan accounting.\nThe following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets by major category:\nTable 20: Nonperforming Assets by Type\n(a)\nExcludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.\n(b)\nRatio at December 31, 2020 reflects the changes in ALLL methodology due to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, along with increases in reserves during 2020 due to the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on loan portfolio credit quality and loan growth.\nThe increase in nonperforming assets at December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to higher nonperforming commercial loans in industries adversely impacted by the pandemic and the energy industry and an increase in residential real estate nonperforming loans primarily related to borrowers exiting forbearance and deferring payments to the end of the loan term, partially offset by the decline in OREO and foreclosed assets due to asset sales and the suspension of pandemic-related foreclosures. See the discussion of Commercial High Impact Industries and the Oil and Gas Loan Portfolio within this Credit Risk Management section for further detail on these industries.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n69\nThe following table provides details on the change in nonperforming assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 21: Change in Nonperforming Assets\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 97% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 83% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs and interest applied to principal, before consideration of the ALLL.\nWithin consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprised 47% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans, while home equity TDRs comprised 41% of home equity nonperforming loans at December 31, 2020. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were 79% and 49%, respectively. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. Loans that have been restructured for COVID-19 related hardships and meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not identified as TDRs. Refer to the Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications discussion in this Credit Risk Management section for more information on the treatment of loan modifications under the CARES Act.\nAt December 31, 2020, our largest nonperforming asset was $141 million in the Real Estate and Rental and Leasing industry and the ten largest individual nonperforming assets represented 19% of total nonperforming assets.\nLoan Delinquencies\nWe regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of credit quality in our loan portfolio. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option, and at December 31, 2020 also include PCD loans. Amounts exclude loans held for sale, while amounts as of December 31, 2019 also excluded purchased impaired loans.\nPursuant to the interagency guidance issued in April 2020 and in connection with the credit reporting rules from the CARES Act, the  December 31, 2020 delinquency status of loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships aligns with the rules set forth for banks to report delinquency status to the credit agencies. These rules require that COVID-19 related loan modifications be reported as follows:\n•\nif current at the time of modification, the loan remains current throughout the modification period,\n•\nif delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was not made current as part of the modification, the loan maintains its reported delinquent status during the modification period, or\n•\nif delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was made current as part of the modification or became current during the modification period, the loan is reported as current.\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships are not being reported as past due as of  December 31, 2020 based on the contractual terms of the loan, even where borrowers may not be making payments on their loans during the modification period. Loan modifications due to COVID-19 related hardships that permanently reduce either the contractual interest rate or the principal balance of a loan do not qualify for TDR relief under the CARES Act or the interagency guidance. See the COVID-19 Relief section in Item 1 of this Report for more information on the CARES Act and the related interagency guidance.\n70\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nTable 22: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)\n(a)\nPast due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $0.6 billion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more continue to accrue interest because they are (i) well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, (ii) managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines or (iii) certain government insured or guaranteed loans. As such, they are excluded from nonperforming loans.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court-imposed concessions (\ne.g.,\na Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan). Loans to borrowers experiencing COVID-19 related hardships that have been restructured but that meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not categorized as TDRs.\nThe following table provides a summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\nTable 23: Summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings (a)\n(a)\nAmounts in table do not include associated valuation allowances.\n(b)\nAccruing loans include consumer credit card loans and certain loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.\nNonperforming TDRs represented approximately 39% of total nonperforming loans and 55% of total TDRs at December 31, 2020. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were 52% and 51%, respectively.The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual status after performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report and the COVID-19 Relief section within Item 1 of this Report for additional information on TDRs. For additional information on the CARES Act, also see the COVID-19 Relief section within Item 1 of this Report.\nLoan  Modifications\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, PNC continued to provide relief to our customers from the economic impacts of COVID-19 through a variety of solutions, including additional grants and extensions of loan and lease modifications under our hardship relief programs.\nUnder the CARES Act, loan modifications meeting certain criteria qualify the loan for relief from TDR treatment. These criteria include:\n•\nthe loan modification resulted from a COVID-19 related hardship,\n•\nthe borrower was no more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and\n•\nthe loan modification did not result in a permanent reduction of interest or principal.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n71\nLoans that do not meet the criteria for TDR relief under the CARES Act may be evaluated under interagency guidance, which allows banks to not designate certain short-term modifications as TDRs for borrowers with COVID-19 hardships who were current on their payments prior to the modification. Loan modifications related to COVID-19 hardships that permanently reduce either the contractual interest rate and/or principal balance of the loan are designated as TDRs. For additional information on the CARES Act and interagency guidance, see the COVID-19 Relief section within Item 1 of this Report.\nThe impact of these modifications was considered within the quarterly reserve determination. See the Allowance for Credit Losses discussion within the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section for additional information. Refer to the Loan Delinquencies discussion in this Credit Risk Management section for information on how these hardship related loan modifications are reported from a delinquency perspective as of December 31, 2020.\nCommercial Loan and Lease Modifications Under COVID-19 Hardship Relief Programs\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, PNC continued to selectively grant temporary loan and lease modifications to our commercial clients although the volume of this activity declined significantly from earlier in the year. Modifications made were in the form of principal and/or interest (payment) deferrals, covenant waivers and other types of modifications, including term extensions, and were based on each individual borrower’s situation.\nCommercial accounts in active assistance under COVID-19 hardship relief payment deferral programs totaled $0.1 billion, or 0.1% of total commercial loans at December 31, 2020.\nWe are monitoring the delinquency status of loans exiting assistance as a measure to assess credit risk. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 99% of the accruing commercial loans that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs were current or less than 30 days past due.\nConsumer Loan Modifications Under Hardship Relief Programs\nOur consumer loan modification programs are being granted in response to customer hardships that extended beyond the initial relief period. These loan and line modifications include all hardship related modifications, and the primary offerings as of December 31, 2020 are described in the following matrix.\nInterest continues to accrue during the relief period for loans modified in these programs unless the loan was designated as a nonperforming TDR or was on nonaccrual at the date of modification. The method of collection of the accrued interest is dependent on the product type and modification offered.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued to see a reduction in the number of consumers requesting hardship assistance from the peak in the summer of 2020, which has led to additional declines in loans under modification that present credit risk to PNC at December 31, 2020.\n72\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table provides a summary of consumer accounts in active assistance under hardship relief programs that were on our balance sheet at December 31, 2020. We have excluded government insured or guaranteed loans totaling $426 million and $262 million in the Residential real estate and Education loan classes, respectively, from Table 24 as these loans present minimal credit risk to PNC.\nTable 24:  Consumer Loans in Active Hardship Relief Programs (a) (b)\n(a) In cases where there have been multiple modifications on an individual loan, regardless of the number of modifications granted, each loan is counted only once in this table.\n(b) Amounts include loan modifications that qualify for TDR accounting totaling $149 million.\n(c) Based on total loans outstanding at December 31, 2020.\n(d) Approximately 86% of these loan balances were secured by collateral at December 31, 2020.\nModifications are considered to have exited active assistance after the modification period has expired or the modification was exited.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately 95% of the accruing consumer loans that have exited hardship relief program modifications were current or less than 30 days past due.\nThe initial consumer loan modifications granted in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the surrounding economic circumstances were short-term and temporary in nature and generally meet the qualifications for relief from TDR treatment under the CARES Act. However, in response to customers’ hardships that have extended beyond the initial relief period, PNC has offered options to customers which include both temporary and permanent modifications that may reduce the payment, the interest rate or extend the term and/or defer principal and interest payments. Loan modifications that permanently reduce either the contractual interest rate and/or principal balance of the loan would not meet the qualifications for relief from TDR treatment under the CARES Act.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020 we adopted the CECL standard which replaced the incurred loss methodology for our credit related reserves with an expected credit loss methodology for the remaining estimated contractual term of in-scope assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Our ACL is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an appropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, trade receivables and other financial assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date.\nExpected losses are estimated using a combination of (i) the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) a period of reversion to long run average expected losses where applicable and (iii) long run average expected losses for the remaining estimated contractual term.\nWe use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period. For this purpose, we have established a framework which includes a three year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios and associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes over the forecasted period. Forward looking information, such as forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, is incorporated into the expected credit loss estimates using quantitative techniques, as well as through analysis from PNC’s economists and management’s judgment in qualitatively assessing the ACL.\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our three year reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long run average expected credit losses. We may consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such as contractual maturity of the asset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the long run average period. The reversion period is typically 1-3 years, if not immediate.\nThe long run average expected credit losses are derived from our available historical credit information. We use long run average\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n73\nexpected loss for the portfolio over the estimated remaining contractual term beyond our forecast period and the reversion period.\nThe following discussion provides additional information related to our reserves under CECL for loans and leases as well as unfunded lending related commitments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion on our ACL, including details of our methodologies and discussion of the allowances for investment securities and other financial assets. See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based upon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD and the remaining estimated contractual term for a loan or loan segment. We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on contractual maturity in our expected loss estimates. We use historical data, current borrower characteristics and forecasted economic variables in quantitative methods to estimate these risk parameters by loan or loan segments. PDs represent a quantification of risk that a borrower may not be able to pay their contractual obligation over a defined period of time. LGD describes the estimate of potential loss if a borrower were to default, and EAD (or utilization rates for revolving loans) is the estimated balance outstanding at the time of default and expected loss. These parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario in proportion to the scenario weights.\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology for our consumer real estate related loan classes and for certain commercial and consumer TDR loans. For non-TDR residential real estate loans and lines, we determine effective interest rates considering contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayments and market interest rates. We then determine the net present value of expected cash flows and ALLL by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for both prepayments and expected credit losses using the effective interest rates.\nWe establish individually assessed reserves for loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans using methods prescribed by GAAP. Reserves for individual commercial nonperforming loans and commercial TDRs exceeding a defined dollar threshold are based on an analysis of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans. Commercial loans that are below the defined threshold and accruing TDRs are collectively reserved for, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics. For consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts previously charged-off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant credit risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between expected and actual outcomes. We may hold additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. A portion of the allowance is related to qualitative measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nIndustry concentrations and conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19 on highly impacted segments,\n•\nChanges in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements,\n•\nChanges in the nature and volume of our portfolio,\n•\nRecent credit quality trends, including the impact of COVID-19 hardship related loan modifications,\n•\nRecent loss experience in particular portfolios, including specific and unique events,\n•\nRecent macro-economic factors that may not be reflected in the forecast information,\n•\nLimitations of available input data, including historical loss information and recent data such as collateral values,\n•\nModel imprecision and limitations,\n•\nChanges in lending policies and procedures, including changes in loss recognition and mitigation policies and procedures, and\n•\nTiming of available information, including the performance of first lien positions.\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related Commitments\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable, (\ne.g.,\nunfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and certain financial guarantees) at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for loans and leases. The allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to this reserve are included in the provision for credit losses.\n74\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table summarizes our allowance for credit loss by loan class:\nTable 25: Allowance for Credit Losses by Loan Class (a)\n(a)        Excludes allowances for investment securities and other financial assets, which together totaled $109 million at December 31, 2020.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n75\nThe following table summarizes our loan charge-offs and recoveries:\nTable 26: Loan Charge-Offs and Recoveries\nTotal net charge-offs increased $190 million, or 30%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to commercial net charge-offs, which were driven by industries adversely impacted by the pandemic.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available. We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.\nManagement monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity stress event. In addition, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress event. In the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that our liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. The simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated runoff of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund committed obligations. Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. Liquidity-related risk limits are established within our Enterprise Liquidity Management Policy\n76\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nand supporting policies. Management committees, including the Asset and Liability Committee, and the Board of Directors and its Risk Committee regularly review compliance with key established limits.\nIn addition to these liquidity monitoring measures and tools described above, we also monitor our liquidity by reference to the LCR which is further described in the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR on a daily basis, and as of December 31, 2020, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the requirement of 100%.\nWe provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements, including information on the 2019 Tailoring Rules, and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $365.3 billion at December 31, 2020 from $288.5 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits. See the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Item 7 for additional information related to our deposits. Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid as well as unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity position.\nAt December 31, 2020, our liquid assets consisted of cash and due from banks and short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $95.1 billion and securities available for sale totaling $87.4 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Our liquid assets included $22.7 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $0.1 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.\nWe also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Item 7 for additional information related to our borrowings.\nTotal senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, decreased due to the following activity:\nTable 27: Senior and Subordinated Debt\nBank Liquidity\nUnder PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At December 31, 2020, PNC Bank had $19.2 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $14.2 billion were senior bank notes and $5.0 billion were subordinated bank notes.\nThe following table details issuances in 2020:\nTable 28:  PNC Bank Notes Issued\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n77\nThe following table details redemptions in 2020:\nTable 29:  PNC Bank Notes Redeemed\nPNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At December 31, 2020, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $81.1 billion. The Federal Reserve also has established certain special liquidity facilities under its emergency lending authority in Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act in response to the economic impacts of the pandemic.\nFor additional information, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report.\nPNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.\nParent Company Liquidity\nIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, available parent company liquidity totaled $14.1 billion. Parent company liquidity is held in intercompany cash. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.\nThe principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:\n•\nBank-level capital needs,\n•\nLaws and regulations,\n•\nCorporate policies,\n•\nContractual restrictions, and\n•\nOther factors.\nThere are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020. See Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for a further discussion of these limitations.\n78\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nIn addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. Authorized by the Board of Directors, the parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2020 there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.\nThe parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments. On January 22, 2020, the parent company issued $2.0 billion of senior notes with a maturity date of January 22, 2030, redeemable, in whole or in part, on or after October 24, 2029. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 2.550% per annum, on January 22 and July 22 of each year, commencing on July 22, 2020.\nParent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $10.6 billion at December 31, 2020 compared with $9.8 billion at December 31, 2019.\nPNC will use approximately $11.6 billion of parent company cash to acquire BBVA.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following tables set forth contractual obligations and various other commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 30: Contractual Obligations\n(a)\nIncludes basis adjustment relating to accounting hedges.\n(b)\nIncludes purchase obligations for goods and services covered by noncancellable contracts and contracts including cancellation fees.\nTable 31: Other Commitments (a)\n(a)\nOther commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. Loan commitments are reported net of syndications, assignments and participations.\n(b)\nCommitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions.\n(c)\nIncludes $3.8 billion of standby letters of credit that support remarketing programs for customers’ variable rate demand notes.\n(d)\nIncludes other commitments of $0.6 billion that were not on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $1.4 billion of other commitments were included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCredit Ratings\nPNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.\nIn general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n79\nThe following table presents credit ratings for PNC and PNC Bank as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 32: Credit Ratings for PNC and PNC Bank\nOn November 16, 2020, Moody’s affirmed the ratings and assessments of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. At the same time, the Moody’s rating outlook on PNC Bank’s long-term deposit, senior unsecured debt and issuer ratings were changed from stable to negative, based on Moody’s view that recent deposit growth and the acquisition of BBVA may reduce the amount of unsecured debt on PNC’s balance sheet, a key input in Moody’s rating methodology.\nCapital Management\nWe manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.\nIn 2020, we returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases of 11 million shares for $1.5 billion and dividends on common shares of $2.0 billion.\nWe repurchase shares of PNC common stock under a share repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors in the amount of up to 100 million shares and consistent with capital plans submitted to the Federal Reserve. Repurchases are made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and the extent and timing of share repurchases under authorizations depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the OCC as part of the CCAR and DFAST processes.\nIn relation to the 2019 capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve, we repurchased a total of 24 million shares for $3.4 billion as of the end of the first quarter 2020.\nPNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s effort to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic.\nFollowing completion of the 2020 CCAR/DFAST process, the Federal Reserve announced certain limitations on the capital distributions of any CCAR-participating bank holding company (including PNC) during the third quarter of 2020. Under these limitations, PNC and other CCAR-participating firms, absent Federal Reserve approval, were permitted to make only the following capital distributions during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020:\n•\nPay common dividends at the same per share level as paid during the second quarter of 2020, provided that the amount does not exceed the average of the firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters,\n•\nPurchase common shares in an amount that equals the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation, and\n•\nMake scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments.\nWe continued the suspension of our common stock repurchase program through the fourth quarter of 2020, with the exception of employee benefit-related repurchases in the third quarter, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve’s special capital distribution restrictions.\nThe Federal Reserve extended these limitations through the first quarter of 2021, but modified the limitations to permit common stock share repurchases and dividends provided that the aggregate amount of such repurchases and dividends do not exceed the average of\n80\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nthe firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters and the firm does not increase its common dividend. The Federal Reserve may extend these limitations to additional quarters, potentially in modified form. In 2021, our plan is to refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases, during the period leading up to our pending BBVA transaction close date.\nOn January 5, 2021, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per share payable on February 5, 2021.\nSee the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business in this Report for further information concerning the CCAR and DFAST process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans.\nTable 33: Basel III Capital\n(a)\nThe ratios are calculated to reflect PNC’s election to adopt the CECL five-year transition provision.\n(b)\nThe ratios are calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and excludes the benefits of the optional five-year transition.\n(c)\nBasel III standardized approach weighted-assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.\n(d)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the BHC's Supplementary leverage exposure and Supplementary leverage ratio reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure, which takes into account both on balance sheets assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure under derivative contracts.\n(e)\nAll ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC and calculated based on the standardized approach.\n(f)\nThe Basel III Total risk-based capital ratios include nonqualifying trust preferred capital securities of $40 million that are subject to a phase-out period that runs through 2021.\n(g)\nLeverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.\nAs of January 1, 2020, the 2019 Tailoring Rules became effective for PNC. The most significant changes involve PNC’s election to\nexclude specific AOCI items from CET1 capital and higher thresholds used to calculate CET1 capital deductions. Effective January 1, 2020, PNC must deduct from CET1 capital investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets (in each case, net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent such items individually exceed 25% of the institution’s adjusted CET1 capital.\nPNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n81\nExposures to high volatility commercial real estate, nonaccruals, TDRs, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.\nThe regulatory agencies have adopted a rule permitting banks to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from\nimplementing CECL. CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital, as defined by the rule, is the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date compared to the CECL ACL at transition. The estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 capital through December 31, 2021, then phased-out over the following three years. PNC elected to adopt this optional transition provision effective as of March 31, 2020. See additional discussion of this rule in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report.\nIn response to the economic conditions caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve has adopted a final rule that revises, on a\ntemporary basis, the calculation of supplementary leverage exposure (the denominator of the SLR) by BHCs to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The rule was effective as of April 14, 2020 and will remain in effect through March 31, 2021. The OCC also has permitted national banks to exclude such on-balance sheet amounts from the bank’s supplementary leverage exposure, provided the bank agrees to obtain OCC approval of capital distributions during the effective period of the exclusion. PNC Bank has not elected to take advantage of this OCC rule.\nAt December 31, 2020, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.\nFederal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our December 31, 2020 capital levels were aligned with them.\nWe provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section in Item 8 of this Report for details on our December 31, 2017 and 2016 Fully Phased-in Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratios.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:\n•\nTraditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,\n•\nEquity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and\n•\nFixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.\nWe have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\nMarket Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.\nOur Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n82\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nSensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 follow:\nTable 34: Interest Sensitivity Analysis\n(a)\nGiven the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero. Senior management approved the suspension of the 100bps decrease in rate change sensitivities considering the current low rate environment.\nIn addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 35 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 50 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.\nAll changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.\nTable 35: Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios\nWhen forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 34 and 35. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.\nThe following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.\nTable 36: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward\nThe fourth quarter 2020 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n83\nAs discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors, the planned discontinuance of the requirement that banks submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2023 presents risks to the financial instruments originated, held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate. PNC holds instruments and services its instruments and instruments owned by others that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, hedging products, floating-rate obligations, and other financial instruments that use LIBOR as a reference rate. The transition from LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark will subject PNC, like other financial participants, to financial, legal, operational, and reputational risks.\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the associated risks, PNC has established a cross-functional governance structure to oversee the overall strategy for the transition from LIBOR and mitigate risks associated with the transition. An initial LIBOR impact and risk assessment has been performed, which identified the associated risks across products, systems, models, and processes. PNC also established an enterprise-level program, which is actively monitoring PNC’s overall firm-wide exposure to LIBOR and using these results to plan transitional strategies and track progress versus these goals. Program workstreams were formed by Line of Business to ensure accountability and alignment with the appropriate operational, technology, and customer-facing stakeholders, while establishing a centralized Program Management Office to ensure consistency in execution and communication. Project plans and established milestones have been developed and have continued to evolve and be refined in line with industry developments and internal decisions and progress. PNC is also involved in industry discussions, preparing milestones for readiness and assessing progress against those milestones, along with developing and delivering on internal and external LIBOR cessation communication plans.\nKey efforts in 2020 included:\n•\nEnhancing fallback language in new contracts and reviewing existing legal contracts/agreements to assess fallback language impacts,\n•\nMaking preparations for internal operational readiness,\n•\nMaking necessary enhancements to PNC’s infrastructure, including systems, models, valuation tools and processes,\n•\nDeveloping and delivering on internal and external LIBOR cessation communication plans,\n•\nEngaging with PNC clients, industry working groups and regulators, and\n•\nMonitoring developments associated with LIBOR alternatives and industry practices related to LIBOR-indexed instruments.\nPNC also has been an active participant in efforts with the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies to explore the potential need for a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to SOFR for use in commercial loans. Those efforts led to the formation of the Credit Sensitive Group, which has held a series of workshops to assess how a credit-sensitive rate or add-on to SOFR might be constructed and discuss associated implementation issues.\nIn addition, in the third quarter of 2020, PNC began offering conforming ARMs using SOFR instead of USD LIBOR in line with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements. Plans are in place to begin offering private student loans and portfolio loans using non-LIBOR rates in the second quarter of 2021. PNC has provided regular updates to Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC examination staff regarding its LIBOR cessation and transition plans.\nMarket Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk\nWe engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.\nWe use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2020 and 2019 were within our acceptable limits.\nTo help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as backtesting. The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the VaR levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day. Our VaR measure assumes that exposures remain constant and that recent market variability is a good predictor of future variability. Actual observations include customer related revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce losses and can reduce the number of instances actual losses exceed the prior day VaR measure. There were minimal instances during 2020 and 2019 under our diversified VaR measure where actual losses exceeded the prior day VaR measure and those losses were insignificant. Our portfolio and enterprise-wide VaR models utilize a historical approach with a 500 day look back period.\nCustomer-related trading revenue was $466 million in 2020 compared with $285 million in 2019 and is recorded in Other noninterest income and Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nThe increase was primarily due to the impact of the changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities and higher derivative client sales revenues.\nMarket Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk\nEquity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in\n84\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\na variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.\nVarious PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.\nA summary of our equity investments follows:\nTable 37: Equity Investments Summary\nTax Credit Investments\nIncluded in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNote 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report has further information on tax credit investments.\nPrivate Equity and Other\nThe majority of our other equity investments consists of our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.5 billion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020, $1.3 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $0.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds.\nSee the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of this Report for discussion of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule on our interests in and of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule.\nIncluded in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation. Based upon the December 31, 2020 per share closing price of $218.73 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the Class B common shares was approximately $1.2 billion at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was not significant. See Note 15 Fair Value and Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding our Visa agreements. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa B common shares given the shares’ limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace.\nWe also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not significant during 2020 and 2019.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily financial in nature and typically have varying maturity dates. Accordingly, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. However, during periods of inflation, there may be a subsequent impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power, and fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services. Should significant levels of inflation occur, our business could potentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit losses resulting from possible increased default rates.\nFinancial Derivatives\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n85\nFinancial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.\nFurther information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 15 Fair Value and Note 16 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nNot all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.\nOperational Risk Management\nOperational risk is the risk to the current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational risk is inherent to the entire organization.\nOperational risk management is embedded in our culture and decision-making processes through a systematic approach whereby operational risks and exposures are: 1) identified and assessed; 2) managed through the design and implementation of controls; 3) measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance limits; and 4) appropriately reported to management and the Risk Committee. Strong operational risk management and well-informed risk-based decisions benefit us by improving the customer experience, enhancing compliance, reducing reputational risk, minimizing losses and establishing an appropriate amount of required operational risk capital held by us.\nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is designed to provide effective and consistent management of operational risk. The primary purpose of the framework is to enable us to understand our operational risks and manage them to the desired risk profile, in line with our Risk Appetite. Additionally, the guidance established within the framework enables management to make well-informed risk-based business decisions.\nThe framework provides a disciplined and structured process for us to manage operational risk across eight operational risk domains. These domains provide a comprehensive view of operational risk and allow us to discuss operational risk in a standard way, facilitating reporting and ongoing risk mitigation.\nThe operational risk domains are:\n•\nOperations: Risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, misconduct or errors of people or fraud.\n•\nCompliance: Risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, self-regulatory standards, or other regulatory requirements.\n•\nData Management: Risk associated with incomplete or inaccurate data.\n•\nModel: Risk associated with the design, implementation, and ongoing use and management of a model.\n•\nTechnology and Systems: Risk associated with the use, operation, and adoption of technology.\n•\nInformation Security: Risk resulting from the failure to protect information and ensure appropriate access to, and use and handling of information assets.\n•\nBusiness Continuity: Risk of potential disruptive events to business activities.\n•\nThird Party: Risk arising from failure of third party providers to conduct activity in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws and regulations.\nWe utilize operational risk management programs within the framework, including Risk Control and Self-Assessments, scenario analysis, and internal and external loss event review and analysis, to assess existing risks, determine potential/emerging risks and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. The program tools and methodology enable our business managers to identify potential risks and control gaps.\nLines of business are responsible for identifying, owning, managing and monitoring the operational risks and controls associated with its business activities and product or service offerings to within acceptable levels. Centralized functions, such as Business Continuity, Enterprise Third Party Management, and Information Security, are responsible for the development, implementation and management of their individual programs and for the development and maintenance of the policies, procedures, methodologies, tools and technology utilized across the enterprise to identify, assess, monitor and report program risks. Additionally, independent risk management reviews and challenges line of business adherence to the framework to ensure proper controls are in place and appropriate risk mitigation plans are established as necessary.\nConduct, Reputational and Strategic Risk\nPNC’s risk culture seeks to reinforce the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior through sound processes and controls. In order to promote a robust risk culture, the Board and executive management establish code of conduct and professional\n86\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nstandards to which all employees must adhere. A strong risk culture discourages misconduct and supports Conduct risk management at PNC. Conduct risk is defined as the risk that employees fail to comply with the ethical standards expected of them. Strong Conduct risk management is important in supporting PNC’s reputation and PNC maintains a corporate culture that emphasizes complying with laws, regulations, and managing reputational risks. Reputational risk is the risk to the franchise and/or shareholder value based on a negative perception of PNC by its stakeholders and/or the changing expectations of its stakeholders. While managing PNC’s reputation preserves PNC’s brand value, Strategic risk is another component of the ERM Framework that is also critical to optimizing shareholder returns. Strategic risk is the risk to earnings that may arise from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions and/or inadequate response to changes in the business environment. Strategic risk is considered and assessed by our businesses in the annual strategic planning processes and monitored on an on-going basis as those plans are carried out.\nCompliance Risk\nEnterprise Compliance is responsible for oversight of compliance risk for the organization. Compliance issues are identified and tracked through enterprise-wide monitoring and testing activities. Compliance risk issues are escalated through a comprehensive risk reporting process at both a business and enterprise level and incorporated, as appropriate, into the development and assessment of our operational risk profile. A management committee, co-chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief BSA/AML Officer, is responsible for oversight of compliance and fiduciary risk management programs across PNC. Enterprise Compliance, through the Regulatory Change Program, helps PNC understand and proactively address emerging regulatory topics and risks as well as respond to changes in applicable laws and regulations. To understand emerging issues impacting the industry, Enterprise Compliance communicates regularly with various regulators having supervisory or regulatory responsibilities with respect to us, our subsidiaries, or businesses and participates in forums focused on regulatory and compliance matters in the financial services industry.\nInformation Security Risk\nThe Information Security component of our Operational Risk Management Framework is responsible for protecting information assets to achieve business objectives, which includes cyber security. PNC’s cyber security program is designed to identify risks to sensitive information, protect that information, detect threats and events, and maintain an appropriate response and recovery capability to help ensure resilience against information security incidents. The program includes, among other things, annual security and privacy training for all PNC employees and quarterly phishing exercises to raise employee awareness. Our security program is also regularly examined by federal regulators for compliance with financial regulations and standards. The program also establishes expectations for information asset management, system development security, identity and access management, incident management, threat and vulnerability management, security operations management, and third and fourth party security.\nC\nRITICAL\nA\nCCOUNTING\nE\nSTIMATES AND\nJ\nUDGMENTS\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes the most significant accounting policies that we use. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions, and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13 -\nCredit Losses,\ncommonly referred to as the CECL standard. The following discussion relates to our ACL, post implementation of CECL. For additional information on our allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit prior to this adoption see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our 2019 Form 10-K.\nWe maintain the ACL at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases (including residual values), other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the remaining contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments. Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these factors to estimate expected credit losses. We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and other methods used to estimate ACL on an ongoing basis. We apply qualitative factors to reflect in the ACL our best estimate of amounts that we do not expect to collect because of, among other things, idiosyncratic risk factors, changes in economic conditions that may not be reflected in forecasted results, or other potential methodology weaknesses. The ACL estimates are therefore susceptible to various factors, including, but not limited to, the following major factors:\n•\nCurrent economic conditions and borrower quality: Our forecast of expected losses depends on conditions and portfolio\nquality as of the estimation date. As current conditions evolve, forecasted losses could be materially affected.\n•\nScenario weights and design: Our loss estimates are sensitive to the shape and severity of macroeconomic forecasts and thus\nvary significantly between upside and downside scenarios. Change to probability weights assigned to these scenarios and\ntiming of peak business cycles reflected by the scenarios could materially affect our loss estimates.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n87\n•\nPortfolio volume and mix: Changes to portfolio volume and mix could materially affect our estimates, as CECL reserves\nwould be recognized upon origination or acquisition.\nFor all assets and unfunded lending related commitments within the scope of the CECL standard, the applicable ACL is composed of one or a combination of the following components: (i) collectively assessed or pooled reserves, (ii) individually assessed reserves, and\n(iii) qualitative (judgmental) reserves. Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nReasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast\nUnder CECL, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses. For this purpose,\nwe have established a framework which includes a three year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes over our reasonable and supportable forecast period. Credit losses estimated in our reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to them.\nTo generate the four economic forecast scenarios we use a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking expert judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight) in order to represent our current expectation within that distribution over the forecast period. This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution and the expert judgment of PNC’s CECL RAC. This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected economic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans and securities. Each quarter the scenarios are presented for approval to PNC’s CECL RAC, and the committee determines and approves CECL scenarios’ weights for use for the current reporting period.\nThe scenarios used for the period ended December 31, 2020 were designed to reflect the economic recovery that began in May, which consistently outpaced market expectations and remained strong through the end of the year, but has begun to show signs of an impending slowdown. We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with the most significant drivers being GDP and unemployment rate measures. Using the weighted-average of our four economic forecast scenarios, we estimated that GDP grew 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020 finishing the year down 2.8% from fourth quarter 2019 levels with 2.3% growth in 2021, recovering to pre-recession peak levels in the first quarter of 2022. The weighted-average unemployment rate was estimated to rise to 7.8% in the first quarter of 2021, with the labor market beginning to recover again in third quarter 2021, and ending 2021 at 6.8%. The unemployment rate was estimated to reach 5.7% and 5.0% by the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively. One of the scenarios included in our weighted-average is our baseline prediction of the most likely economic outcome; which includes estimated GDP recovering to pre-pandemic l\nevels in late 2021 with unemployment not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level until at least 2023. See our Business Outlook and the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in this Item 7 for additional discussion on our baseline prediction of the most likely economic outcome. While the economy saw significant recovery from the onset of the pandemic in national level macroeconomic indicators, considerabl\ne uncertainty remains regarding overall lifetime loss content for both our commercial and consumer portfolios, specifically as it relates to our customers that are less likely to benefit from the economic recovery currently underway. For commercial borrowers, there are substantial concerns around industries that are dependent on in-person gatherings, hospitality and tourism. For consumer borrowers, payment behavior once the CARES Act stimulus wanes is also difficult to predict but we believe the highest uncertainty is concentrated within consumer borrowers who have been afforded accommodation as it relates to payment deferral/forbearance. As such, for both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios, PNC identified and performed significant analysis around these key, highly impacted segments to ensure our reserves were adequate in light of the improved economic environment. We believe that the economic assumptions used in the scenarios for the fourth quarter of 2020, in combination with increased reserves for borrowers in segments most adversely impacted by the pandemic, sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio.\nFor internal analytical purposes, we considered what our capital ratios would be if we had an ACL at December 31, 2020 equal to the Federal Reserve’s estimated nine quarter credit losses for PNC under the 2020 CCAR supervisory severely adverse scenario of $12.1 billion, increasing the reserves by approximately $6.0 billion at year end. This analysis resulted in a CET1 ratio of approximately 10.6% at December 31, 2020, a level well above 7.0%, which is our regulatory minimum of 4.5% plus our SCB of 2.5%. This scenario was not our expectation at December 31, 2020 and does not reflect our current expectation, nor does it capture all the potential unknown variables, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions. The CECL methodology inherently requires a high degree of judgment. As a result, it is possible that we may, at another point in time, reach different conclusions regarding our credit loss estimates.\nResidential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe elect to measure our MSRs at fair value. This election was made to be consistent with our risk management strategy to hedge changes in the fair value of these assets. The fair value of our MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model\n88\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nwhich calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions.\nWe employ risk management strategies designed to protect the value of MSRs from changes in interest rates and related market factors. The values of the MSRs are economically hedged with securities and derivatives, including interest-rate swaps, options, and forward mortgage-backed and futures contracts. As interest rates change, these financial instruments are expected to have changes in fair value negatively correlated to the change in fair value of the hedged MSR portfolios. The hedge relationships are actively managed in response to changing market conditions over the life of the MSRs. Selecting appropriate financial instruments to economically hedge residential or commercial MSRs requires significant management judgment to assess how mortgage rates and prepayment speeds could affect the future values of MSRs. Hedging results can frequently be less predictable in the short term, but over longer periods of time are expected to protect the economic value of the MSRs.\nFor additional information on our residential and commercial MSRs, see Note 1  Accounting Policies, Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 15 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe apply ASC 820 –\nFair Value Measurements\n. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This guidance requires a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable.

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions.\nForward-looking statements are necessarily subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.  Future events or circumstances may change our outlook and may also affect the nature of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties to which our forward-looking statements are subject.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.  We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements.  Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.  As a result, we caution against placing undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.\n▪\nOur businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:\n–\nChanges in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets,\n–\nDisruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets,\n–\nActions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates,\n–\nChanges in customer behavior due to changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives,\n–\nChanges in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness,\n–\nImpacts of tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners,\n–\nThe length and extent of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,\n–\nThe impact of the results of the recent U.S. elections on the regulatory landscape, capital markets, and the response to and management of the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether there will be additional fiscal stimulus from the federal government and, if so, its size, scope and effectiveness, and\n–\nCommodity price volatility.\n▪\nOur forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be\nsubstantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory\ncontingencies. These statements are based on our views that:\n–\nThe U.S. economy is in an economic recovery, following a very severe but very short economic contraction in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures to contain it.\n–\nDespite the improvement in the economy since the spring of 2020, economic activity remains far below its pre-pandemic level and unemployment remains elevated.\n–\nGrowth will be much weaker in early 2021 because of record COVID-19 cases and continued government restrictions of economic activity. Growth should then pick up in the spring of 2021 as vaccines are more widely available and the federal government provides aid to households and small and medium-sized businesses. PNC does not expect real GDP to return to its pre-pandemic level until late 2021, and does not expect employment to return to its pre-pandemic level until at least 2023.\n–\nPNC expects the FOMC to keep the fed funds rate in its current range of 0.00% to 0.25% through at least mid-2024.\n•\nPNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC meeting or exceeding a stress capital buffer established by the Federal Reserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process. The Federal Reserve also has imposed additional limitations on capital distributions through the first quarter of 2021 by CCAR-participating bank holding companies and may extend these limitations, potentially in modified form.\n•\nPNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory review of related models.\n•\nLegal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:\n–\nChanges to laws and regulations, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, bank capital and liquidity standards, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.\n90\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n–\nUnfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC.\n–\nResults of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.\n–\nImpact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.\n•\nBusiness and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.\n•\nOur planned acquisition of BBVA presents us with risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transaction itself and to the integration of the acquired business into PNC after closing:\n–\nThe business of BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, going forward may not perform as we currently project or in a manner consistent with historical performance. As a result, the anticipated benefits, including estimated cost savings, of the transaction may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events, including those that are outside of our control.\n–\nThe combination of BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, with that of PNC and PNC Bank may be more difficult to achieve than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to BBVA, including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, or our existing businesses.\n–\nCompletion of the transaction is dependent on the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, which cannot be assured. The timing of completion of the transaction is dependent on various factors that cannot be predicted with precision at this point.\n•\nI\nn addition to the planned BBVA transaction, we grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.\n•\nCompetition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues.  Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.\n•\nBusiness and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.\nWe provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in this Report, including in Item 1A Risk Factors, the Risk Management section of Item 7, and Note 11 Commitments and  Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC."

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the allowance for credit losses in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n92\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Loans and Lease Losses – Commercial Loans\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loans and lease losses was approximately $5,361 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $3,337 million relates to commercial loans. For commercial loans, the determination of the allowance is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts and other relevant factors. As disclosed by management, the Company has established a framework for developing the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, which includes the use of four economic forecast scenarios and associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes. To generate the four economic forecast scenarios, the Company uses a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking judgment to forecast the distribution of economic outcomes. The economic forecast scenarios which are inputs into the credit loss models, include a number of economic variables with the most significant drivers being GDP and unemployment rate measures. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Company’s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. For example, qualitative factors that the Company considers include industry concentration and conditions, changes in market conditions, recent credit quality trends, model imprecision, the impacts of COVID-19 on highly impacted segments, and other factors.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing economic forecast scenarios, determining weighting of each scenario, and estimating qualitative reserves related to the impacts of COVID-19 on certain highly impacted segments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans, including controls over the development and approval of economic forecast scenarios, related weightings, and qualitative reserves. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness and methodology of certain loss forecasting models (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain borrower risk characteristics, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain forecasted economic variables such as GDP and unemployment measures, (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s weighting of economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (v) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (vi) evaluating certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating certain models, model inputs, economic forecasts, and qualitative reserves in the commercial allowance estimate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 26, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n93\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\nTHE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.\nSee accompanying Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements.\n94\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nTHE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.\nSee accompanying Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n95\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\nTHE PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.\n(a)\nOur consolidated assets included the following for which we have elected the fair value option: Loans held for sale of $\n1.2\nbillion, Loans of $\n1.4\nbillion and Other assets of\n$\n0.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and Loans held for sale of $\n1.1\nbillion, Loans of $\n0.7\nbillion and Other assets of $\n0.1\nbillion at December 31, 2019.\n(b)\nRepresents our held for sale investment in BlackRock.

Our retail branch network is located primarily in markets across the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have strategic international offices in\nfour\ncountries outside the U.S.\nN\nOTE\n1\nA\nCCOUNTING\nP\nOLICIES\nBasis of Financial Statement Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests and variable interest entities.\nWe prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements and the ACL. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations\nA disposal of an asset or business that meets the criteria for held for sale classification is reported as discontinued operations when the disposal represents a strategic shift that has had, or will have a major effect on our operating results. We report an asset as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the asset and is committed to a formal plan, the asset is available for immediate sale, the asset is being actively marketed, the sale is anticipated to occur during the ensuing year and certain other specified criteria are met. An asset classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the asset is written down to its fair value upon the held for sale designation. Our BlackRock held for sale asset is recorded at its carrying amount as we accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting and the fair value of the asset exceeded the carrying value at each balance sheet date.\nWhen presenting discontinued operations, assets classified as held for sale are segregated in the Consolidated Balance Sheet commencing in the period in which the asset meets all of the held for sale criteria described above and prior periods are recast. The results of discontinued operations are reported in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Income Statement for current and prior periods commencing in the period in which the asset or business is either disposed of or is classified as held for sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the sale or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell.\n100\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n101\nThe following table presents the impact of adopting the CECL standard on January 1, 2020 on our allowance and retained earnings.\nTable 38: Impact of the CECL Standard Adoption\n(a)\nTransition adjustment includes the increase in the total ACL of $\n0.7\nbillion and the impact of the fair value option election of $\n0.2\nbillion, offset by the tax impact of $\n0.2\nbillion.\n102\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash and cash equivalents\nfor financial reporting purposes because they represent a primary source of liquidity. Certain cash balances within Cash and due from banks on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\nInvestments\nWe hold interests in various types of investments. The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, items such as:\n•\nOwnership interest,\n•\nOur plans for the investment, and\n•\nThe nature of the investment.\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. We classify debt securities as either trading, held to maturity, or available for sale. Debt securities that we purchase for certain risk management activities or customer-related trading activities are classified as trading securities, are reported in the Other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in Other noninterest income. We classify debt securities as held to maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity, and carry them at amortized cost, less any allowance. Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or trading are classified as securities available for sale, and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in AOCI net of income taxes.\nWe include all interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on investment securities, in net interest income using the constant effective yield method generally calculated over the contractual lives of the securities. Effective yields reflect either the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition or, for debt securities where an OTTI was recorded, the effective interest rate determined based on improved cash flows subsequent to an impairment. We compute gains and losses realized on the sale of available for sale debt securities on a specific security basis. These securities gains/(losses) are included in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nAs discussed in the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards section of this Note 1, we adopted the CECL standard as of January 1,\n2020, which requires expected credit losses on both held to maturity and available for sale securities to be recognized through a\nvaluation allowance, ACL, instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. An available for sale security is considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit, the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit, limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security. If we have the intent to sell or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell an impaired available for sale security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis. Credit losses on investment securities are recognized through the Provision for credit losses on our Consolidated Income Statement. Declines in the fair value of available for sale securities that are not considered credit related are recognized in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The CECL standard is applied prospectively to debt securities and, as a result, the amortized cost basis of investment securities for which OTTI had previously been recorded did not change upon adoption.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, we reviewed all debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position for OTTI. An investment security was deemed impaired if the fair value of the investment was less than its amortized cost. After an investment security was determined to be impaired, we evaluated whether the decline in value was other-than-temporary. Declines in the fair value of debt securities that were deemed other-than-temporary and were attributable to credit deterioration were recognized in Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which the determination was made. Declines in fair value which were deemed other-than-temporary and attributable to factors other than credit deterioration were recognized in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe consider a security to be past due in terms of payment based on its contractual terms. A security may be placed on nonaccrual, with interest no longer recognized until received, when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful. As of December 31, 2020, nonaccrual or past due held-to-maturity securities were immaterial.\nA security may be partially or fully charged off against the allowance if it is determined to be uncollectible, including, for an available for sale security, if we have the intent to sell or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Recoveries of previously charged-off available for sale securities are recognized when received, while recoveries on held to maturity securities are recognized when expected.\nSee the Allowance for Credit Losses section of this Note 1 for further discussion regarding the methodologies used to determine the\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n103\nallowance for investment securities. See Note 3 Investment Securities for additional information about the investment securities portfolio and the related ACL.\nEquity Securities and Partnership Interests\nWe account for equity securities, equity investments, private equity investments, and investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other investments that are not required to be consolidated under one of the following methods:\n•\nWe use the equity method for general and limited partner ownership interests and limited liability companies in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Under the equity method, we record our equity ownership share of net income or loss of the investee in Noninterest income and any dividends received on equity method investments are recorded as a reduction to the investment balance. When an equity investment experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value, we may be required to record a loss on the investment.\n•\nWe measure equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value at fair value through Net income. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in Noninterest income. Dividend income on these equity securities is included in Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.\n•\nWe generally use the practicability exception to fair value measurement for all other investments without a readily determinable fair value. When we elect this alternative measurement method, the investment is recorded at cost and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus changes in value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same issuer. These investments are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates impairment and the fair value is less than the carrying value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in Noninterest income. Distributions received on these investments are included in Noninterest income.\nInvestments described above are included in Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nPrivate Equity Investments\nWe report private equity investments, which include direct investments in companies, affiliated partnership interests and indirect investments in private equity funds, at estimated fair value. These estimates are based on available information and may not necessarily represent amounts that we will ultimately realize through distribution, sale or liquidation of the investments. Fair values of publicly-traded direct investments are determined using quoted market prices and are subject to various discount factors arising from security level restrictions, when appropriate. The valuation procedures applied to direct investments and indirect investments are detailed in Note 15 Fair Value. We include all private equity investments within Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in fair value of private equity investments are recognized in Other noninterest income.\nWe consolidate affiliated partnerships when we have determined that we have control of the partnership or are the primary beneficiary if the entity is a VIE. The portion we do not own is reflected in Noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLoans\nLoans are classified as held for investment when management has both the intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. Management’s intent and view of the foreseeable future may change based on changes in business strategies, the economic environment, market conditions and the availability of government programs.\nMeasurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. See Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information on how COVID-19 hardship related loan modifications are reported from a delinquency perspective as of December 31, 2020.\nLoans held for investment, excluding PCD loans, are recorded at amortized cost basis unless we elect to measure these under the fair value option. Amortized cost basis represents principal amounts outstanding, net of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, premiums or discounts on purchased loans and charge-offs. Amortized cost basis does not include accrued interest, as we include accrued interest in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest on performing loans is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and recorded in Interest income as earned using the constant effective yield method. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, and loan premiums and discounts are deferred and accreted or amortized into Net interest income using the constant effective yield method, over the contractual life of the loan. The processing fee received for loans originated through PPP lending under the CARES Act is deferred and accreted into Net interest income using the effective yield method, over the contractual life of the loan. Loans under the fair value option are reported at their fair value, with any changes to fair value reported as Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement, and are excluded from measurement of ALLL.\nIn addition to originating loans, we also acquire loans through the secondary loan market, portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies. Certain acquired loans that have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination (i.e., PCD) are recognized at an amortized cost basis equal to their purchase price plus an ALLL measured at the\n104\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nacquisition date. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality are recognized through a charge to the provision for credit losses resulting in an increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows are recognized as a provision recapture of previously recorded ALLL\n.\nWe consider a loan to be collateral dependent when we determine that substantially all of the expected cash flows will be generated\nfrom the operation or sale of the collateral underlying the loan, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we have elected to\nmeasure the loan at the estimated fair value of collateral (less costs to sell if sale or foreclosure of the property is expected).\nAdditionally, we consider a loan to be collateral dependent when foreclosure or liquidation of the underlying collateral is probable.\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. A concession has been granted when we do not expect to collect all amounts due, including original interest accrued at the original contract rate, as a result of the restructuring, or there is a delay in payment that is more than insignificant. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities, and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization, and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us. In those situations where principal is forgiven, the amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off.\nPotential incremental losses or recoveries on TDRs have been factored into the ALLL estimates for each loan class under the methodologies described in this Note. Once a loan becomes a TDR, it will continue to be reported as a TDR until it is ultimately repaid in full, the collateral is foreclosed upon or it is fully charged off.\nPNC excludes consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and certain government insured or guaranteed loans from our TDR population. PCD loans do not require additional considerations and thus are evaluated for inclusion in our TDR population. In addition, PNC has elected not to apply a TDR designation to loans that have been restructured due to a COVID-19 hardship pursuant to specific criteria under the CARES Act. Since loans restructured due to a COVID-19 related hardship were not identified as TDRs, they are not placed on nonaccrual at the time of modification unless payment in full of principal or interest is not expected. These loans continue to be subject to our existing nonaccrual policy.\nSee the following for additional information related to loans, including further discussion regarding our policies, the methodologies and significant inputs used to determine the ALLL and additional details on the composition of our loan portfolio:\n•\nNonperforming Loans and Leases section of this Note 1,\n•\nAllowance for Credit Losses section of this Note 1, and\n•\nNote 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n105\nNonperforming Loans and Leases\nThe matrix that follows summarizes our policies for classifying certain loans as nonperforming loans and/or discontinuing the accrual of loan interest income.\nCommercial\nWe generally charge-off commercial (commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and equipment lease financing) nonperforming loans when we determine that a specific loan, or portion thereof, is uncollectible. This determination is based on the specific facts and circumstances of the individual loans. In making this determination, we consider the viability of the business or project as a going concern, the past due status when the asset is not well-secured, the expected cash flows to repay the loan, the value of the collateral and the ability and willingness of any guarantors to perform.\nAdditionally, in general, for smaller commercial loans of $100,000 or less, a full charge-off occurs at\n180\ndays past due for term loans and revolvers. For smaller commercial leases of $1 million or less, a full charge-off occurs at\n120\ndays past due. Small business credit card balances are charged-off at\n180\ndays past due.\nConsumer\nWe generally charge-off secured consumer (home equity, residential real estate and automobile) nonperforming loans to the fair\nvalue of collateral less costs to sell, if lower than the amortized cost basis of the loan outstanding, when delinquency of the loan, combined with other risk factors (e.g., bankruptcy, lien position or troubled debt restructuring), indicates that the loan, or some portion thereof, is uncollectible as per our historical experience, or the collateral has been repossessed. We charge-off secured consumer loans no later than\n180\ndays past due. Most consumer loans and lines of credit, not secured by automobiles or residential real estate, are charged-off once they have reached\n120\n-\n180\ndays past due.\n106\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nFor secured collateral dependent loans, collateral values are updated at least annually and subsequent declines in collateral values are charged-off resulting in incremental provision for credit loss. Subsequent increases in collateral values may be reflected as an adjustment to the ALLL to reflect the expectation of recoveries in an amount greater than previously expected, limited to amounts previously charged-off.\nAccounting for Nonperforming Assets and Leases and Other Nonaccrual Loans\nFor nonaccrual loans, interest income accrual and deferred fee/cost recognition is discontinued. Additionally, the current year accrued and uncollected interest is reversed through Net interest income and prior year accrued and uncollected interest is charged-off, except for credit cards, where we reverse any accrued interest through Net interest income at the time of charge-off, as per industry standard practice. Nonaccrual loans that are also collateral dependent may be charged-off to reduce the basis to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell.\nIf payment is received on a nonaccrual loan, generally the payment is first applied to the remaining principal balance; payments are then applied to recover any charged-off amounts related to the loan. Finally, if both principal balance and any charge-offs have been recovered, then the payment will be recorded as fee and interest income. For certain consumer loans, the receipt of interest payments is recognized as interest income on a cash basis. Cash basis income recognition is applied if a loan’s amortized cost basis is deemed fully collectible and the loan has performed for at least six months.\nFor TDRs, payments are applied based upon their contractual terms unless the related loan is deemed non-performing. TDRs are generally included in nonperforming and nonaccrual loans. However, after a reasonable period of time, generally six months, in which the loan performs under restructured terms and meets other performance indicators, it is returned to performing/accruing status. This return to performing/accruing status demonstrates that the bank expects to collect all of the loan’s remaining contractual principal and interest. TDRs resulting from (i) borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us, and (ii) borrowers that are not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.\nOther nonaccrual loans are generally not returned to accrual status until the borrower has performed in accordance with the contractual terms and other performance indicators for at least six months, the period of time which was determined to demonstrate the expected collection of the loan’s remaining contractual principal and interest. Nonaccrual loans with partially charged-off principal are not returned to accrual. When a nonperforming loan is returned to accrual status, it is then considered a performing loan.\nForeclosed assets consist of any asset seized or property acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. OREO comprises principally commercial and residential real estate properties obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. After obtaining a foreclosure judgment, or in some jurisdictions the initiation of proceedings under a power of sale in the loan instruments, the property will be sold. When we are awarded title or completion of deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, we transfer the loan to foreclosed assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is initially recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell. Based upon the estimated fair value less cost to sell, the amortized cost basis of the loan is adjusted and a charge-off/recovery is recognized to the ALLL. We estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals, or sales agreements with third parties. Subsequently, foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition date or estimated fair value less cost to sell. Valuation adjustments on these assets and gains or losses realized from disposition of such property are reflected in Other noninterest expense.\nFor certain mortgage loans that have a government guarantee, we establish a separate other receivable upon foreclosure. The receivable is measured based on the loan balance (inclusive of principal and interest) that is expected to be recovered from the guarantor.\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses in this Report for additional information on nonperforming assets, TDRs and credit quality indicators related to our loan portfolio.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nOur ACL, in accordance with the CECL standard, is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions and other relevant factors. We maintain the ACL at an\nappropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases (including residual values), other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for the estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures as of the balance sheet date. The remaining contractual term of assets in scope of CECL is estimated considering contractual maturity dates, prepayment expectations, utilization or draw expectations and any embedded extension options that do not allow us to unilaterally cancel the extension options. For products without a fixed contractual maturity date (\ne.g\n., credit cards), we rely on historical payment behavior to determine the length of the paydown or default time period.\nWe estimate expected losses on a pooled basis using a combination of (i) the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) a period of reversion to long run average expected losses where applicable and (iii) the long run average expected\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n107\nlosses for the remaining estimated contractual term. For all assets and unfunded lending related commitments in the scope of CECL, the ACL also includes individually assessed reserves and qualitative reserves, as applicable.\nWe use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period. For this purpose, we use forecasted scenarios produced by PNC’s Economics Team, which are designed to reflect business cycles and their related estimated probabilities. The forecast length that we have determined to be reasonable and supportable is three years. As noted in the methodology discussions that follow, forward-looking information is incorporated into the expected credit loss estimates. Such forward looking information includes forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, which are estimated using quantitative techniques, analysis from PNC economists and management judgment.\nThe reversion period is used to bridge our three year reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long run average expected credit losses. We may consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such as contractual maturity of the asset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the long run average period. The reversion period is typically 1-3 years, if not immediate.\nThe long run average expected credit losses are derived from long run historical credit loss information adjusted for the credit quality of the current portfolio, and therefore do not consider current and forecasted economic conditions.\nSee the following sections related to investment securities, loans, trade receivables, other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments for details about specific methodologies.\nAllowance for Investment Securities\nA significant portion of our investment securities are issued or guaranteed by either the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury or GNMA) or a government-sponsored agency (FNMA or FHLMC). Taking into consideration historical information and current and forecasted conditions, we do not expect to incur any credit losses on these securities.\nInvestment securities that are not issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or a government-sponsored agency consist of both securitized products, such as non-agency mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as non-securitized products, such as corporate and municipal debt securities. A discounted cash flow approach is primarily used to determine the amount of the allowance required. The estimates of expected cash flows are determined using macroeconomic sensitive models taking into consideration the reasonable and supportable forecast period and scenarios discussed above. Additional factors unique to a specific security may also be taken into consideration when estimating expected cash flows. The cash flows expected to be collected, after considering expected prepayments, are discounted at the effective interest rate. For an available-for-sale security, the amount of the allowance is limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its estimated fair value.\nSee Note 3 Investment Securities in this Report for additional information about the investment securities portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected loss methodology is based upon the quantification of risk parameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan or loan segment. We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on contractual maturity in our expected loss estimates. We use historical credit loss information, current borrower risk characteristics and forecasted economic variables for the reasonable and supportable forecast period, coupled with analytical methods, to estimate these risk parameters by loan or loan segments. PD, LGD and EAD parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the long run average period, and combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario. The following matrix provides key credit risk characteristics that we use to estimate these risk parameters.\n108\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n109\nThe following matrix describes the key economic variables that are consumed during our forecast period by loan class, as well as other assumptions that are used for our reversion and long run average approaches.\nAfter the forecast period, we revert to the long run average over the reversion period noted above, which is the period between the end of the forecast period and when losses are estimated to have completely reverted to the long run average.\nOnce we have developed a combined estimate of credit losses (\ni.e.\n, for the forecast period, reversion period and long run average) under each of the forecasted scenarios, we produce a probability-weighted credit loss estimate by loan class. We then add or deduct any qualitative components and other adjustments, such as individually assessed loans, to produce the ALLL. See the Individually Assessed Component and Qualitative Component discussions that follow in this Note 1 for additional information about those adjustments.\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nIn addition to TDRs, we also use a discounted cash flow methodology for our home equity and residential real estate loan classes. We determine effective interest rates considering contractual cash flows adjusted for estimated prepayments. Changes in the ALLL due to the impact of the passage of time under the discounted cash flow estimate are recognized through the provision for credit losses.\nIndividually Assessed Component\nLoans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans are individually assessed as follows:\n•\nFor commercial nonperforming loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, reserves are based on an analysis of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for collateral dependent loans. Nonperforming commercial loans below the defined threshold, and accruing TDRs are reserved for under a pooled basis.\n•\nFor consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts previously charged-off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.\nQualitative Component\nWhile our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant credit risk factors, there continues to be uncertainty associated with, but not limited to, potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between expected and actual outcomes. We may hold additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks. The ACL also takes into account factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individually assessed or pooled reserves. Such qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to:\n110\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n•\nIndustry concentrations and conditions, including the impacts of COVID-19 on highly impacted segments,\n•\nChanges in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements,\n•\nChanges in the nature and volume of our portfolio,\n•\nRecent credit quality trends, including the impact of COVID-19 hardship related loan modifications,\n•\nRecent loss experience in particular portfolios, including specific and unique events,\n•\nRecent macro-economic factors that may not be reflected in the forecast information,\n•\nLimitations of available input data, including historical loss information and recent data such as collateral values,\n•\nModel imprecision and limitations,\n•\nChanges in lending policies and procedures, including changes in loss recognition and mitigation policies and procedures,\n•\nTiming of available information, including the performance of first lien positions.\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information about our loan portfolio and the related allowance.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses (Incurred Loss Methodology)\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, we maintained the ALLL at a level that we believed to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios as of the balance sheet date. These evaluations were inherently subjective, as they required material estimates, and included, among others: PD, LGD, EAD, movement through delinquency stages, amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, value of collateral and qualitative factors.\nFor all loans and leases, except purchased impaired loans, the ALLL was the sum of three components:\n•\nAsset specific/individual impaired reserves: Nonperforming loans that were considered impaired under ASC 310 –\nReceivables\n, which included all commercial and consumer TDRs, were evaluated for specific reserves.\n•\nQuantitative (formulaic or pooled) reserves: Quantitative reserves in the commercial portfolio were determined through quantitative loss modeling utilizing PD, LGD, and the outstanding balance of the loan, while quantitative reserves in the consumer portfolio were determined primarily using transition matrices, including a roll-rate model.\n•\nQualitative (judgmental) reserves.\nThe reserve calculation and determination process was dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes reacted to and were influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrowers and economic conditions.\nAccrued Interest\nWhen accrued interest is reversed or charged-off in a timely manner, the CECL standard provides a practical expedient to exclude\naccrued interest from ACL measurement. We consider our nonaccrual and charge-off policies to be timely for all of our investment\nsecurities, loans and leases, with the exception of consumer credit cards, education loans and certain unsecured consumer lines of credit. We consider the length of time before nonaccrual/charge-off and the use of appropriate other triggering events for nonaccrual and charge-offs in making this determination. Pursuant to these policy elections, we calculate reserves for accrued interest on credit cards, education loans and certain unsecured consumer lines of credit, which are then included within the ALLL. See the Debt Securities and Nonperforming Loans and Leases sections of this Note 1 for additional information on our nonaccrual and charge-off policies.\nAdditionally, pursuant to our use of a discounted cash flow methodology in estimating credit losses for our home equity and residential real estate loan classes, applicable reserves for accrued interest are also included within the ALLL for these loan classes\n.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans or Securities\nThe allowance for PCD loans or securities is determined at the time of acquisition (including January 1, 2020 when certain purchased impaired loans were grandfathered and transitioned to PCD upon adoption of CECL), as the estimated expected credit loss of the outstanding balance or par value,\nbased on the methodologies described previously for loans and securities. In accordance with CECL, the allowance recognized at acquisition is added to the acquisition date purchase price to determine the asset’s amortized cost basis.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, acquired purchased impaired loans were recorded at fair value. When evidence of credit quality deterioration and evidence that it was probable that we would be unable to collect all contractual amounts due existed, we considered the loans to be purchased credit impaired and we estimated the amount and timing of undiscounted expected cash flows at acquisition for each loan either individually or on a pool basis. The excess of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over its carrying value represented the accretable yield which was recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan (or pool of loans) using the constant effective yield method. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows that were attributable to credit quality were recognized as impairments resulting in an increase in the ALLL. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows were recognized as a provision recapture of previously recorded ALLL or prospectively through an adjustment of the loan’s or pool’s yield over its remaining life.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n111\nAllowance for Unfunded Lending Related Commitments\nWe maintain the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments on off-balance sheet credit exposures that are not unconditionally cancelable (e.g., unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit and certain financial guarantees), at a level we believe is appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb expected credit losses on these exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this reserve is estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for loans and leases. See the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses section of this Note 1 for the key credit risk characteristics for unfunded lending related commitments. The allowance for unfunded lending related commitments is recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to this reserve are included in the provision for credit losses.\nSee Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses for additional information about this allowance.\nPrior to the adoption of CECL, we maintained the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believed was appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date. We determined the allowance based on periodic evaluations of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of the probability of commitment usage, credit risk factors, and, solely for commercial lending, the terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments was estimated in a manner similar to the methodology used for determining reserves for funded exposures. The allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit was recorded as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Net adjustments to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit were included in the provision for credit losses.\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets\nWe determine the allowance for other financial assets (e.g., trade receivables, servicing advances on PNC-owned loans, balances with banks) considering historical loss information and other available indicators. In certain cases where there are no historical, current or forecast indicators of an expected credit loss, we may estimate the reserve to be close to zero. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for other financial assets was immaterial.\nLoans Held for Sale\nWe designate loans as held for sale when we have the intent and ability to sell them. At the time of designation to held for sale, any allowance is reversed, and a valuation allowance for the shortfall between the amortized cost basis and the net realizable value is recognized, excluding the amounts already charged off. Similarly, when loans are no longer considered held for sale, the valuation allowance (net of writedowns) is reversed, and an allowance for credit losses is established, excluding the amounts already charged-off. Write-downs on these loans (if required) are recorded as charge-offs through the valuation allowance. Adjustments to the valuation allowance on held for sale loans are recognized in Other noninterest income.\nWe have elected to account for certain commercial and residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. The changes in the fair value of the commercial mortgage loans are measured and recorded in Other noninterest income while such changes for the residential mortgage loans are measured and recorded in Residential mortgage noninterest income each period. See Note 15 Fair Value for additional information.\nInterest income with respect to loans held for sale is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and the loan’s contractual interest rate.\nIn certain circumstances, loans designated as held for sale may be transferred to held for investment based on a change in strategy. We transfer these loans at the lower of cost or estimated fair value; however, any loans originated or purchased for the held for sale portfolio and for which the fair value option has been elected remain at fair value for the life of the loan.\nLoan Sales, Loan Securitizations and Retained Interests\nWe recognize the sale of loans or other financial assets when the transferred assets are legally isolated from our creditors and the appropriate accounting criteria are met. We have sold mortgage and other loans through securitization transactions. In a securitization, financial assets are transferred into trusts or to SPEs in transactions to effectively legally isolate the assets from us.\nIn a securitization, the trust or SPE issues beneficial interests in the form of senior and subordinated securities backed or collateralized by the assets sold to the trust. The senior classes of the asset-backed securities typically receive investment grade credit ratings at the time of issuance. These ratings are generally achieved through the creation of lower-rated subordinated classes of asset-backed securities, as well as subordinated or residual interests. In certain cases, we may retain a portion or all of the securities issued, interest-only strips, one or more subordinated tranches, servicing rights and, in some cases, cash reserve accounts. Securitized loans are removed from the balance sheet and a net gain or loss is recognized in Noninterest income at the time of initial sale. Gains or losses recognized on the sale of the loans depend on the fair value of the loans sold and the retained interests at the date of sale. We generally estimate the fair value of the retained interests based on the present value of future expected cash flows using assumptions as to discount rates, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit losses and servicing costs, if applicable.\n112\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nWith the exception of loan sales to certain U.S. government-chartered entities, our loan sales and securitizations are generally structured without recourse to us except for representations and warranties and with no restrictions on the retained interests. We originate, sell and service commercial mortgage loans under the FNMA DUS program. Under the provisions of the DUS program, we participate in a loss-sharing arrangement with FNMA. When we are obligated for loss-sharing or recourse, our policy is to record such liabilities initially at fair value and subsequently reserve for estimated losses in accordance with guidance contained in applicable GAAP.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets generally that either:\n•\nDoes not have equity investors with voting rights that can directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity’s most significant economic activities through those voting rights or similar rights, or\n•\nHas equity investors that do not provide sufficient equity for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.\nA VIE often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property.\nVIEs are assessed for consolidation under ASC 810 –\nConsolidation\nwhen we hold a variable interest in these entities. We consolidate a VIE if we are its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Upon consolidation of a VIE, we recognize all of the VIE’s assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On a quarterly basis, we determine whether any changes occurred requiring a reassessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of an entity.\nSee Note 5 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities for information about VIEs that we consolidate as well as those that we do not consolidate but in which we hold a significant variable interest.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe provide servicing under various loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential loans. These contracts are either purchased in the open market or retained as part of a loan securitization or loan sale. All acquired or originated servicing rights are measured at fair value. Fair value is based on the present value of the expected future net cash flows, including assumptions as to:\n•\nDeposit balances and interest rates for escrow and commercial reserve earnings,\n•\nDiscount rates,\n•\nEstimated prepayment speeds, and\n•\nEstimated servicing costs.\nWe measure commercial and residential MSRs at fair value in order to reduce any potential measurement mismatch between our economic hedges and the MSRs. We manage the risk by hedging the fair value of MSRs with derivatives and securities which are expected to increase in value when the value of the servicing right declines. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recognized as gains/(losses). The fair value of these servicing rights is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions. See Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. At least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date, management performs the goodwill impairment test at a reporting unit level.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n113\nPNC may first perform a qualitative analysis to evaluate whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after considering all relevant events and circumstances, PNC determines it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If PNC elects to bypass the qualitative analysis, or concludes via qualitative analysis that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. Inputs are generated and used in calculating the fair value of the reporting unit, which is compared to its carrying amount. The fair value of our reporting units is determined by using discounted cash flows and/or market comparability methodologies. If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  See Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for additional information.\nLeases\nLessor Arrangements\nWe provide financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft, energy and power systems and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. Finance leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased equipment, less unearned income. Leveraged leases, a form of financing leases, are carried net of nonrecourse debt. We recognize income over the term of the lease using the constant effective yield method. Lease residual values are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are included in Other noninterest income. Valuation adjustments on operating lease residuals are included in Other noninterest expense while valuation adjustments on the net investment of a direct financing or sales-type lease are included in Provision for credit losses. Prior to the adoption of CECL, valuation adjustments on lease residuals were included in Other noninterest expense.\nLessee Arrangements\nWe lease retail branches, datacenters, office space, land and equipment under operating and finance leases. At adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and nonlease components of existing real estate leases and leases of advertising assets, such as signage, as a single lease component. Effective January 1, 2019, lease and nonlease components of new lease agreements are accounted for separately. Lease components consist of fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs and nonlease components consist of common-area maintenance costs. In addition, we elected the practical expedient to not apply the recognition requirements under the standard to short-term leases.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nGenerally, we have elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to the term of the lease at the lease measurement date as our incremental borrowing rate to measure the right-of-use-asset and lease liability.\nSee Note 7 Leases for additional information on our leasing arrangements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFor financial reporting purposes, we depreciate premises and equipment, net of salvage value, principally using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\nWe use estimated useful lives for furniture and equipment ranging from\none\nto\n10\nyears, and depreciate buildings over an estimated useful life of up to\n40\nyears. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives of up to\n15\nyears or the respective lease terms, whichever is shorter.\nWe purchase, as well as internally develop and customize, certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions. Software development costs incurred in the planning and post-development project stages are charged to Noninterest expense. Costs associated with designing software configuration and interfaces, installation, coding programs and testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from\none\nto\n10\nyears.\nWe review the remaining useful lives and carrying values of premises and equipment to determine whether an event has occurred that would indicate a change in useful life is warranted or if any impairment exists.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nOther comprehensive income, on an after-tax basis, primarily consists of unrealized gains or losses on debt securities, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and changes in pension and other postretirement benefit plan liability adjustments. Details of each component are included in Note 13 Other Comprehensive Income.\n114\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nTreasury Stock\nWe record common stock purchased for treasury at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on the first-in, first-out basis.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated using the two-class method to determine income attributable to common shareholders. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities under the two-class method. Distributed dividends and dividend equivalents related to participating securities and an allocation of undistributed net income to participating securities reduce the amount of income attributable to common shareholders. In a period with a loss, no allocation will be made to the participating securities, as they do not have a contractual obligation to absorb losses. Income attributable to common shareholders is then divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period.\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated under the more dilutive of either the treasury method or the two-class method. For the diluted calculation, we increase the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding by the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and warrants and the issuance of incentive shares using the treasury stock method. These adjustments to the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding are made only when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. For periods in which there is a loss from continuing operations, any potential dilutive shares will be anti-dilutive. In this scenario, no potential dilutive shares will be included in the continuing operations, discontinued operations or total earnings per common share calculations, even if overall net income is reported. See Note 14 Earnings Per Share for additional information.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments and the methods and assumptions used in estimating fair value amounts and financial assets and liabilities for which fair value was elected are detailed in Note 15 Fair Value.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risks inherent in our business activities, as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities. We manage these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related cash flows in the Operating Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the determination of fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a cash flow or net investment hedging relationship. For all other derivatives, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nWe utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to return, or general rights to reclaim, cash collateral against the fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized.\nFor those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, we designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.\nWe formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy, before undertaking an accounting hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at inception of the hedge relationship. In addition, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. For accounting hedge relationships, we formally assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. We assess effectiveness using statistical regression analysis. Where the critical terms of the derivative and hedged item match, effectiveness may be assessed qualitatively.\nFor derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges (\ni.e\n., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in LIBOR), changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in earnings the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n115\nthe extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value of the hedged item, the difference is reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same income statement line as the hedged item.\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (\ni.e\n., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the gain or loss on derivatives is reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to income in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect earnings and recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss on the derivatives is reported as a component of AOCI.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or the derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period.\nWe purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. For financial instruments not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, we assess, at inception of the transaction, if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative. If the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and meets the definition of a derivative, the embedded derivative is recorded separately from the host contract with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, unless we elect to account for the hybrid instrument at fair value.\nWe enter into commitments to originate residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale. We also enter into commitments to purchase or sell commercial and residential real estate loans. These commitments are accounted for as free-standing derivatives which are recorded at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss from the change in fair value after the inception of the commitment is recognized in Noninterest income.\nSee Note 16 Financial Derivatives for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse. Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment. Thus, at the enactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured and the change is recognized in Income Tax expense. The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets. Realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets, assuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income. We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based upon all available positive and negative evidence.\nWe use the deferral method of accounting on investments that generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:\n•\nLending,\n•\nSecurities portfolio,\n•\nAsset management,\n•\nLoan sales, loan securitizations, and servicing,\n•\nBrokerage services,\n•\nSale of loans and securities,\n•\nCertain private equity activities, and\n•\nSecurities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities.\nIn addition, we earn fees and commissions from:\n•\nIssuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees,\n•\nDeposit account services,\n•\nMerchant services,\n•\nSelling various insurance products,\n•\nProviding treasury management services,\n•\nProviding merger and acquisition advisory and related services,\n•\nDebit and credit card transactions, and\n•\nParticipating in certain capital markets transactions.\n116\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nService charges on deposit accounts are recognized when earned. Brokerage fees and gains and losses on the sale of securities and certain derivatives are recognized on a trade-date basis.\nWe record private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying investments or when we dispose of our interest.\nWe recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments where we have elected the fair value option. These financial instruments include certain commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale, certain residential mortgage portfolio loans and resale agreements. We also recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of residential and commercial MSRs.\nWe recognize revenue from servicing residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans for others as earned based on the specific contractual terms. These revenues are reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Consumer services. We recognize revenue from securities, derivatives and foreign exchange customer-related trading, as well as securities underwriting activities, as these transactions occur or as services are provided. We generally recognize gains from the sale of loans upon meeting the derecognition criteria for transfers of financial assets. Mortgage revenue recognized is reported net of mortgage repurchase reserves.\nFor the fee-based revenue within the scope of ASC 606 -\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, revenue is recognized when or as those services are transferred to the customer. See Note 24 Fee-Based Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information related to revenue within the scope of ASC 606.\nN\nOTE\n2\nA\nCQUISITION\nA\nND\nD\nIVESTITURE\nA\nCTIVITY\nPending Acquisition of BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc.\nOn November 16, 2020, we announced a definitive agreement with BBVA, S.A. to acquire BBVA including its U.S. banking subsidiary, BBVA USA, for a fixed purchase price of $\n11.6\nbillion in cash.\nBBVA USA has over 600 branches in Texas, Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico. The transaction is expected to add approximately $\n102\nbillion in total assets, $\n86\nbillion of deposits and $\n66\nbillion of loans to PNC’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and to close in mid-2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals.\nSale of Equity Investment in Blackrock, Inc.\nIn May 2020, PNC completed the sale of its\n31.6\nmillion shares of BlackRock, Inc., common and preferred stock through a registered secondary offering at a price of $\n420\nper share. In addition, BlackRock repurchased\n2.65\nmillion shares from PNC at a price of $\n414.96\nper share. The total proceeds from the sale were $\n14.2\nbillion in cash, net of $\n0.2\nbillion in expenses, and resulted in a gain on sale of $\n4.3\nbillion. Additionally, PNC contributed\n500,000\nBlackRock shares to the PNC Foundation.\nFollowing the sale and donation, PNC has divested its entire investment in BlackRock and only holds shares of BlackRock stock in a fiduciary capacity for clients of PNC.\nThe following table summarizes the results from the discontinued operations of BlackRock included in the Consolidated Income Statement:\nTable 39: Consolidated Income Statement - Discontinued Operations\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n117\nThe following table summarizes the cash flows of discontinued operations of BlackRock included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:\nTable 40: Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows - Discontinued Operations\nN\nOTE\n3\nI\nNVESTMENT\nS\nECURITIES\nWith the adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2020, credit losses on investment securities are required to be recognized\nthrough an allowance, instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security. The amortized cost basis of\ninvestment securities for which impairment had previously been recorded did not change upon adoption.\nWe maintain the allowance for investment securities at levels that we believe to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date to absorb\nexpected credit losses on our portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for investment securities was $\n82\nmillion and\nprimarily related to non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in the available for sale portfolio and other debt securities in\nthe held to maturity portfolio. The provision for credit losses on investment securities totaled $\n80\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, upon the adoption of ASU 2019-04, we elected to transfer debt securities with an amortized cost of $\n16.2\nbillion and a fair value of $\n16.5\nbillion from the held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio. During the second quarter of 2020, pursuant to the guidance in ASU 2020-04, we elected to transfer debt securities with an amortized cost of $\n49\nmillion and a fair value of $\n48\nmillion from the held to maturity to the available for sale portfolio.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of the CECL standard, including the methodologies\nused to determine the allowance for investment securities, and the adoption of ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2020-04.\n118\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table summarizes our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios by major security type:\nTable 41: Investment Securities Summary\n(a)   The accrued interest associated with our available for sale and held to maturity portfolios totaled $\n238\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion at December 31, 2020, respectively. These amounts are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)  Amortized cost is presented net of allowance of $\n79\nmillion for securities available for sale and $\n3\nmillion for securities held to maturity at December 31, 2020 in accordance with the CECL accounting standard. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional detail on the CECL accounting standard.\n(c) Credit ratings represent a primary credit quality indicator used to monitor and manage credit risk. As of December 31, 2020,\n85\n% of our securities held to maturity were rated AAA/AA.\nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses included in Shareholders’ equity as AOCI, unless credit related. Net unrealized gains and losses are determined by taking the difference between the fair value of a security and its amortized cost, net of any allowance. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost less any allowance. Investment securities at December 31, 2020 included $\n0.2\nbillion of net unsettled purchases which represent non-cash investing activity, and accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The comparable amount for December 31, 2019 was $\n0.5\nbillion.\nTable 42 presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value of securities available for sale that do not have an associated allowance for investment securities as of December 31, 2020. These securities are segregated between investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more, based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. All securities included in the table have been evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. As part of that assessment, as of December 31, 2020, we concluded that we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n119\nTable 42: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value of Securities Available for Sale Without an Allowance for Credit Losses\nTable 43 presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2019, prior to the adoption of the CECL standard. These securities are segregated between investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more, based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis.\nTable 43: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value of Debt Securities\nInformation relating to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of securities is set forth in the following table:\nTable 44: Gains (Losses) on Sales of Securities Available for Sale\n120\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents, by remaining contractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair value and weighted-average yield of debt securities at December 31, 2020:\nTable 45: Contractual Maturity of Debt Securities\n(a) Weighted-average yields are based on amortized cost with effective yields weighted for the contractual maturity of each security. Actual maturities and yields may differ as certain securities may be prepaid.\nAt December 31, 2020, there were no securities of a single issuer, other than FNMA and FHLMC, that exceeded 10% of total shareholders’ equity. The FNMA and FHLMC investments had a total amortized cost of $\n32.9\nbillion and $\n14.7\nbillion and fair value of $\n34.2\nbillion and $\n14.9\nbillion, respectively.\nThe following table presents the fair value of securities that have been either pledged to or accepted from others to collateralize outstanding borrowings:\nTable 46: Fair Value of Securities Pledged and Accepted as Collateral\n(a)\nBalances at December 31, 2019 include $\n2.0\nbillion in fair value of securities accepted from others to collateralize short-term investments in resale agreements that were not repledged.\nThe securities pledged to others include positions held in our portfolio of investment securities, trading securities and securities accepted as collateral from others that we are permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge, and were used to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n121\nN\nOTE\n4\nL\nOANS\nA\nND\nR\nELATED\nA\nLLOWANCE\nF\nOR\nC\nREDIT\nL\nOSSES\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio consists of\ntwo\nportfolio segments – Commercial and Consumer. Each of these segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information on our loan related policies.\nCredit Quality\nWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk within the loan portfolio based on our defined loan classes. In doing so, we use several credit quality indicators, including trends in delinquency rates, nonperforming status, analysis of PD and LGD ratings, updated credit scores, and originated and updated LTV ratios.\nThe measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. With the adoption of the CECL standard, accruing loans past due as of December 31, 2020 include PCD loans, while amounts as of December 31, 2019 excluded purchased impaired loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of this standard, including the discontinuation of purchased impaired loan accounting.\nThe following table presents the composition and delinquency status of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Pursuant to the interagency guidance issued in April 2020 and in connection with the credit reporting rules from the CARES Act, the December 31, 2020 delinquency status of loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships aligns with the rules set forth for banks to report delinquency status to the credit agencies. These rules require that COVID-19 related loan modifications be reported as follows:\n•\nif current at the time of modification, the loan remains current throughout the modification period,\n•\nif delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was not made current as part of the modification, the loan maintains its reported delinquent status during the modification period, or\n•\nif delinquent at the time of modification and the borrower was made current as part of the modification or became current during the modification period, the loan is reported as current.\nAs a result, certain loans modified due to COVID-19 related hardships are not being reported as past due as of December 31, 2020 based on the contractual terms of the loan, even where borrowers may not be making payments on their loans during the modification period. Loan modifications due to COVID-19 related hardships that permanently reduce either the contractual interest rate or the principal balance of a loan do not qualify for TDR relief under the CARES Act or the interagency guidance.\n122\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nTable 47: Analysis of Loan Portfolio\n(a)\nAmounts in table represent loans held for investment and do not include any associated valuation allowance.\n(b)\nThe accrued interest associated with our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 totaled $\n0.7\nbillion and is included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c)\nPast due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate loans and Education loans totaling $\n0.4\nbillion and $\n0.2\nbillion, respectively, at December 31, 2020.\n(d)\nConsumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the nonperforming loan population.\n(e)\nNet of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans totaling $\n1.3\nbillion at December 31, 2020.\n(f)\nCollateral dependent loans totaled $\n1.5\nbillion at December 31, 2020. The majority of these loans are within the Home equity and Residential real estate loan classes and are secured by consumer real estate.\n(g)    Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.\n(h)    Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we accreted interest income over the expected life of the loans. Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate loans totaling $\n0.4\nbillion and Education loans totaling $\n0.2\nbillion at December 31, 2019.\n(i)     Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the nonperforming loan population.\n(j)     Net of unearned income, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and premiums or discounts on purchased loans totaling $\n1.1\nbillion at December 31, 2019.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n123\nIn the normal course of business, we originate or purchase loan products with contractual characteristics that, when concentrated, may\nincrease our exposure as a holder of those loan products. Possible product features that may create a concentration of credit risk would\ninclude a high original or updated LTV ratio, terms that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments\nabove increases in market interest rates, and interest-only loans, among others.\nWe originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. Such credit arrangements are usually designed to match borrower cash flow\nexpectations (e.g., working capital lines, revolvers). These products are standard in the financial services industry and product features are considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk that the interest-only feature may result in borrowers not\nbeing able to make interest and principal payments when due. We do not believe that these product features create a concentration of\ncredit risk.\nAt December 31, 2020, we pledged $\n30.1\nbillion of commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank and $\n69.0\nbillion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank as collateral for the ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2019 were $\n16.9\nbillion and $\n68.0\nbillion, respectively. Amounts pledged reflect the unpaid principal balances.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans, however, when nonaccrual criteria is met interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest.\nWith the adoption of the CECL standard, nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2020 include PCD loans. Amounts as of December 31, 2019 excluded purchased impaired loans as we were accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of this standard and our nonperforming loan and lease policies.\nThe following table presents our nonperforming assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTable 48: Nonperforming Assets\n(a)\nExcludes most unsecured consumer loans and lines of credit, which are charged off after\n120\nto\n180\ndays past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.\n(b)\nNonperforming loans for which there is no related ALLL totaled $\n0.8\nbillion at December 31, 2020, and is primarily comprised of loans with a valuation that exceeds the amortized cost basis.\nNonperforming loans also include certain loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies and the TDR section of this Note 4 for additional information on TDRs.\nTotal nonperforming loans in Table 48 include TDRs of $\n0.9\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $\n0.7\nbillion and $\n0.8\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and are excluded from nonperforming loans.\nAdditional Credit Quality Indicators by Loan Class\nCommercial and Industrial\nFor commercial and industrial loans, we monitor the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower’s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process. These ratings\n124\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nare reviewed and updated, generally at least once per year. For small balance homogeneous pools of commercial and industrial loans and leases, we apply scoring techniques to assist in determining the PD. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned to commercial and industrial loans, capturing both the combination of expectations of default and loss severity in the event of default, reflects credit quality characteristics as of the reporting date and are used as inputs into our loss forecasting process.\nBased upon the amount of the lending arrangement and our risk rating assessment, we follow a formal schedule of written periodic reviews. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews of a market’s or business unit’s loan portfolio, focusing on those loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs and LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is weakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any customer obligation and its level of credit risk more frequently. We attempt to proactively manage our loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.\nCommercial Real Estate\nWe manage credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgages similar to commercial and industrial loans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks associated with commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk.\nAs with the commercial and industrial loan class, a formal schedule of periodic reviews is also performed to assess market/geographic risk and business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these overviews, more in-depth reviews and increased scrutiny are placed on areas of higher risk, such as adverse changes in risk ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that concern management. These reviews are designed to assess risk and facilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\nEquipment Lease Financing\nWe manage credit risk associated with our equipment lease financing loan class similar to commercial and industrial loans by analyzing PD and LGD.\nBased upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic reviews. Generally, this occurs quarterly, although we have established practices to review such credit risk more frequently if circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements, and regulatory compliance as applicable.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n125\nTable 49: Commercial Credit Quality Indicators (a)\n(a)\nLoans in our commercial portfolio are classified as Pass Rated or Criticized based on the regulatory definitions, which are driven by the PD and LGD ratings that we assign. The Criticized classification includes loans that were rated special mention, substandard or doubtful as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nHome Equity and Residential Real Estate\nWe use several credit quality indicators, including delinquency information, nonperforming loan information, updated credit scores, originated and updated LTV ratios, to monitor and manage credit risk within the home equity and residential real estate loan classes. A summary of credit quality indicators follows:\nDelinquency/Delinquency Rates\n:\nWe monitor trending of delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential real estate loans. See Table 47 for additional information.\nNonperforming Loans\n:\nWe monitor trending of nonperforming loans for home equity and residential real estate loans. See Table 47 for additional information.\nCredit Scores:\nWe use a national third-party provider to update FICO credit scores for home equity and residential real estate loans at least quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan classes.\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and subordinate lien positions):\nAt least quarterly, we update the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes.\nWe use a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes (\ne.g.\n, line management, loss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given certain data limitations, it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management’s assumptions (\ni.e.\n, if an updated LTV is not provided by the third-party service provider, HPI changes will be incorporated in arriving at management’s estimate of updated LTV).\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. The related estimates and inputs are based upon an approach that uses a combination of third-party automated valuation models, broker price opinions, HPI indices, property location, internal and external balance information, origination data and management assumptions. We generally utilize origination lien balances provided by a third-party, where applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of\n126\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nthe calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by others, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we refine our methodology.\nThe following table presents credit quality indicators for the home equity and residential real estate loan classes:\nTable 50: Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Credit Quality Indicators\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n127\nAutomobile, Credit Card, Education and Other Consumer\nWe monitor a variety of credit quality information in the management of these consumer loan classes. For all loan types, we generally use a combination of internal loan parameters as well as an updated FICO score. We use FICO scores as a primary credit quality indicator for automobile and credit card loans, as well as non-government guaranteed or non-insured education loans and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Internal credit metrics, such as delinquency status, are heavily relied upon as credit quality indicators for government guaranteed or insured education loans and consumer loans to high net worth individuals, as internal credit metrics are more relevant than FICO scores for these types of loans.\nAlong with the monitoring of delinquency trends and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are obtained at least quarterly along with a variety of credit bureau attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have a higher likelihood of loss.\n128\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents credit quality indicators for the automobile, credit card, education and other consumer loan classes:\nTable 51: Credit Quality Indicators for Automobile, Credit Card, Education and Other Consumer Loan Classes\n(a)\nLoans with no FICO score available or required generally refers to new accounts issued to borrowers with limited credit history, accounts for which we cannot obtain an updated FICO score (e.g., recent profile changes), cards issued with a business name and/or cards secured by collateral. Management proactively assesses the risk and size of this loan category and, when necessary, takes actions to mitigate the credit risk.\n(b)\nWeighted-average updated FICO score excludes accounts with no FICO score available or required.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n129\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nA TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Loans that have been restructured for COVID-19 related hardships and meet certain criteria under the CARES Act are not categorized as TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to TDRs.\nTable 52 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs as well as the change in the loans’ balance as a result of becoming a TDR during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions. The Principal Forgiveness TDR category includes principal forgiveness and accrued interest forgiveness. The Rate Reduction TDR category includes reduced interest rate and interest deferral. The Other TDR category primarily includes consumer borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us, as well as postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and contractual extensions for both consumer and commercial borrowers.\nIn some cases, there have been multiple concessions granted on one loan. This is most common within the commercial loan portfolio. When there have been multiple concessions granted in the commercial loan portfolio, the principal forgiveness concession was prioritized for purposes of determining the inclusion in Table 52. Second in priority would be rate reduction. In the event that multiple concessions are granted on a consumer loan, concessions resulting from discharge from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy without formal affirmation of the loan obligations to us would be prioritized and included in the Other type of concession in Table 52. After that, consumer loan concessions would follow the previously discussed priority of concessions for the commercial loan portfolio.\nTable 52: Financial Impact and TDRs by Concession Type\n(a)\nImpact of partial charge-offs at TDR date are included in this table.\n(b)\nRepresents the amortized cost basis of the loans as of the quarter end prior to TDR designation.\n(c)\nRepresents the amortized cost basis of the TDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the TDR occurs.\n(d)    Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date are included in this table.\n(e)    Represents the recorded investment of the loans as of the quarter end prior to TDR designation, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.\n(f)    Represents the recorded investment of the TDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the TDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.\nAfter a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent restructured terms. We consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. Loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs, and (ii) subsequently defaulted during the period totaled $\n0.1\nbillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain the ACL related to loans at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the portfolios as of the balance sheet date. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for a discussion of the methodologies used to determine this allowance. A rollforward of the ACL related to loans follows:\n130\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nTable 53: Rollforward of Allowance for Credit Losses\n(a)\n(a)    Excludes allowances for investment securities and other financial assets, which together totaled $\n109\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\n(b)     Represents the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments -\nCredit Losses\non January 1, 2020 and our transition from an incurred loss methodology for our  reserves to an expected credit loss methodology.\n(c)    See Note 11 Commitments for additional information about the underlying commitments related to this allowance.\nThe following presents an analysis of changes impacting the ACL related to loans for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nTable 54:  Analysis of Changes in the Allowance for Credit Losses (a)\nIn millions\n(a) Excludes allowances for investment securities and other financial assets, which together totaled $\n109\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\n(b) Portfolio changes primarily represent the impact of increases/decreases in loan balances, age and mix due to new originations/purchases, as well as credit quality and net charge-off activity.\n(c) Economic and qualitative factors primarily represent our evaluation and determination of an economic forecast applied to our loan portfolio, which is based on a three year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, as well as updates to qualitative factor adjustments.\nThe $\n2.2\nbillion increase in the ACL since January 1, 2020 was driven by the following factors in the commercial and consumer portfolios:\n•\nCommercial reserves increased $\n1.9\nbillion attributable to the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic and its resulting effects on credit quality and loan growth.\n•\nConsumer reserves increased $\n0.3\nbillion primarily reflecting the significantly adverse economic impacts of the pandemic.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n131\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nPrior to January 1, 2020, we maintained our ALLL at levels we believed to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the portfolios as of the balance sheet date. We used the two main portfolio segments - Commercial and Consumer, and developed and documented the ALLL under separate methodologies for each of these portfolio segments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies for a summary of the accounting policies for ALLL prior to the adoption of CECL.\nA rollforward of the ALLL and associated loan data follows:\nTable 55: Rollforward of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Associated Loan Data\n(a)\nLoans accounted for under the fair value option were not evaluated for impairment as these loans are accounted for at fair value. Accordingly, there was no allowance recorded on those loans.\n132\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nN\nOTE\n5\nL\nOAN\nS\nALE AND\nS\nERVICING\nA\nCTIVITIES AND\nV\nARIABLE\nI\nNTEREST\nE\nNTITIES\nLoan Sale and Servicing Activities\nWe have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. These transfers have occurred through Agency securitization, Non-agency securitization, and loan sale transactions. Agency securitizations consist of securitization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA (collectively, the Agencies). FNMA and FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market through SPEs that they sponsor. As an authorized GNMA issuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of VA insured loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market. In Non-agency securitizations, we have transferred loans into securitization SPEs. In other instances, third-party investors have also purchased our loans in loan sale transactions and in certain instances have subsequently sold these loans into securitization SPEs. Securitization SPEs utilized in the Agency and Non-agency securitization transactions are VIEs.\nOur continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs.\nDepending on the transaction, we may act as the master, primary and/or special servicer to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors. Servicing responsibilities typically consist of collecting and remitting monthly borrower principal and interest payments, maintaining escrow deposits, performing loss mitigation and foreclosure activities, and, in certain instances, funding of servicing advances. Servicing advances, which are generally reimbursable, are made for principal and interest and collateral protection and are carried in Other assets at cost.\nWe earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 6 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights and Note 15 Fair Value for further discussion of our servicing rights.\nCertain loans transferred to the Agencies contain ROAPs. Under these ROAPs, we hold an option to repurchase at par individual delinquent loans that meet certain criteria. In other limited cases, GNMA has granted us the right to repurchase current loans when we intend to modify the borrower’s interest rate under established guidelines. When we have the unilateral ability to repurchase a loan, effective control over the loan has been regained and we recognize an asset (in either Loans or Loans held for sale) and a corresponding liability (in Other borrowed funds) on the balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan.\nThe Agency and Non-agency mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs that are purchased and held on our balance sheet are typically purchased in the secondary market. We do not retain any credit risk on our Agency mortgage-backed security positions as FNMA, FHLMC and the U.S. Government (for GNMA) guarantee losses of principal and interest.\nWe also have involvement with certain Agency and Non-agency commercial securitization SPEs where we have not transferred commercial mortgage loans. These SPEs were sponsored by independent third-parties and the loans held by these entities were purchased exclusively from other third-parties. Generally, our involvement with these SPEs is as servicer with servicing activities consistent with those described above.\nWe recognize a liability for our loss exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to possible breaches of representations and warranties and also for loss sharing arrangements (recourse obligations) with the Agencies. Other than providing temporary liquidity under servicing advances and our loss exposure associated with our repurchase and recourse obligations, we have not provided nor are we required to provide any type of credit support, guarantees or commitments to the securitization SPEs or third-party investors in these transactions.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n133\nThe following table provides cash flows associated with our loan sale and servicing activities:\nTable 56: Cash Flows Associated with Loan Sale and Servicing Activities\n(a)\nRepresents cash flow information associated with both commercial mortgage loan transfer and servicing activities.\n(b)\nGains/losses recognized on sales of loans were insignificant for the periods presented.\n(c)\nIncludes both residential and commercial mortgage government insured or guaranteed loans eligible for repurchase through the exercise of our ROAP option, as well as residential mortgage loans repurchased due to alleged breaches of origination covenants or representations and warranties made to purchasers.\n(d)\nIncludes contractually specified servicing fees, late charges and ancillary fees.\n(e)\nRepresents cash flows on securities where we transferred to, and/or service loans for, a securitization SPE and we hold securities issued by that SPE. The carrying values of such securities held were $\n16.5\nbillion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $\n0.8\nbillion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2020 and $\n17.8\nbillion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $\n0.6\nbillion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2019.\nTable 57 presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan, where the repurchase price exceeded the loan’s fair value, due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing involvement with these loans. The estimate of losses related to breaches in representations and warranties was insignificant at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 57: Principal Balance, Delinquent Loans and Net Charge-offs Related to Serviced Loans For Others\n(a)\nRepresents information at the securitization level in which we have sold loans and we are the servicer for the securitization.\n(b)\nServiced delinquent loans are 90 days or more past due or are in process of foreclosure.\n(c)\nNet charge-offs for Residential mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported to investors during the period. Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs)\nWe are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs. We assess VIEs for consolidation based upon the accounting policies described in Note 1 Accounting Policies. Our consolidated VIEs were insignificant at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. We have not provided additional financial support to these entities which we are not contractually required to provide.\nThe following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We have excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 58 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is not significant. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the normal\n134\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\ncourse of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated entities from the balances presented in Table 58. These loans are included as part of the asset quality disclosures that we make in Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.\nTable 58: Non-Consolidated VIEs\n(a)\nRepresents loans, investments and other assets related to non-consolidated VIEs, net of collateral (if applicable). The risk of loss excludes any potential tax recapture associated with tax credit investments.\n(b)\nAmounts reflect involvement with securitization SPEs where we transferred to, and/or service loans for, an SPE and we hold securities issued by that SPE. Values disclosed in the PNC Risk of Loss column represent our maximum exposure to loss for those securities’ holdings.\n(c)\nIncluded in Investment securities, Mortgage servicing rights and Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(d)\nIncluded in Investment securities, Loans, Equity investments and Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(e)\nIncluded in Deposits and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nMortgage-Backed Securitizations\nIn connection with each Agency and Non-agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securitization discussed above, we evaluate each SPE utilized in these transactions for consolidation. In performing these assessments, we evaluate our level of continuing involvement in these transactions as the nature of our involvement ultimately determines whether or not we hold a variable interest and/or are the primary beneficiary of the SPE. Factors we consider in our consolidation assessment include the significance of (i) our role as servicer, (ii) our holdings of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPE and (iii) the rights of third-party variable interest holders.\nThe first step in our assessment is to determine whether we hold a variable interest in the securitization SPE. We hold variable interests in Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs through our holding of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by the SPEs and/or our recourse obligations. Each SPE in which we hold a variable interest is evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. For Agency securitization transactions, our contractual role as servicer does not give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPEs. Thus, we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities. For Non-agency securitization transactions, we would be the primary beneficiary to the extent our servicing activities give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the SPE and we hold a more than insignificant variable interest in the entity.\nDetails about the Agency and Non-agency securitization SPEs where we hold a variable interest and are not the primary beneficiary are included in Table 58. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these SPEs is the carrying value of the mortgage-backed securities, servicing assets, servicing advances and our liabilities associated with our recourse obligations. Creditors of the securitization SPEs have no recourse to our assets or general credit.\nTax Credit Investments and Other\nFor tax credit investments in which we do not have the right to make decisions that will most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, we are not the primary beneficiary and thus do not consolidate the entity. These investments are disclosed in Table 58. The table also reflects our maximum exposure to loss exclusive of any potential tax credit recapture. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to our legally binding equity commitments adjusted for recorded impairment, partnership results or amortization for qualifying low income housing tax credit investments when applicable. For all legally binding unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of December 31, 2020, we had a liability for unfunded commitments of $\n1.1\nbillion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects which is reflected in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTable 58 also includes our involvement in lease financing transactions with LLCs engaged in solar power generation that, to a large extent, provided returns in the form of tax credits. The outstanding financings and operating lease assets are reflected as Loans and Other assets, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas related liabilities are reported in Deposits and Other liabilities.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n135\nWe make certain equity investments in various tax credit limited partnerships or LLCs. The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During 2020 we recognized $\n0.2\nbillion of amortization, $\n0.2\nbillion of tax credits and less than $\n0.1\nbillion of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes.\nN\nOTE\n6\nG\nOODWILL AND\nM\nORTGAGE\nS\nERVICING\nR\nIGHTS\nAssets and liabilities of acquired entities are recorded at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.\nGoodwill\nAllocations of Goodwill by business segment during 2020, 2019 and 2018 follow:\nTable 59: Goodwill by Business Segment\nWe review goodwill in each of our reporting units for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances have changed significantly from the annual test date. Based on the results of our analysis, there were\nno\nimpairment charges related to goodwill in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies for additional information related to the adoption of ASU 2017-04, which simplified the goodwill impairment test.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe recognize the right to service mortgage loans for others as an intangible asset when the servicing income we receive is more than adequate compensation. MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained. MSRs totaled $\n1.2\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n1.6\nbillion at December 31, 2019, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value.\nCommercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\nWe recognize gains/(losses) on changes in the fair value of commercial MSRs. Commercial MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of commercial MSRs with securities, derivative instruments and resale agreements which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of commercial MSRs decreases (or increases).\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating inputs for assumptions as to constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors determined based on current market conditions and expectations.\nChanges in the commercial MSRs follow:\nTable 60: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights\n(a)\nRepresents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that were paid down or paid off during the period.\n(b)\nRepresents MSR value changes resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.\n136\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nResidential Mortgage Servicing Rights\nResidential MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of residential MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of residential MSRs decreases (or increases).\nThe fair value of residential MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors which are determined based on current market conditions.\nChanges in the residential MSRs follow:\nTable 61: Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights\n(a)\nRepresents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that were paid down or paid off during the period.\n(b)\nRepresents MSR value changes resulting from market-driven changes in interest rates.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of December 31, 2020 are shown in Tables 62 and 63. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.\nA sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented in Tables 62 and 63. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (\ne.g.\n, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n137\nThe following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions:\nTable 62: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights – Key Valuation Assumptions\nTable 63: Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights – Key Valuation Assumptions\nFees from mortgage loan servicing, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees were $\n0.5\nbillion for each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. We also generate servicing fees from fee-based activities provided to others for which we do not have an associated servicing asset. Fees from commercial and residential MSRs are reported within Noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement in Corporate services and Residential mortgage, respectively.\nN\nOTE\n7\nL\nEASES\nPNC enters into both lessor and lessee arrangements. For more information on lease accounting, see Note 1 Accounting Policies and for additional details on our equipment lease financing receivables see Note 4 Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses.\nLessor Arrangements\nPNC’s lessor arrangements primarily consist of direct financing, sales-type and operating leases for equipment. Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term.\nThe following table provides details on our income from lessor arrangements:\nTable 64: Lease Income\n(a)\nIncluded in Loan interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.\n(b)\nIncluded in Corporate services on the Consolidated Income Statement.\n138\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table provides the components of our equipment lease financing assets:\nTable 65:  Sales-Type and Direct Financing Leases\n(a)\nIn certain cases, PNC obtains third-party residual value insurance to reduce its residual risk. The carrying value of residual assets with third-party residual value insurance for at least a portion of the asset value was $\n0.4\nbillion and $\n0.3\nbillion for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOperating lease assets were $\n1.0\nbillion and accumulated depreciation was $\n0.2\nbillion at December 31, 2020 compared to operating lease assets of $\n1.1\nbillion and accumulated depreciation of $\n0.3\nbillion at December 31, 2019. We had no lease transactions with related parties or deferred selling profits at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe future minimum lease payments based on maturity of our lessor arrangements at December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nTable 66:  Future Minimum Lease Payments of Lessor Arrangements\nLessee Arrangements\nWe lease retail branches, datacenters, office space, land and equipment under operating and finance leases. Our leases have remaining lease terms of\none year\nto\n47\nyears, some of which may include options to renew the leases for up to\n99\nyears, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases prior to the end date. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased asset. The exercise of lease renewal, termination and purchase options is at our sole discretion.\nWe recognize on the balance sheet all leases with lease terms greater than twelve months as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use asset. At adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and nonlease components of existing real estate leases and leases of advertising assets, such as signage, as a single lease component. Effective January 1, 2019, lease and nonlease components of new lease agreements are accounted for separately. Lease components consist of fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs and nonlease components consist of common-area maintenance costs. In addition, we elected the practical expedient to not apply the recognition requirements under the standard to short-term leases.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, as we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nGenerally, we have elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to the term of the lease at the lease measurement date as our incremental borrowing rate to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability.\nCertain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of revenue and others include rental payments if certain bank deposit levels are met.

In June 1998, PNC Capital Trust C issued $\n200\nmillion of trust preferred securities which bear interest at an annual rate of 3 month LIBOR plus\n57\nbasis points. The trust preferred securities are currently redeemable by PNC Capital Trust C at par. In accordance with GAAP, the financial statements of the Trust are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe obligations of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., as the parent of the Trust, when taken collectively, are the equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee of the obligations of the Trust under the terms of the trust preferred securities. Such guarantee is subordinate in right of payment in the same manner as other junior subordinated debt. There are certain restrictions on our overall ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries. For additional disclosure on these funding restrictions, see Note 20 Regulatory Matters.\nWe are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments, in connection with the outstanding junior subordinated debentures. Generally, if (i) there is an event of default under the debentures, (ii) we elect to defer interest on the debentures, (iii) we exercise our right to defer payments on the related trust preferred securities, or (iv) there is a default under our guarantee of such payment obligations, subject to certain limited exceptions, we would be unable during the period of such default or deferral to make payments on our debt securities that rank equal or junior to the debentures as well as to make payments on our equity securities, including dividend payments.\nN\nOTE\n11\nC\nOMMITMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe following table presents our outstanding commitments to extend credit along with other commitments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 76: Commitments to Extend Credit and Other Commitments\n(a)\nNet outstanding standby letters of credit include $\n3.8\nbillion and $\n4.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, which support remarketing programs.\n(b)\nRepresents aggregate maximum exposure up to the specified limits of the reinsurance contracts provided by our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary.

These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee and generally contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates.\nNet Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit\nWe issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Approximately\n96\n% of our net outstanding standby letters of credit were rated as Pass at December 31, 2020, with the remainder rated as Criticized. An internal credit rating of Pass indicates the expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Criticized indicates a higher degree of risk.\n142\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nIf the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them.

In June 2019, we announced share repurchase programs of up to $\n4.3\nbillion for the four quarter period beginning with the third quarter of 2019, in accordance with PNC’s 2019 capital plan. In January 2020, we announced an increase to these programs to repurchase up to an additional $\n1.0\nbillion in common shares through the end of the second quarter of 2020. PNC announced on March 16, 2020 a temporary suspension of our common stock repurchase program in conjunction with the Federal Reserve’s effort to support the U.S. economy during the pandemic. We continued the suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 with the exception of employee benefit-related purchases in the third quarter, consistent with the extension of the Federal Reserve’s special capital distribution restrictions. Under these program authorizations we repurchased\n11.0\nmillion shares in 2020 and\n25.9\nmillion shares in 2019. A maximum amount of\n75.1\nmillion shares remained available for repurchase under the new stock program authorization at December 31, 2020.  In 2021, our plan is to refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases, during the period leading up to our pending BBVA transaction close date, expected to be mid-2021.\nN\nOTE\n13\nO\nTHER\nC\nOMPREHENSIVE\nI\nNCOME\nDetails of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows:\nTable 80: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n(a)\nReclassifications for pre-tax debt securities and cash flow hedges are recorded in interest income and noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.\n(b)\nReclassifications include amortization of actuarial losses (gains) and amortization of prior period services costs (credits) which are recorded in noninterest expense on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n145\nTable 81: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components\n(a)\nRepresents the cumulative impact of adopting ASU 2018-02 which permits the reclassification to retained earnings of the income tax effects stranded within AOCI.\nN\nOTE\n14\nE\nARNINGS\nP\nER\nS\nHARE\nTable 82: Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share\n(a)\nBasic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method are determined on net income reported on the income statement less earnings allocated to nonvested restricted shares and restricted share units with nonforfeitable dividends and dividend rights (participating securities).\n(b)\nSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information on our policy for not allocating losses to participating securities.\n146\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nN\nOTE\n15\nF\nAIR\nV\nALUE\nFair Value Measurement\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date, and is determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n•\nLevel 1:\nFair value is determined using a quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities may include debt securities, equity securities and listed derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, and certain U.S. Treasury securities that are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n•\nLevel 2:\nFair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. The majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities and listed derivative contracts with quoted prices that are traded in markets that are not active, and certain debt and equity securities and over-the-counter derivative contracts whose fair value is determined using a pricing model without significant unobservable inputs.\n•\nLevel 3:\nFair value is estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which the significant valuation inputs are not observable and the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nWe characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with reasonably narrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based on current information. Inactive markets are typically characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants or are not based on current information, wide bid/ask spreads, a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuance, or any combination of the above factors. We also consider nonperformance risks, including credit risk, as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value, by their nature, result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 inherently require the use of various assumptions, estimates and judgments when measuring their fair value. As observable market activity is commonly not available to use when estimating the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities, we must estimate fair value using various modeling techniques. These techniques include the use of a variety of inputs/assumptions including credit quality, liquidity, interest rates or other relevant inputs across the entire population of our Level 3 assets and liabilities. Changes in the significant underlying factors or assumptions (either an increase or a decrease) in any of these areas underlying our estimates may have resulted in a significant increase/decrease in the Level 3 fair value measurement of a particular asset and/or liability from period to period.\nAny models used to determine fair values or to validate dealer quotes are subject to review and independent testing as part of our model validation and internal control testing processes. Our Model Risk Management Group reviews significant models on at least an annual basis. In addition, the Valuation Committee approves valuation methodologies and reviews the results of independent valuation reviews and processes for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nWe account for certain residential mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages with the related hedges. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nWe account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale in whole loan transactions at fair value. We determine the fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale based upon discounted cash flows. Fair value is determined using sale valuation assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the loans.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n147\nValuation assumptions may include observable inputs based on the benchmark interest rate swap curve, whole loan sales and agency sales transactions. The significant unobservable input for commercial mortgage loans held for sale, excluding those to be sold to agencies, is management’s assumption of the spread applied to the benchmark rate. The spread over the benchmark curve includes management’s assumptions of the impact of credit and liquidity risk. Significant increases (decreases) in the spread applied to the benchmark would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) asset value. The wide range of the spread over the benchmark curve is due to the varying risk and underlying property characteristics within our portfolio. Based on the significance of the unobservable input we classified this portfolio as Level 3.\nFor loans to be sold to agencies with servicing retained, the fair value is adjusted for the estimated servicing cash flows, which is an unobservable input. This adjustment is not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in the input to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, commercial mortgage loans held for sale to agencies are classified as Level 2.\nSecurities Available for Sale and Trading Securities\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include both the available for sale and trading portfolios. We primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. The majority of securities were priced by third-party vendors. The third-party vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. We monitor and validate the reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through pricing methodology reviews, including detailed reviews of the assumptions and inputs used by the vendor to price individual securities, and through price validation testing. Securities not priced by one of our pricing vendors may be valued using a dealer quote, which are also subject to price validation testing. Price validation testing is performed independent of the risk-taking function and involves corroborating the prices received from third-party vendors and dealers with prices from another third party or through other sources, such as internal valuations or sales of similar securities. Security prices are also validated through actual cash settlement upon sale of a security.\nSecurities are classified within the fair value hierarchy after giving consideration to the activity level in the market for the security type and the observability of the inputs used to determine the fair value. When a quoted price in an active market exists for the identical security, this price is used to determine fair value and the security is classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities.\nWhen a quoted price in an active market for the identical security is not available, fair value is estimated using either an alternative market approach, such as a recent trade or matrix pricing, or an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow pricing model. If the inputs to the valuation are based primarily on market observable information, then the security is classified within Level 2 of the hierarchy. Level 2 securities include agency debt securities, agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities collateralized by non-mortgage-related corporate and consumer loans, and other debt securities. Level 2 securities are predominantly priced by third parties, either by a pricing vendor or dealer.\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around the inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Securities classified as Level 3 consist primarily of non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by first- and second-lien residential mortgage loans. Fair value for these securities is primarily estimated using pricing obtained from third-party vendors. In some cases, fair value is estimated using a dealer quote, by reference to prices of securities of a similar vintage and collateral type or by reference to recent sales of similar securities. Market activity for these security types is limited with little price transparency. As a result, these securities are generally valued by the third-party vendor using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates significant unobservable inputs and observable market activity where available. Significant inputs to the valuation include prepayment projections and credit loss assumptions (default rate and loss severity) and discount rates that are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those assumptions in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\nCertain infrequently traded debt securities within Other debt securities available for sale and Trading securities are also classified in Level 3 and are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85. The significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value of these securities include an estimate of expected credit losses and a discount for liquidity risk. These inputs are incorporated into the fair value measurement by either increasing the spread over the benchmark curve or by applying a credit and liquidity discount to the par value of the security. Significant increases (decreases) in credit and/or liquidity risk could have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value estimate.\nLoans\nLoans accounted for at fair value consist primarily of residential mortgage loans. These loans are generally valued similarly to residential mortgage loans held for sale and are classified as Level 2. However, similar to residential mortgage loans held for sale, if these loans are repurchased and unsalable, they are classified as Level 3. In addition, repurchased VA loans, where only a portion of the principal will be reimbursed, are classified as Level 3. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation based on our historical loss rate. We have elected to account for certain home equity lines of credit at fair value. These loans are classified as\n148\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nLevel 3. Significant inputs to the valuation of these loans include credit and liquidity discount, cumulative default rate, loss severity and gross discount rate and are deemed representative of current market conditions. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these assumptions would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments includes money market mutual funds as well as direct and indirect private equity investments. Money market mutual funds are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities and classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. The valuation of direct and indirect private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such investments. Various valuation techniques are used for direct investments, including multiples of adjusted earnings of the entity, independent appraisals, anticipated financing and sale transactions with third parties, or the pricing used to value the entity in a recent financing transaction. A multiple of adjusted earnings calculation is the valuation technique utilized most frequently and is the most significant unobservable input used in such calculation. Significant decreases (increases) in the multiple of earnings could have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Direct equity investments are classified as Level 3.\nIndirect investments are not redeemable; however, we receive distributions over the life of the partnerships from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee, which we expect to occur over the next\n10\nyears. We value indirect investments in private equity funds using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient as provided in the financial statements that we receive from fund managers. Due to the time lag in our receipt of the financial information and based on a review of investments and valuation techniques applied, adjustments to the manager-provided value are made when available recent portfolio company information or market information indicates a significant change in value from that provided by the manager of the fund. Indirect investments valued using NAV are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nMortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)\nMSRs are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Assumptions incorporated into the MSRs valuation model reflect management’s best estimate of factors that a market participant would use in valuing the MSRs. Although sales of MSRs do occur and can offer some market insight, MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices so the precise terms and conditions of sales are not available.\nResidential MSRs\nAs a benchmark for the reasonableness of our residential MSRs fair value, we obtained opinions of value from independent brokers. These brokers provided a range (+/-\n10\nbps) based upon their own discounted cash flow calculations of our portfolio that reflect conditions in the secondary market and any recently executed servicing transactions. We compare our internally-developed residential MSRs value to the ranges of values received from the brokers. If our residential MSRs fair value falls outside of the brokers’ ranges, management will assess whether a valuation adjustment is warranted. For the periods presented, our residential MSRs value did not fall outside of the brokers’ ranges. We consider our residential MSRs value to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nDue to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified as Level 3. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of residential MSRs are constant prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve. Significant increases (decreases) in prepayment rates and spread over the benchmark curve would have resulted in lower (higher) fair market value of residential MSRs.\nCommercial MSRs\nThe fair value of commercial MSRs is estimated by using a discounted cash flow model incorporating unobservable inputs for assumptions such as constant prepayment rates, discount rates and other factors. Due to the nature of the unobservable valuation inputs and the limited availability of market pricing, commercial MSRs are classified as Level 3. Significant increases (decreases) in constant prepayment rates and discount rates would have resulted in significantly lower (higher) commercial MSR value determined based on current market conditions and expectations.\nFinancial Derivatives\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1. The majority of derivatives that we enter into are executed over-the-counter and are valued using internal models. These derivatives are primarily classified as Level 2, as the readily observable market inputs to these models are validated to external sources, such as industry pricing services, or are corroborated through recent trades, dealer quotes, yield curves, implied volatility or other market-related data. Level 2 financial derivatives are primarily estimated using a combination of Eurodollar future prices and observable benchmark interest rate swaps to construct projected discounted cash flows.\nFinancial derivatives that are priced using significant management judgment or assumptions are classified as Level 3. Unobservable inputs related to interest rate contracts include probability of funding of residential mortgage loan commitments and estimated servicing cash flows of commercial and residential mortgage loan commitments. Probability of default and loss severity are the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of risk participation agreements. The fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n149\nrelated to these interest rate contract financial derivatives as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85 of this Note 15.\nIn connection with the sales of portions of our Visa Class B common shares, we entered into swap agreements with the purchasers of the shares to retain any future risk of decreases in the conversion rate of Class B common shares to Class A common shares resulting from increases in the escrow funded by Visa to pay for the costs of resolution of specified litigation (see Note 21 Legal Proceedings). These swaps also require PNC to make periodic payments based on the market price of the Class A common shares at a fixed rate of interest (in certain cases subject to step-up provisions) until the Visa litigation is resolved. An increase in the estimated length of litigation resolution date, a decrease in the estimated conversion rate, or an increase in the estimated growth rate of the Class A share price would have had a negative impact on the fair value of the swaps and vice versa.\nThe fair values of our derivatives include a credit valuation adjustment to reflect our own and our counterparties’ nonperformance risk. Our credit valuation adjustment is computed using credit default swap spreads, in conjunction with internal historical recovery observations.\nOther Assets and Liabilities\nOther assets held at fair value on a recurring basis primarily include assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans.\nThe assets related to PNC’s deferred compensation and supplemental incentive savings plans primarily consist of a prepaid forward contract referencing an amount of shares of PNC stock, equity mutual funds and fixed income funds, and are valued based on the underlying investments. These assets are valued either by reference to the market price of PNC’s stock or by using the quoted market prices for investments other than PNC’s stock and are classified in Levels 1 and 2.\nAll Level 3 other assets and liabilities are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85 in this Note 15.\nOther Borrowed Funds\nOther borrowed funds primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities sold short which are classified as Level 1. Other borrowed funds also includes the related liability for certain repurchased loans for which we have elected the fair value option and are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3, consistent with the level classification of the corresponding loans. All Level 3 amounts are included in the Insignificant Level 3 assets, net of liabilities line item in Table 85 in this Note 15.\n150\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table summarizes our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including instruments for which we have elected the fair value option.\nTable 83: Fair Value Measurements – Recurring Basis Summary\n(a)\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(b)\nIncluded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c)\nAmounts at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented gross and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.

The amortization and accretion amounts were included in Interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement and the remaining net gains (losses) realized and unrealized were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.\n(g)\nNet unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nAn instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n153\nQuantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs within Level 3 recurring assets and liabilities follows:\nTable 85: Fair Value Measurements – Recurring Quantitative Information\nDecember 31, 2020\n154\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nDecember 31, 2019\n(a)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instruments.\n(b)\nThe assumed yield spread over the benchmark curve for each instrument is generally intended to incorporate non-interest rate risks, such as credit and liquidity risks.\n(c)\nConsensus pricing refers to fair value estimates that are generally internally developed using information such as dealer quotes or other third-party provided valuations or comparable asset prices.\n(d)\nRepresents the aggregate amount of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that are individually and in the aggregate insignificant. The amount includes certain financial derivative assets and liabilities, trading securities, other securities, residential mortgage loans held for sale, other assets, other borrowed funds and other liabilities.\n(e)\nConsisted of total Level 3 assets of $\n5.1\nbillion and total Level 3 liabilities of\n$\n0.3\nbillion\nas of December 31, 2020 and $\n5.4\nbillion and $\n0.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2019, respectively.\nFinancial Assets Accounted for at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe may be required to measure certain financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of amortized cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment and are included in Table 86.\nNonaccrual Loans\nNonaccrual loans represent the fair value of those loans which have been adjusted due to impairment. The impairment is primarily based on the appraised value of the collateral.\nAppraisals are obtained by licensed or certified appraisers at least annually and more recently in certain instances. All third-party appraisals are reviewed and any adjustments to the initial appraisal are incorporated into the final issued appraisal report. In instances where an appraisal is not obtained, collateral value is determined consistent with external third-party appraisal standards by an internal person independent of the asset manager.\nOREO and Foreclosed Assets\nThe carrying value of OREO and foreclosed assets includes valuation adjustments recorded subsequent to the transfer to OREO and foreclosed assets. These valuation adjustments are based on the fair value less cost to sell of the property. Fair value is based on appraised value or sales price and the appraisal process for OREO and foreclosed assets is the same as described above for nonaccrual loans.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consists of buildings for which valuation adjustments were recorded during the period. A facility classified as held and used is impaired to the extent its carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. Valuation adjustments on buildings held\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n155\nfor sale are based on the fair value of the property less an estimated cost to sell and are recorded subsequent to the transfer of the asset to held for sale status. Fair value is determined either by a third-party appraisal, recent sales offer, changes in market or property conditions, or, where we have agreed to sell the building to a third party, the contractual sales price. Impairment on these long-lived assets is recorded in Other noninterest expense on our Consolidated Income Statement.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis follow:\nTable 86: Fair Value Measurements – Nonrecurring (a) (b) (c)\n(a)\nAll Level 3 for the periods presented.\n(b)\nValuation techniques applied were fair value of property or collateral.\n(c)\nUnobservable inputs used were appraised value/sales price, broker opinions or projected income/required improvement costs. Additional quantitative information was not meaningful for the periods presented.\nFinancial Instruments Accounted for under Fair Value Option\nWe elect the fair value option to account for certain financial instruments. For more information on these financial instruments for which the fair value option election has been made, refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 15. These financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. Gains and losses from initial measurement and any changes in fair value are subsequently recognized in earnings.\nInterest income related to changes in the fair values of these financial instruments is recorded on the Consolidated Income Statement in Other interest income, except for certain Residential mortgage loans, for which income is also recorded in Loan interest income. Changes in the value on prepaid forward contracts included in Other assets is reported in Noninterest expense and interest expense on the Other borrowed funds is reported in Borrowed funds interest expense.\nFair values and aggregate unpaid principal balances of items for which we elected the fair value option follow\n:\nTable 87: Fair Value Option – Fair Value and Principal Balances\n(a)\nThere were no accruing loans 90 days or more past due within this category at December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\n156\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe changes in fair value for items for which we elected the fair value option are as follows:\nTable 88: Fair Value Option – Changes in Fair Value (a)\n(a)\nThe impact on earnings of offsetting hedged items or hedging instruments is not reflected in these amounts.\nAdditional Fair Value Information Related to Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value\nThis section presents fair value information for all other financial instruments that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value amounts for these financial instruments.\nCash and Due from Banks and Interest-earning Deposits with Banks\nDue to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts for Cash and due from banks and Interest-earning deposits with banks reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate fair value.\nSecurities Held to Maturity\nWe primarily use prices obtained from pricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities. Refer to the Fair Value Measurement section of this Note 15 for additional information relating to our pricing processes and procedures.\nNet Loans\nFair values are estimated based on the discounted value of expected net cash flows incorporating assumptions about prepayment rates, net credit losses and servicing fees. Nonaccrual loans are valued at their estimated recovery value. Loans are presented net of the ALLL.\nOther Assets\nOther assets includes accrued interest receivable, cash collateral, federal funds sold and resale agreements, certain loans held for sale, and FHLB and FRB stock. The aggregate carrying value of our FHLB and FRB stock was $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.6\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which approximated fair value at each date.\nDeposits\nFor time deposits, fair values are estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities. For deposits with no defined maturity, such as noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand and interest-bearing money market and savings deposits, carrying values approximate fair values.\nBorrowed Funds\nFor short-term borrowed funds, including federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements and certain other short-term borrowings and payables, carrying values approximated fair values. For long-term borrowed funds, quoted market prices are used, when available, to estimate fair value. When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on current market interest rates and credit spreads for debt with similar terms and maturities.\nUnfunded Lending Related Commitments and Letters of Credit\nThe fair value of unfunded lending related commitments and letters of credit is determined from a market participant’s view including the impact of changes in interest rates and credit. We establish a liability on these facilities related to the creditworthiness of our counterparty.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities includes interest-bearing cash collateral held related to derivatives and other accrued liabilities. Due to its short-term nature, the carrying value of Other liabilities reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n157\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values, as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy, of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nTable 89: Additional Fair Value Information Related to Other Financial Instruments\nThe aggregate fair values in Table 89 represent only a portion of the total market value of our assets and liabilities as, in accordance with the guidance related to fair values about financial instruments, we exclude the following:\n•\nfinancial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (as they are disclosed in Table 83),\n•\ninvestments accounted for under the equity method,\n•\nequity securities without a readily determinable fair value that apply for the alternative measurement approach to fair value under ASU 2016-01,\n•\nreal and personal property,\n•\nlease financing,\n•\nloan customer relationships,\n•\ndeposit customer intangibles,\n•\nmortgage servicing rights (MSRs),\n•\nretail branch networks,\n•\nfee-based businesses, such as asset management and brokerage,\n•\ntrademarks and brand names,\n•\ntrade receivables and payables due in one year or less,\n•\ndeposit liabilities with no defined or contractual maturities under ASU 2016-01, and\n•\ninsurance contracts.\n158\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nN\nOTE\n16\nF\nINANCIAL\nD\nERIVATIVES\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risks inherent in our business activities, as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities. We manage these risks as part of our overall asset and liability management process and through our credit policies and procedures. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.\nDerivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not recorded on the balance sheet. The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract. The underlying is a referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread or other index. Residential and commercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us:\nTable 90: Total Gross Derivatives (a)\n(a)\nCentrally cleared derivatives are settled in cash daily and result in no derivative asset or derivative liability being recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)\nIncluded in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(c)\nIncluded in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(d)\nRepresents primarily swaps.\n(e)\nIncludes both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.\n(f)\nFutures contracts are settled in cash daily and result in no derivative asset or derivative liability being recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n159\nAll derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features section of this Note 16. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives. Further discussion on how derivatives are accounted for is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies.\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\nCertain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives to be recognized in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings impact of the hedged items.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. For these cash flow hedges, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps and forward contracts are recorded in AOCI and are then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line as the hedged cash flows.\nIn the 12 months that follow December 31, 2020, we expect to reclassify net derivative gains of $\n276\nmillion pretax, or $\n213\nmillion after-tax, from AOCI to interest income for both cash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is\nten years\n.\n160\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nFurther detail regarding gains (losses) related to our fair value and cash flow hedge derivatives is presented in the following table:\nTable 91: Gains (Losses) Recognized on Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges in the Consolidated Income Statement  (a) (b)\n(a)\nFor all periods presented, there were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for any of the fair value or cash flow hedge strategies.\n(b)\nAll cash flow and fair value hedge derivatives were interest rate contracts for the periods presented.\n(c)\nIncludes an insignificant amount of fair value hedge adjustments related to discontinued hedge relationships.\n(d)\nFor all periods presented, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to income because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.\nDetail regarding the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the carrying value of the hedged items is presented in the following table:\nTable 92: Hedged Items - Fair Value Hedges\n(a)\nIncludes $(\n0.1\n) billion and $(\n0.3\n) billion of fair value hedge adjustments primarily related to discontinued borrowed funds hedge relationships at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b)\nCarrying value shown represents amortized cost.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were\nno\ncomponents of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for all periods presented. Net gains (losses) on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were $(\n24\n) million at both 2020 and 2019  and $\n76\nmillion in 2018.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n161\nDerivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments\nResidential mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market, and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the loans and commitments due to interest rate risk are hedged with forward contracts to sell mortgage-backed securities, as well as U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options. Gains and losses on the loans and commitments held for sale and the derivatives used to economically hedge them are included in Residential mortgage noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nResidential mortgage servicing rights are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value influenced primarily by changes in interest rates. Derivatives used to hedge the fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-backed securities. Gains and losses on residential mortgage servicing rights and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in Residential mortgage noninterest income.\nCommercial mortgage loans held for sale and the related loan commitments, which are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives used to economically hedge these loans and commitments from changes in fair value due to interest rate risk include forward loan sale contracts and interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on the commitments, loans and derivatives are included in Other noninterest income. Derivatives used to economically hedge the change in value of commercial mortgage servicing rights include interest rate futures, swaps and options. Gains or losses on these derivatives are included in Corporate services noninterest income.\nThe residential and commercial mortgage loan commitments associated with loans to be sold which are accounted for as derivatives are valued based on the estimated fair value of the underlying loan and the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment. The fair value also takes into account the fair value of the embedded servicing right.\nWe offer derivatives to our customers in connection with their risk management needs. These derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions and foreign exchange contracts. We primarily manage our market risk exposure from customer transactions by entering into a variety of hedging transactions with third-party dealers. Gains and losses on customer-related derivatives are included in Other noninterest income.\nIncluded in the customer, mortgage banking risk management, and other risk management portfolios are written interest-rate caps and floors entered into with customers and for risk management purposes. We receive an upfront premium from the counterparty and are obligated to make payments to the counterparty if the underlying market interest rate rises above or falls below a certain level designated in the contract. Our ultimate obligation under written options is based on future market conditions.\nWe have entered into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. The notional amount of risk participation agreements sold was $\n7.0\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n8.0\nbillion at December 31, 2019. Assuming all underlying third party customers referenced in the swap contracts defaulted, the exposure from these agreements would be $\n0.5\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n0.3\nbillion at December 31, 2019 based on the fair value of the underlying swaps.\nFurther detail regarding the gains (losses) on derivatives not designated in hedging relationships is presented in the following table:\nTable 93: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives Not Designated for Hedging\n(a)\nIncluded in Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.\n(b)\nIncluded in Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.\n162\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nOffsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features\nWe generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party’s net position. In certain cases, minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any collateral is exchanged. Collateral is typically exchanged daily on unsettled positions based on the net fair value of the positions with the counterparty as of the preceding day. Collateral representing initial margin, which is based on potential future exposure, is also required to be pledged by us in relation to derivative instruments with central clearing house counterparties. Any cash collateral exchanged with counterparties under these master netting agreements is also netted, when appropriate, against the applicable derivative fair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, the fair value of any securities held or pledged is not included in the net presentation on the balance sheet. In order for derivative instruments under a master netting agreement to be eligible for closeout netting under GAAP, we must conduct sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis that the offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement would be legally enforceable upon an event of default, including upon an event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding of the counterparty. Enforceability is evidenced by a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in such circumstances.\nTable 94 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.\nTable 94 includes over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and OTC derivatives cleared through a central clearing house. OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or directly cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by the ISDA documentation or other legally enforceable master netting agreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. OTC cleared derivative instruments are typically settled in cash each day based on the prior day value.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n163\nTable 94: Derivative Assets and Liabilities Offsetting\n(a)\nRepresents the net amount of derivative assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(b)\nRepresents the net amount of derivative liabilities included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.\nAt December 31, 2020, we held cash, U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling $\n2.3\nbillion under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $\n1.9\nbillion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise, securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet.\nCertain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on December 31, 2020 was $\n1.6\nbillion for which we had posted collateral of $\n1.4\nbillion in the normal course of business. The maximum additional amount of collateral we would have been required\n164\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nto post if the credit-risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2020 would be $\n0.2\nbillion.\nN\nOTE\n17\nE\nMPLOYEE\nB\nENEFIT\nP\nLANS\nPension and Postretirement Plans\nWe have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Earnings credit percentages for those employees who were plan participants on December 31, 2009 are frozen at the level earned to that point. Earnings credits for all employees who became participants on or after January 1, 2010 are a flat\n3\n% of eligible compensation. All plan participants earn interest credits on their cash balances based on 30-year Treasury securities rates with those who were participants at December 31, 2009 earning a minimum rate. New participants on or after January 1, 2010 are not subject to the minimum rate. Beginning in 2018, the plan provides for a minimum annual earnings credit amount of $\n2,000\n, subject to eligibility criteria. Pension contributions to the plan are typically based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. Assets of the qualified pension plan are held in a separate Trust.\nWe also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension plan is unfunded. Contributions from PNC and, in the case of the postretirement benefit plans, participant contributions cover all benefits paid under the nonqualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plans. The postretirement plan provides benefits to certain retirees that are at least actuarially equivalent to those provided by Medicare Part D and accordingly, we receive a federal subsidy. PNC has established a VEBA to partially fund postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligations.\nWe use a measurement date of December 31 for plan assets and benefit obligations.\nThe qualified pension plan assets and benefit obligation were re-measured as of January 31, 2019 as a result of a plan amendment.\nA reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation for qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans as well as the change in plan assets for the qualified pension plan follows\n:\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n165\nTable 95: Reconciliation of Changes in Projected Benefit Obligation and Change in Plan Assets\n(a)\nThe actuarial (gains)/losses and changes in assumptions in 2020 and 2019 were primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation.\nPNC Pension Plan Assets\nThe long-term investment strategy for pension plan assets in our qualified pension plan (the Plan) is to:\n•\nMeet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries;\n•\nCover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust and the Plan;\n•\nProvide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis; and\n•\nProvide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment return, at an appropriate level of risk.\nThe Plan’s named investment fiduciary has the ability to make short to intermediate term asset allocation shifts under the dynamic asset allocation strategy based on factors such as the Plan’s funded status, the named investment fiduciary’s view of return on equities relative to long term expectations, the named investment fiduciary’s view on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads, and other relevant financial or economic factors which would be expected to impact the ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to participants and beneficiaries. Accordingly, the allowable asset allocation ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility required by the dynamic allocation policy.\n166\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe asset strategy allocations for the Plan at the end of 2020 and 2019, and the target allocation range at the end of 2020, by asset category, are as follows.\nTable 96: Asset Strategy Allocations\nThe asset category represents the allocation of Plan assets in accordance with the investment objective of each of the Plan’s investment managers. Certain domestic equity investment managers utilize derivatives and fixed income securities as described in their Investment Management Agreements to achieve their investment objective under the Investment Policy Statement. Other investment managers may invest in eligible securities outside of their assigned asset category to meet their investment objectives. The actual percentage of the fair value of total Plan assets held as of December 31, 2020 for equity securities, fixed income securities, real estate and all other assets are\n61\n%,\n21\n%,\n5\n% and\n13\n%, respectively.\nWe believe that, over the long term, asset allocation is the single greatest determinant of risk. Asset allocation will deviate from the target percentages due to market movement, cash flows, investment manager performance and implementation of shifts under the dynamic asset allocation policy. Material deviations from the asset allocation targets can alter the expected return and risk of the Trust. However, frequent rebalancing of the asset allocation targets may result in significant transaction costs, which can impair the Trust’s ability to meet its investment objective. Accordingly, the Trust portfolio is periodically rebalanced to maintain asset allocation within the target ranges described above.\nIn addition to being diversified across asset classes, the Trust is diversified within each asset class. Secondary diversification provides a reasonable basis for the expectation that no single security or class of securities will have a disproportionate impact on the total risk and return of the Trust.\nWhere investment strategies permit the use of derivatives and/or currency management, language is incorporated in the managers’ guidelines to define allowable and prohibited transactions and/or strategies. Derivatives are typically employed by investment managers to modify risk/return characteristics of their portfolio(s), implement asset allocation changes in a cost effective manner, or reduce transaction costs. Under the managers’ investment guidelines, derivatives may not be used solely for speculation or leverage. Derivatives are to be used only in circumstances where they offer the most efficient economic means of improving the risk/reward profile of the portfolio.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n167\nFair Value Measurements\nAs further described in Note 15 Fair Value, GAAP establishes the framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value.\nA description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 follows:\nThese methods may result in fair value calculations that may not be indicative of net realizable values or future fair values. Furthermore, while the pension plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan’s assets at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 97: Pension Plan Assets - Fair Value Hierarchy\n(a)\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n168\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table provides information regarding our estimated future cash flows related to our various plans.\nTable 98: Estimated Cash Flows\nThe qualified pension plan contributions are deposited into the Trust, and the qualified pension plan benefit payments are paid from the Trust. We do not expect to be required to make a contribution to the qualified plan for 2021 based on the funding calculations under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. For the other plans, total contributions and the benefit payments are the same and represent expected benefit amounts, which are paid from general assets. Postretirement benefits are net of participant contributions. Estimated cash flows reflect the partial funding of postretirement medical and life insurance obligations in the VEBA.\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost/(income) and other amounts recognized in OCI were as follows:\nTable 99: Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost (a)\n(a)     The service cost component is included in Personnel expense on the Consolidated Income Statement. All other components are included in Other noninterest expense on the Consolidated Income Statement.\n(b)    Includes the effects of the qualified pension plan remeasurement as of January 31, 2019 as a result of a plan amendment.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n169\nThe weighted-average assumptions used (as of the beginning of each year) to determine the net periodic costs shown in Table 99 were as follows:\nTable 100: Net Periodic Costs - Assumptions\n(a)\nThe 2019 qualified pension discount rate was\n4.15\n% at the time of remeasurement on January 31, 2019 as a result of a plan amendment.\n(b)\nRate disclosed is for the qualified pension plan.\n(c)\nRate is applicable only to the postretirement benefit plan.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used (as of the end of each year) to determine year end obligations for pension and postretirement benefits were as follows:\nTable 101: Other Pension Assumptions\n(a)\nRate disclosed is for the qualified pension plan.\n(b)\nRate is applicable only to the postretirement benefit plans.\nThe discount rates are determined independently for each plan by comparing the expected future benefits that will be paid under each plan with yields available on high quality corporate bonds of similar duration. For this analysis,\n10\n% of bonds with the highest yields and\n40\n% with the lowest yields were removed from the bond universe.\nThe expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes. For purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption, “long-term” refers to the period over which the plan’s projected benefit obligations will be disbursed. We review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted. Our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment, but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations. We also examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies. Taking into account all of these factors, the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2020 was\n5.50\n%. We are reducing our expected long-term return on assets to\n4.55\n% for determining pension cost for 2021. This decision was made after considering the views of both internal and external capital market advisors, particularly with regard to the effects of the recent economic environment on long-term prospective equity and fixed income returns.\n170\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nWith all other assumptions held constant, a\n0.50\n% decline in the discount rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in net periodic benefit cost in 2020 and to be recognized in 2021 for each of the qualified pension, nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe ISP is a qualified defined contribution plan that covers all of our eligible employees. Newly-hired full time employees and part-time employees who are eligible to participate in the ISP are automatically enrolled in the ISP with a deferral rate equal to\n4\n% of eligible compensation in the absence of an affirmative election otherwise. Employee benefits expense related to the ISP was $\n147\nmillion in 2020, $\n139\nmillion in 2019 and $\n139\nmillion in 2018, representing cash contributed to the ISP by PNC.\nThe ISP is a 401(k) Plan and includes an employee stock ownership feature. Employee contributions are invested in a number of investment options, including pre-mixed portfolios and individual core funds, available under the ISP at the direction of the employee.\nN\nOTE\n18\nS\nTOCK\nB\nASED\nC\nOMPENSATION\nP\nLANS\nWe have long-term incentive award plans (Incentive Plans) that provide for the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, incentive shares/performance units, restricted share units, other share-based awards and dollar-denominated awards to executives and, other than incentive stock options, to non-employee directors. Certain Incentive Plan awards may be paid in stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash. We typically grant a substantial portion of our stock-based compensation awards during the first quarter of each year.\nIncentive/Performance Share Unit Awards and Restricted Share Unit Awards\nThe fair value of nonvested incentive/performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock on the date of grant with a reduction for estimated forfeitures. The value of certain incentive/performance unit awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals. Additionally, certain incentive/performance unit awards could require subsequent adjustment due to certain discretionary risk review triggers.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of incentive/performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n150.23\n, $\n117.53\nand $\n149.38\nper share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of incentive/performance share unit awards and restricted share unit awards vested during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $\n213\nmillion, $\n218\nmillion and $\n254\nmillion, respectively. We recognize compensation expense for such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or performance periods for each type of program.\nA rollforward of the nonvested incentive/performance share unit and restricted share unit awards follows:\nTable 102: Nonvested Incentive/Performance Share Unit Awards and Restricted Share Unit Awards - Rollforward\n(a)\nIncludes adjustments for achieving specific performance goals for Incentive/Performance Unit Share Awards granted in prior periods.\nIn Table 102, the units and related weighted-average grant date fair value of the incentive/performance unit share awards exclude the effect of dividends on the underlying shares, as those dividends will be paid in cash if and when the underlying shares are issued to the participants.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n171\nN\nOTE\n19\nI\nNCOME\nT\nAXES\nThe components of income tax expense from continuing operations are as follows:\nTable 103: Components of Income Tax Expense\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nTable 104: Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n172\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nA reconciliation between the statutory and effective tax rates from continuing operations follows:\nTable 105: Reconciliation of Statutory and Effective Tax Rates\nThe net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2020 and 2019 follow\n:\nTable 106: Net Operating Loss Carryforwards\nThe majority of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2039 and were $\n58\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n149\nmillion at December 31, 2019. Some federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are from acquired entities and utilization is subject to various statutory limitations. We anticipate that we will be able to fully utilize our carryforwards for federal tax purposes, but we have recorded an insignificant valuation allowance against certain state tax carryforwards as of December 31, 2020.\nRetained earnings included $\n0.1\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 in allocations for bad debt deductions of former thrift subsidiaries for which no income tax has been provided. Under current law, if certain subsidiaries use these bad debt reserves for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses, they will be subject to Federal income tax at the current corporate tax rate.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nTable 107: Change in Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nWe do not expect that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the next twelve months.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in most states and some foreign jurisdictions. Table 108 summarizes the status of significant IRS examinations.\nTable 108: IRS Tax Examination Status\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n173\nIn addition, we are under continuous examinations by various state taxing authorities. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local and foreign income tax examinations by taxing authorities for periods before\n2013\n. For all open audits, any potential adjustments have been considered in establishing our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020.\nOur policy is to classify interest and penalties associated with income taxes as income tax expense. For 2020 and 2019, the amount of gross interest and penalties was insignificant. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related amounts of accrued interest and penalties were also insignificant.\nN\nOTE\n20\nR\nEGULATORY\nM\nATTERS\nWe are subject to the regulations of certain federal, state and foreign agencies and undergo periodic examinations by such regulatory authorities.\nThe ability to undertake new business initiatives (including acquisitions), the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to pay dividends, the ability to repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s capital strength.\nAs of January 1, 2020, the 2019 Tailoring Rules became effective for PNC. The most significant changes involve the election to exclude specific AOCI items from CET1 capital and higher thresholds used to calculate CET1 capital deductions.\nOn March 27, 2020, the regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule delaying the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming\nfrom implementing the CECL standard. The estimated CECL impact is added to CET1 through December 31, 2021, then phased-out over the following three years. PNC and PNC Bank have elected the five-year transition period effective March 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, PNC and PNC Bank, our domestic banking subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements.\nThe following table sets forth the Basel III regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2020 and 2019, for PNC and PNC Bank:\nTable 109: Basel Regulatory Capital (a)\n(a)\nCalculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during both 2020 and 2019.\nThe principal source of parent company cash flow is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:\n•\nCapital needs,\n•\nLaws and regulations,\n•\nCorporate policies,\n•\nContractual restrictions, and\n•\nOther factors.\nAlso, there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of national banks to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. The amount available for dividend payments to the parent company by PNC Bank without prior regulatory approval was approximately $\n3.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020.\nUnder federal law, a bank subsidiary generally may not extend credit to, or engage in other types of covered transactions (including the purchase of assets) with, the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries on terms and under circumstances that are not\n174\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nsubstantially the same as comparable transactions with nonaffiliates. A bank subsidiary may not extend credit to, or engage in a covered transaction with, the parent company or a non-bank subsidiary if the aggregate amount of the bank’s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the parent company or non-bank subsidiary exceeds 10% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary or the aggregate amount of the bank’s extensions of credit and other covered transactions with the parent company and all non-bank subsidiaries exceeds 20% of the capital stock and surplus of such bank subsidiary. Such extensions of credit, with limited exceptions, must be at least fully collateralized in accordance with specified collateralization thresholds, with the thresholds varying based on the type of assets serving as collateral. In certain circumstances, federal regulatory authorities may impose more restrictive limitations.\nAt December 31, 2020, the balance outstanding at the Federal Reserve Bank was $\n84.9\nbillion.\nN\nOTE\n21\nL\nEGAL\nP\nROCEEDINGS\nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are those matters disclosed in this Note 21). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of December 31, 2020, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount less than $\n100\nmillion. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.\nIn our experience, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. One or more of the following factors frequently contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if permitted to proceed as a class action, how the class will be defined; the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, the possibility of fines and penalties); the matter presents meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; we have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions; discovery has not started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; the possible outcomes may not be amenable to the use of statistical or quantitative analytical tools; predicting possible outcomes depends on making assumptions about future decisions of courts or regulatory bodies or the behavior of other parties; and there are a large number of parties named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants). Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we could incur.\nAs a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under “Other.”\nWe include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff’s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff’s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.\nSome of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n175\nInterchange Litigation\nBeginning in June 2005, a series of antitrust lawsuits were filed against Visa®, Mastercard®, and several major financial institutions, including cases naming National City (since merged into The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.) and its subsidiary, National City Bank of Kentucky (since merged into National City Bank which in turn was merged into PNC Bank). The plaintiffs in these cases are merchants operating commercial businesses throughout the U.S., as well as trade associations. Some of these cases (including those naming National City entities) were brought as class actions on behalf of all persons or business entities that have accepted Visa or Mastercard. The cases have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption\nIn re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation\n(Master File No. 1:05-md-1720- MKB-JO).\nIn July 2012, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding with the class plaintiffs and an agreement in principle with certain individual plaintiffs with respect to a settlement of these cases, under which the defendants agreed to pay approximately $\n6.6\nbillion collectively to the class and individual settling plaintiffs and agreed to changes in the terms applicable to their respective card networks (including an eight-month reduction in default credit interchange rates). The parties entered into a definitive agreement with respect to this settlement in October 2012. The court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2013. Several objectors appealed the order of approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an order in June 2016, reversing approval of the settlement and remanding for further proceedings. In November 2016, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge the court of appeal’s decision. The Supreme Court denied the petition in March 2017.\nAs a result of the reversal of the approval of the settlement, the class actions have resumed in the district court. In November 2016, the district court appointed separate interim class counsel for a proposed class seeking damages and a proposed class seeking equitable (injunctive) relief. In February 2017, each of these counsel filed a proposed amended and supplemental complaint on behalf of its respective proposed class. These complaints make similar allegations, including that the defendants conspired to monopolize and to fix the prices for general purpose card network services, that the restructuring of Visa and Mastercard, each of which included an initial public offering, violated the antitrust laws, and that the defendants otherwise imposed unreasonable restraints on trade, resulting in the payment of inflated interchange fees and other fees, which also violated the antitrust laws. In their complaints, collectively the plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (trebled under the antitrust laws) and attorneys’ fees. PNC is named as a defendant in the complaint seeking damages but is not named as a defendant in the complaint that seeks equitable relief.\nIn September 2017, the magistrate judge at the district court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ motions to file their proposed amended complaints. The dispute over amendment arose in part from the decision in\nUnited States v. American Express, Co.,\n838 F.3d 179\n(2d Cir. 2016), in which the court held that the relevant market in a similar complaint against American Express is “two-sided,”\ni.e\n., requires consideration of effects on consumers as well as merchants. In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed (under the caption\nOhio v. American Express Co.\n) the court of appeals decision\n.\nPreviously, the plaintiffs in this litigation had alleged a one-sided market, and, as a result of the court’s decision in\nAmerican Express\n, they sought leave to add claims based on a two-sided market. The order allowed the complaint to be amended to include allegations pertaining to a two-sided market only to the extent those claims are not time-barred, but held that the two-sided market allegations do not relate back to the time of the original complaint and are not subject to tolling. In October 2017, the plaintiffs appealed this order to the presiding district court judge. In August 2018, the judge overruled this decision, finding that the two-sided market allegations do relate back.\nIn September 2018, the relevant parties entered an amended definitive agreement to resolve the claims of the class seeking damages. In this amended settlement agreement, the parties agreed, among other things, to the following terms:\n•\nAn additional settlement payment from all defendants of $\n900\nmillion, with Visa’s share of the additional settlement payment being $\n600\nmillion. The additional settlement payment will be added to the approximately $\n5.3\nbillion previously paid by the defendants pursuant to the original 2012 settlement agreement.\n•\nUp to $\n700\nmillion may be returned to the defendants (with up to $\n467\nmillion to Visa) if more than\n15\n% of class members (by payment volume) opt out of the class. As more than\n15\n% of class members opted out of the class, $\n700\nmillion has been returned to the defendants ($\n467\nmillion to Visa).\nThis amended settlement agreement is subject to court approval. Following preliminary approval in January 2019, and after class notice, the submission of opt-outs, and the filing of objections, the district court granted final approval of the settlement in December 2019. Several objectors have appealed the district court’s order granting final approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Some merchants that opted out from the settlement have brought lawsuits against Visa and Mastercard and one or more of the issuing banks. Resolution by Visa of claims by merchants that opted out of the settlement, including those that file lawsuits, have been or will be paid from the Visa litigation escrow account.\n176\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nNational City and National City Bank entered into judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks with respect to all of the above referenced litigation. We were not originally named as defendants in any of the Visa or Mastercard related antitrust litigation nor were we initially parties to the judgment or loss sharing agreements. However, we became responsible for National City’s and National City Bank’s position in the litigation and responsibilities under the agreements through our acquisition of National City. In addition, following Visa’s reorganization in 2007 in contemplation of its initial public offering, U.S. Visa members received shares of Class B Visa common stock, convertible upon resolution of specified litigation, including the remaining litigation described above, into shares of Class A Visa common stock, with the conversion rate adjusted to reflect amounts paid or escrowed to resolve the specified litigation, and also remained responsible for indemnifying Visa against the specified litigation. Our Class B Visa common stock is all subject to this conversion adjustment provision, and we are now responsible for the indemnification obligations of our predecessors as well as ourselves. We have also entered into a Mastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement with Mastercard and other financial institution defendants and an Omnibus Agreement Regarding Interchange Litigation Sharing and Settlement Sharing with Visa, Mastercard and other financial institution defendants. The Omnibus Agreement, in substance, apportions resolution of the claims in this litigation into a Visa portion and a Mastercard portion, with the Visa portion being two-thirds and the Mastercard portion being one-third. This apportionment only applies in the case of either a global settlement involving all defendants or an adverse judgment against the defendants, to the extent that damages either are related to the merchants’ inter-network conspiracy claims or are otherwise not attributed to specific Mastercard or Visa conduct or damages. The Mastercard portion (or any Mastercard-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will then be apportioned under the Mastercard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement among Mastercard and PNC and the other financial institution defendants that are parties to this agreement. The responsibility for the Visa portion (or any Visa-related liability not subject to the Omnibus Agreement) will be apportioned under the pre-existing indemnification responsibilities and judgment and loss sharing agreements.\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities Indemnification Demands\nWe have received indemnification demands from several entities sponsoring residential mortgage-backed securities and their affiliates where purchasers of the securities, trustees for the securitization trusts, or monoline insurers have asserted claims against the sponsors and other parties involved in the securitization transactions. National City Mortgage and its predecessors had sold to the sponsors or their affiliates whole loans that were allegedly included in certain of these securitization transactions. According to the indemnification demands, the claims for which indemnity is being sought are based on alleged misstatements and omissions in the offering documents for these transactions or breaches of representations and warranties relating to the loans made in connection with the transactions. The indemnification demands assert that agreements governing the sale of these loans or the securitization transactions to which National City Mortgage was a party require us to indemnify the sponsors and their affiliates for losses suffered in connection with these claims.\nThe parties have settled several of these disputes. In February 2020, one of the entities asserting a right to indemnification submitted a demand for our purported share of the settlement amount of claims asserted against it and its affiliates. The portion of the settlement amount, if any, for which we are responsible in the settled cases has not been determined.\nPre-need Funeral Arrangements\nNational City Bank and PNC Bank are defendants in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri under the caption\nJo Ann Howard and Associates, P.C., et al. v. Cassity, et al.\n(No. 4:09-CV-1252-ERW) arising out of trustee services provided by Allegiant Bank, a National City Bank and PNC Bank predecessor, with respect to Missouri trusts that held pre-need funeral contract assets. Under a pre-need funeral contract, a customer pays an amount up front in exchange for payment of funeral expenses following the customer’s death. In a number of states, including Missouri, pre-need funeral contract sellers are required to deposit a portion of the proceeds of the sale of pre-need funeral contracts in a trust account.\nThe lawsuit was filed in August 2009 by the Special Deputy Receiver for three insolvent affiliated companies, National Prearranged Services, Inc. a seller of pre-need funeral contracts (NPS), Lincoln Memorial Life Insurance Company (Lincoln), and Memorial Service Life Insurance Company (Memorial). Seven individual state life and health insurance guaranty associations, who claim they are liable under state law for payment of certain benefits under life insurance policies sold by Lincoln and Memorial, and the National Organization of Life & Health Guaranty Associations have also joined the action as plaintiffs. In addition to National City Bank and PNC Bank (added following filing of the lawsuit as successor-in-interest to National City Bank) (the PNC defendants), other defendants included members of the Cassity family, who controlled NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; officers and directors of NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; auditors and attorneys for NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial; the trustees of each of the trusts that held pre-need funeral contract assets; and the investment advisor to the Pre-need Trusts. NPS retained several banks to act as trustees for the trusts holding NPS pre-need funeral contract assets (the NPS Trusts), with Allegiant Bank acting as one of these trustees with respect to seven Missouri NPS Trusts. All of the other defendants have settled with the plaintiffs, are otherwise no longer a party to the lawsuit, or are insolvent.\nIn their Third Amended Complaint, filed in 2012 following the granting by the court in part of motions to dismiss made by the PNC defendants and the other NPS Trust trustees, the plaintiffs allege that Allegiant Bank breached its fiduciary duties and acted\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n177\nnegligently as the trustee for the Missouri NPS Trusts. In part as a result of these breaches, the plaintiffs allege, members of the Cassity family, acting in concert with other defendants, were able to improperly remove millions of dollars from the NPS Trusts, which in turn caused NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial to become insolvent. The complaint alleges $\n600\nmillion in present and future losses to the plaintiffs due to the insolvency of NPS, Lincoln, and Memorial. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, unspecified actual and punitive damages, various equitable remedies including restitution, attorneys’ fees, costs of suit and interest.\nIn July 2013, five of the six defendants in a parallel federal criminal action, including two members of the Cassity family, entered into plea agreements with the U.S. to resolve criminal charges arising out of their conduct at NPS, Lincoln and Memorial. In August 2013, after a jury trial, the sixth defendant, the investment advisor to the NPS Trusts, was convicted on all criminal counts against him. The criminal charges against the defendants alleged, among other thing, a scheme to defraud Allegiant Bank and the other trustees of the NPS Trusts.\nIn May 2014, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to disallow the PNC defendants’ affirmative defense relating to the plaintiffs’ alleged failure to mitigate damages. In July 2014, the PNC defendants’ motion for reconsideration was denied. In September 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint to reassert aiding and abetting claims, previously dismissed by the court in 2012. The court denied this motion in December 2014. Also in December 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the PNC defendants’ motion for summary judgment.\nIn March 2015, following a jury trial, the court entered a judgment against the PNC defendants in the amount of $\n356\nmillion in compensatory damages and $\n36\nmillion in punitive damages. In April 2015, the plaintiffs filed motions with the court seeking $\n179\nmillion in pre-judgment interest. Also, in April 2015, the PNC defendants filed motions with the court to reduce the compensatory damages by the amounts paid in settlement by other defendants, to strike the punitive damages award, for judgment as a matter of law, and for a new trial. In November 2015, the court granted the motion to reduce the compensatory damages by amounts paid in settlement by other defendants and denied the other motions by the PNC defendants, with the judgment being reduced as a result to a total of $\n289\nmillion, and also denied the plaintiffs’ motion for pre-judgment interest.\nIn December 2015, the PNC defendants appealed the judgment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Also in December 2015, the plaintiffs cross-appealed from the court’s orders reducing the judgment by amounts paid in settlement by other defendants, denying plaintiffs’ motion for pre-judgment interest, and dismissing the plaintiffs’ aiding and abetting claims. In August 2017, the court of appeals reversed the judgment to the extent that it was based on tort rather than trust law. The court accordingly held that any damages awarded to the plaintiff will be limited to losses to the trusts in Missouri caused by Allegiant’s breaches during the time it acted as trustee; plaintiffs cannot recover for damages to the Missouri trusts after Allegiant’s trusteeship or outside of the Missouri trusts, which had been included in the judgment under appeal. The court of appeals otherwise affirmed the judgment, including the dismissal of the aiding and abetting claims, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings in light of its decision.\nIn September 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing by the panel solely seeking to remove the prohibition on damages being sought for the period following Allegiant’s trusteeship. In December 2017, the court denied the petition for rehearing. In July 2019, following a new trial on remand from the court of appeals, the district court awarded the plaintiffs $\n72\nmillion in compensatory damages, $\n15\nmillion in interest, and $\n15\nmillion in punitive damages. The PNC defendants have appealed this judgment to the court of appeals, and the plaintiffs cross-appealed. In December 2019, the court reduced the judgment by approximately $\n2.6\nmillion to correct a mathematical error in calculating pre-judgment interest, reducing the total judgment to $\n99.5\nmillion. In March 2020, the court dismissed the plaintiffs’ cross-appeal on the plaintiffs’ motion\n.\nIn February 2020, the district court awarded $\n7\nmillion in fees and costs to the plaintiffs, and the PNC defendants have appealed this judgment to the court of appeals.

PNC Bank N.A., Case No. 2:20-cv-319\n) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against PNC Bank for patent infringement. The plaintiff amended its complaint in December 2020. As amended, the complaint alleges that PNC’s mobile remote deposit capture systems infringe on four patents owned by the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeks, among other things, a judgment that PNC is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. In December 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, and in January 2021, we filed a motion to transfer the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Trial in this matter is presently scheduled to commence on March 7, 2022.\nIn December 2020, we filed a lawsuit (\nPNC Bank, N.A. v.

In some cases, these inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. From time to time, these inquiries have involved and may in the future involve or lead to regulatory enforcement actions and other administrative proceedings. These inquiries have also led to and may in the future lead to civil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some of these inquiries result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. Such remedies and other consequences typically have not been material to us from a financial standpoint, but could be in the future. Even if not financially material, they may result in significant reputational harm or other adverse consequences.\nAs has been publicly reported, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an inquiry relating to the federal LIHTC program directed at program participants. In connection with that inquiry, the Department of Justice requested information from PNC Bank, and we cooperated in that inquiry.\nOur practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including that described in this Note 21.\nOther\nIn addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n179\nN\nOTE\n22\nP\nARENT\nC\nOMPANY\nSummarized financial information of the parent company is as follows:\nTable 110: Parent Company - Income Statement\n180\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nTable 111: Parent Company - Balance Sheet\n(a)\nSee Note 10 Borrowed Funds for additional information on contractual rates and maturity dates of senior debt and subordinated debt for parent company.\nIn connection with certain affiliates’ commercial and residential mortgage servicing operations, the parent company has committed to maintain such affiliates’ net worth above minimum requirements.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n181\nTable 112: Parent Company - Interest Paid and Income Tax Refunds (Payments)\nTable 113: Parent Company - Statement of Cash Flows\nN\nOTE\n23\nS\nEGMENT\nR\nEPORTING\nWe have\nthree\nreportable business segments:\n•\nRetail Banking\n•\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\n•\nAsset Management Group\nResults of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we divested our entire\n22.4\n% investment in BlackRock, which had previously been reported as a separate business segment.

These differences are reflected in the “Other” category in the Table 114. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, ACL for investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, exited businesses, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP). The “Other” category also includes our BlackRock held for sale asset. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented for comparison.\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions within “Other” for financial reporting purposes.\nNet interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.\nWe have allocated ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments based on the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower and economic conditions.

The objective of the standard is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers across all industries and to develop a common revenue standard under GAAP. The standard requires the application of a five-step recognition model to contracts, allocating the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to across distinct promises in the contract, called performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when or as those services are transferred to the customer.\nFee-based revenue within the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within our\nthree\nreportable business segments, Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking and Asset Management Group.

May be settled either in cash or by delivery of the underlying financial instrument.\nHome price index (HPI)\n– A broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices in the U.S.\nInterest rate swap contracts\n– Contracts that are entered into primarily as an asset/liability management strategy to reduce interest rate risk. Interest rate swap contracts are exchanges of interest rate payments, such as fixed-rate payments for floating-rate payments, based on notional principal amounts.\nIntrinsic value\n– The difference between the price, if any, required to be paid for stock issued pursuant to an equity compensation arrangement and the fair market value of the underlying stock.\nLeverage ratio\n– Basel III Tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly adjusted total assets.\nLondon InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR)\n– LIBOR is the average interest rate charged when banks in the London wholesale money market (or interbank market) borrow unsecured funds from each other. LIBOR rates are used as a benchmark for interest rates on a global basis. Our product set includes loans priced using LIBOR as a benchmark.\nLoan-to-value ratio (LTV)\n– A calculation of a loan’s collateral coverage that is used both in underwriting and assessing credit risk in our lending portfolio. LTV is the sum total of loan obligations secured by collateral divided by the market value of that same collateral. Market value of the collateral is based on an independent valuation of the collateral. For example, a LTV of less than 90% is better secured and has less credit risk than a LTV of greater than or equal to 90%.\nLong run average\n– In the context of CECL, expected credit losses or credit risk parameters for the remaining estimated\ncontractual maturity beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods. The long run average is generally derived\nfrom historical loss information and current portfolio characteristics, without considering current or forecasted conditions.\nLoss given default (LGD)\n– Assuming a credit obligor enters default status, an estimate of loss, based on collateral type, collateral\nvalue, loan exposure and other factors. LGD is net of recovery, through any means, including but not limited to the liquidation of\ncollateral or deficiency judgments rendered from foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings.\nNonaccrual loans\n– Loans for which we do not accrue interest income. Nonaccrual loans include nonperforming loans, in addition to loans accounted for under fair value option and loans accounted for as held for sale for which full collection of contractual principal and/or interest is not probable.\nNondiscretionary client assets under administration\n– Assets we hold for our customers/clients in a nondiscretionary, custodial capacity. We do not include these assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNonperforming assets\n– Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans, OREO and foreclosed assets. We do not accrue interest income on assets classified as nonperforming.\nNonperforming loans\n– Loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable, including TDRs which have not returned to performing status. Interest income is not recognized on nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest, loans held for sale, and loans accounted for under the fair value option.\nNotional amount\n– The basis to which the underlying referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread or other index is applied to determine required payments under the derivative contract.\nOperating leverage\n– The period to period dollar or percentage change in total revenue less the dollar or percentage change in noninterest expense. A positive variance indicates that revenue growth exceeded expense growth (\ni.e.\n, positive operating leverage) while a negative variance implies expense growth exceeded revenue growth (\ni.e.\n, negative operating leverage).\nOptions\n– Contracts that grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase or sell the associated financial instrument at a set price during a specified period or at a specified date in the future.\nOther real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets\n– Assets taken in settlement of troubled loans primarily through deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or foreclosure. Foreclosed assets include real and personal property. Certain assets that have a government-guarantee which are classified as other receivables are excluded.\nPNC Bank\n– PNC Bank, National Association.\n198\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\nProbability of default (PD)\n– An estimate of the likelihood that a credit obligor will enter default status.\nPurchased credit deteriorated assets (PCD)\n– Acquired loans or debt securities that, at acquisition, are determined to have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance.\nReasonable and supportable forecast period\n– In the context of CECL, the period for which forecasts and projections of\nmacroeconomic variables have been determined to be reasonable and supportable, and are used as inputs for ACL measurement.\nRecovery\n– Cash proceeds received on a loan that we had previously charged-off. We credit the amount received to the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nReversion period\n– In the context of CECL, the period between the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and the point\nat which losses are expected to have reverted to their long run average, in order to reflect an overall reasonable estimate of expected\ncredit losses.\nRisk appetite\n– A dynamic, forward-looking view on the aggregate amount of risk we are willing and able to take in executing business strategy in light of the current business environment.\nRisk limits\n– Quantitative measures based on forward-looking assumptions that allocate our aggregate risk appetite (\ne.g.,\nmeasure of loss or negative events) to business lines, legal entities, specific risk categories, concentrations and as appropriate, other levels.\nRisk profile\n– The risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of risk. The profile represents overall risk position in relation to the desired risk appetite. The determination of the risk profile’s position is based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of reported risk limits, metrics, operating guidelines and qualitative assessments.\nRisk-weighted assets\n– Computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)\n- SOFR is a reference rate that is based on overnight transactions in the U.S. Treasury repurchase market.\nServicing rights\n– Intangible assets or liabilities created by an obligation to service assets for others. Typical servicing rights include the right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow.\nSupplementary leverage exposure\n- The sum of adjusted average assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including undrawn credit commitments and derivative potential future exposures.\nSupplementary leverage ratio\n– Basel III Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure.\nTaxable-equivalent interest income\n– The interest income earned on certain assets that is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. These tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of yields and margins for all interest-earning assets, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on other taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nTroubled debt restructuring (TDR)\n– A loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.\nUnfunded lending related commitments\n– Standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, commitments to extend credit and similar\nunfunded obligations that are not unilaterally, unconditionally, cancellable at PNC’s option.\nValue-at-risk (VaR)\n– A statistically-based measure of risk that describes the amount of potential loss which may be incurred due to adverse market movements. The measure is of the maximum loss which should not be exceeded on 95 out of 100 days for a 95% VaR.\nYield curve\n– A graph showing the relationship between the yields on financial instruments or market indices of the same credit quality with different maturities. For example, a “normal” or “positive” yield curve exists when long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds. A “flat” yield curve exists when yields are the same for short-term and long-term bonds. A “steep” yield curve exists when yields on long-term bonds are significantly higher than on short-term bonds. An “inverted” or “negative” yield curve exists when short-term bonds have higher yields than long-term bonds.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K\n199\nACRONYMS\n200\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –\n2020 Form 10-K"

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nWe performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that PNC maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Report, has also audited the effectiveness of PNC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.
