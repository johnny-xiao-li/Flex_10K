    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nQuest Diagnostics Incorporated is the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services.  We play a crucial role in the healthcare ecosystem, empowering people to take action to improve health outcomes.  Derived from the world's largest database of clinical lab results, our diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  In the right hands and with the right context, our diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives.\nQuest Diagnostics was incorporated in Delaware in 1990; its predecessor companies date back to 1967.  We conduct business through our headquarters in Secaucus, New Jersey, and our laboratories, patient service centers, offices and other facilities around the United States and in selected locations outside the United States.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Quest Diagnostics,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” mean Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe patients we serve comprise approximately one-third of the adult population of the United States annually, and approximately one-half of the adult population in the United States over a three-year period.  We estimate that annually we serve approximately half of the physicians and half of the hospitals in the United States.\nDuring 2020, we generated net revenues of $9.4 billion.  Additional financial information concerning Quest Diagnostics for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8.\nOur vision, aspirational goals and values are set forth below.\n2\nWe believe that our vision, aspirational goals and strategy align very well with, and our strong value proposition supports, the triple aim of healthcare: improving medical quality and the patient experience while reducing the cost of care.\nIn 2020, Quest Diagnostics was at the forefront of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, playing a pivotal role to broaden access to laboratory insights to help people lead healthier and safer lives.  We provided both molecular diagnostic and antibody serology tests to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the detection of immune response to the virus, and performed over 30 million of these tests.  Beginning in March 2020, we worked closely with federal, state and local governments, healthcare organizations, payers, suppliers, retailers, trade associations and other laboratories in the effort to bring as much COVID-19 testing as possible to the American people.  We also provided data on COVID-19 testing that we conducted to federal, state and local public health authorities, including the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and participated in studies with government and private institutions, aiding COVID-19 public health response and research.  All of our employees, including our dedicated laboratory professionals, phlebotomists, air fleet team, and couriers take tremendous pride in the role we played and worked tirelessly to help patients and communities access quality COVID-19 testing.\nDuring 2020, we also saw how underserved communities were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 with tragic consequences.  With the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, we launched Quest for Health Equity, a $100 million-plus initiative to reduce health disparities in underserved communities.  This multi-year initiative, which will focus on people of color, elderly and homeless populations in locations throughout the United States, will provide a combination of testing services, education programs, alliances and financial support to efforts seeking to find new ways to address health disparities.\nOur approach to fighting the pandemic has been rooted in our vision of empowering better health through diagnostic insights.  We believe that the challenges we are facing from the COVID-19 pandemic have brought us together, made us a stronger company and will help us capture the substantial opportunities in front of us.\nOUR STRATEGY\nWe have a two-point business strategy, reviewed by our Board of Directors, to achieve our vision and our goals.\n3\nAccelerate Growth\n1. Growing through acquisitions.\nWe have maintained a strategy since November 2018 to grow revenue each year by more than 2% compound annual growth rate through accretive, strategic acquisitions.  Although the merger and acquisition environment significantly slowed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to consummate important acquisitions during 2020.  Our approach to acquisitions is discussed below under the heading\nDeliver disciplined capital deployment\n.\n2. Partnering with health plans, IDNs and other risk bearing entities.\nTo help accelerate growth, we focus on large opportunities to partner with outside entities.  We strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by driving value with employers and providing strong value propositions for members and clinicians. This includes building an information platform to help health plans manage utilization and population health, and enhancing processes to help health plans keep laboratory testing in network.  For example, in 2020 we established a strategic relationship with Anthem to collaborate on a variety of outcomes-based programs designed to create an improved healthcare\n4\nexperience for consumers and healthcare providers, and we advanced our position with UnitedHealthcare in its Preferred Lab Network.\nWe believe that the growing market challenges faced by IDNs, including continued price transparency, cost and utilization pressure, evolving healthcare payment models, capital needs, changing technology and limited resources, provides us with an opportunity to more effectively partner with them as they consider their laboratory testing strategy and will drive demand for our expertise.   We have deployed a dedicated health systems team to strengthen our relationships with IDNs, including with respect to their reference testing.  We provide reference testing for approximately half of the hospitals in the U.S., and are the leading provider of this testing in the country.  In 2020, we logged a record amount of new Professional Laboratory Services business, representing larger and longer term agreements than in the past, and implemented new relationships with, among others, Memorial Hermann Health System, Hackensack Meridian Health, Montefiore Nyack Hospital and Goshen Hospital.\n3.\nOffering the broadest access to diagnostic innovation.\nOur diagnostic solutions deliver high clinical value to the medical community nationwide.  We create value through scientific and product innovation and solution delivery for major clinical opportunities.  Starting with a clinical focus on a specific disease state or clinical problem, we take advantage of advanced technology for more precise, comprehensive and actionable information, and deliver the information to the medical community in a meaningful way.  We make innovative diagnostic solutions available to community physicians through our connectivity solutions, operational footprint and by making complex results actionable.  We plan to expand our innovative diagnostic solutions through research and development, as well as partnerships with academic institutions, other technology and healthcare leaders and public health agencies.  In 2020, our approach delivered numerous innovations, including those discussed below under the headings \"Innovation\" (page 9), \"Collaboration\" (page 10), \"Medical and Scientific Expertise\" (page 10) and \"Health Information Technology Solutions and Information Assets\" (page 10).\nThe performance in 2020 of our Infectious Disease and Immunology franchise, which was leading our COVID-19 pandemic response, is an example of the power of our franchises.\n4.\nBeing recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of choice of diagnostic information services\n.  We are focused on the consumer.   The Company has a long history of focusing on consumer interests, and continues to focus on improving the consumer experience, including through improved digitization and other enhancements of our operations.   Examples of our strong consumer focus during 2020 include the strong growth in our QuestDirect\nTM\nconsumer-initiated testing and establishing special hours at our patient service centers for non-COVID-19 testing to accommodate the needs of older and highly vulnerable patients.  Our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores reflect our consumer focus.\n5\n5.\nSupporting population health with data analytics and extended care services.\nWe support population health by offering services (\ne.g\n., home-based health risk assessments and related services) designed to identify gaps in care in a population, provide clinical solutions to close the gaps and foster consumer engagement with a solution.  Our services help healthcare providers, health plans, sponsors and IDNs deliver better care to their patient populations by identifying and filling gaps in care for their patient populations and by enabling them to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals.  Our offerings leverage the power of our assets and capabilities (\ne.g\n., call centers; patient service centers; and mobile workforce, including professionals) and integrate our extensive clinical data, and include data analytics and extended care services.  For example, Quest Lab Stewardship\nTM\nemploys machine learning to help optimize laboratory test utilization.\n6\nDrive operational excellence\nImproving our operations will yield many benefits, including: enhancing customer experience; improving our quality and competitiveness; strengthening our foundation for growth; and increasing employee engagement and shareholder value.  We are building a superior experience, at lower cost, for all of our customers, including consumers, health plans, IDNs and clinicians.  We endeavor to improve our processes and effectiveness at the same time.  We are guided by a service dashboard that focuses throughout our operations on quality for consumers, healthcare providers and employees, including medical quality, on-time delivery, competitive costs and employee safety.\nDuring 2020, our focus on and strength in operational excellence enabled us to rapidly scale up COVID-19 testing capacity without sacrificing our other test offerings.  We also made\nstrong progress on our improvement initiatives.  For example, we  continued (i)\nconsolidating and simplifying our immunoassay platforms, moving to a single supplier to provide greater throughput, autonomy and a more efficient footprint and (ii) optimizing our lab network through investments in our new 250,000 square foot flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey, which we opened early in 2021 and will provide greater capacity, increased throughput and improved productivity.\nOur cost excellence program, Invigorate, includes structured plans to drive savings and improve performance across the value chain, including in such areas as revenue services, information technology and procurement.  We currently aim annually to save approximately 3% of our costs.  In 2020, we achieved our goal; our Invigorate program delivered approximately $200 million of cost savings.\nOUR STRENGTHS\nQuality\nOur goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality.  We strive to accomplish that through commitment, leadership, and establishing rigorous processes which we measure and continually seek to improve, and by using the Quest Management System, which provides best-in-class business performance tools to create and implement effective and sustainable quality processes.  The Quest Diagnostics Quality Program includes policies and procedures to document, measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements.  The Quality Program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to deliver superior quality care, identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems.  To help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry, we have implemented our Quality System Framework, which serves as a reference\n7\nguide for our employees and describes our Quality System Elements, which provide the structure for each laboratory to achieve and maintain quality processes.   We also have a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to ensure we have a high quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectations across that network.  Being chosen by UnitedHealthcare as a participant in the UnitedHealthcare Preferred Lab Network reflects the strength of our quality.  For additional information about our commitment to quality, see \"General - Quality Assurance\" on page 24.\nStrong operating principles\nWe have a foundation of three strong operating principles:\n•\nstrengthen organizational capabilities;\n•\nremain focused on diagnostic information services; and\n•\ndeliver disciplined capital deployment.\nStrengthen organizational capabilities.\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our organizational capabilities to support our two-point strategy, enable growth and productivity, better focus on our customers, speed decision-making and empower employees.  Highlights include:\n•\nAlign for Growth, Execution and Efficiency\n.  Our organization is designed to align around future growth opportunities, coordinate business units for seamless execution and leverage our company-wide infrastructure to gain more capability, value and efficiency. We relied on this organizational design to allow us to develop a  coordinated and sustained strategy to respond to the unprecedented challenges we face responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The value creation side of our business includes product and commercial marketing and is organized by clinical franchise and focuses on customer solutions for the marketplace, including new test development and diagnostic insights.  The value delivery side includes sales, laboratory operations, field operations, logistics and client services.\n•\nQuest Management System\n.  This system provides a foundation for day-to-day management, and includes best-in-class business performance tools to help develop new capabilities to improve our Company.  The system enables us to run the Company with a common language, approach and philosophy, and supports our efforts as we build a high-performance culture, with employees focused on behaviors to make us more agile, transparent, customer-focused, collaborative and performance oriented.\nRemain focused on diagnostic information services.\nWe maintain a sharp focus on providing diagnostic information services.\nDeliver disciplined capital deployment.\nOur disciplined capital deployment framework includes investment in our business, dividends and share repurchases.  The framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating.  We expect to return a majority of our free cash flow to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  Consistent with that expectation, in February 2021 we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock cash dividend by approximately 11%, from $0.56 per common share to $0.62 per common share.  This represents our tenth increase in the dividend since 2011.  For many years, we have maintained a common stock repurchase program.  Since the beginning of 2013, we have returned approximately $3.4 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock.  Our share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures in each of the last three years are presented in our consolidated financial statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Report).  For most of 2020, we suspended our share repurchase program due to the challenges and uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company's strategy includes generating growth through value-creating, strategically-aligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria.  We screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations, including value creation, return on invested capital and impact on our earnings.  In 2020, we consummated the acquisition of Blueprint Genetics, acquired substantially all the operations of Memorial Hermann Diagnostics Laboratories, the outreach laboratory division of Memorial Hermann Health System, and acquired from our joint venture partners the remaining 56% interest in Mid America Clinical Laboratories, LLC.  Our material acquisitions in each of the last three years are further discussed in Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Report).\nWe will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner, including focusing on enhancing our solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities, accelerating growth and driving operational excellence.  Our near-term investments in growth are likely to focus on the strategies to accelerate growth set forth in table 2 above.  Our near-term\n8\ninvestments to drive operational excellence are likely to focus on improving the customer experience and gaining efficiency, systems standardization, digital enablement of our processes and footprint optimization.\nAssets and capabilities to deliver value\nInnovation\nWe are a leading innovator in diagnostic information services.  We develop and introduce new tests, including many with a focus on personalized and targeted medicine, and new services.  Our capabilities include discovery, technology development and clinical validation of diagnostic tests.  We also partner with other developers of new technologies, services and tests to transfer their innovations to the marketplace, using our in-house expertise (\ne.g.\n, strength in assay development and commercialization of testing services).  These developers include large commercial manufacturers, the academic community, pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, emerging medical technology companies and others that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics, pharmaceutical and device technologies.  We maintain relationships with advisers and consultants who are leaders in key fields of science and medicine.  As the industry leader with the largest and broadest U.S. network, we believe we are the distribution channel of choice for developers of new solutions.\nWe seek innovations and solutions that help healthcare providers care for their patients through better testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices, and that will reduce the overall cost of healthcare.  We seek to develop innovations and solutions that help to determine a patient's genotype or gene expression profile relative to a particular disease and its potential therapies, because they can help healthcare providers to determine a patient's susceptibility to disease or to tailor medical care to an individual's needs.  This would include determining if a medication might be an optimum choice for a particular person, or tailoring the right dosage once the proper medicine is prescribed.  We endeavor to improve test processes, including through increased automation.  In addition, we aim to develop holistic solutions responsive to challenges that healthcare providers and patients face, by developing solutions of tests, information and services focused on specific clinical challenges, and taking advantage of the latest informatics capabilities.  We also look for innovations and solutions that are less invasive than currently available options, to increase the choices that healthcare providers and patients have for the collection of diagnostic samples.  We additionally seek innovation in the ways we bring solutions to customers, and in the customer experience, including enhanced services and end-to-end solutions for convenience and support.  Further, we\n9\nseek innovative solutions to other challenges related to diagnostics information services faced by IDNs, health plans and other healthcare market participants.\nIn 2020, we secured Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA for pooled specimen testing in connection with molecular diagnostic COVID-19 testing.  We also developed and launched new test offerings to educational institutions, such as colleges and universities, to help facilitate the return to classrooms.  In addition, we launched automated next generation genetic sequencing, which will enable genetic screening faster and at much lower cost.  With government and private sector partners, we developed and built  \"pop-up\" COVID-19 testing sites that offered a new, efficient model for consumer access to testing.  These initiatives, along with other 2020 developments highlighted below under the headings \"Collaboration,\" Medical and Scientific Expertise,\" and \"Healthcare Information Technology Solutions and Information Assets,\" demonstrated our strength in innovation during 2020.\nCollaboration\nWe believe that strategic relationships, including with healthcare providers, public health authorities, consumer-focused entities and others, can position us for growth at the center of healthcare and that healthcare companies that can partner effectively with others will be successful in the long term.  We collaborate with partners that can help us to achieve our vision of empowering better health through diagnostic insights and have relationships across the spectrum of healthcare, including with world class healthcare and consumer-focused leaders, to foster important advances in healthcare, including in precision medicine and healthcare delivery.  We plan to continue to pursue strategic relationships to help accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.  Our collaborations with CVS Health, Walmart and other partners regarding expanding access to COVID-19 testing during 2020 demonstrate this strength.\nMedical and Scientific Expertise\nWe have strong medical and scientific expertise and aspire to be a trusted authority in diagnostic medicine, provide insights and tools to support public and personal health, lead and facilitate scientific discussion and inspire innovation.  Our medical and scientific experts regularly provide presentations, symposia and webinars regarding diagnostic testing and participate on scientific committees determining guidelines for diagnostic usage.  They also publish research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing, including in connection with our research and development efforts, in peer-reviewed journals, textbooks and other publications.  For over 30 years, the Company has published the Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index,\nTM\na series of reports on national workplace drug positivity trends based on the Company's employer workplace drug testing data, that is widely cited by employers, the federal government and the media to help identify and quantify drug abuse among the nation's workforce.  The Company also publishes Quest Diagnostics Health Trends,\nTM\na series of scientific reports that provide insights into health topics, based on analysis of objective clinical laboratory data, to empower better patient care, population health management and public health policy.   Our role at the forefront of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated this strength.  We secured numerous Emergency Use Authorizations from the FDA for innovations in connection with COVID-19 testing and specimen collection, including regarding unobserved nasal specimen self-collection, combined COVID-19 and respiratory virus tests, COVID-19 testing ordered by consumers, and methods to increase testing capacity and expand the testing supply base.  We also published over ten Health Trends reports on COVID-19 during 2020, including reports addressing the \"hidden pandemic\": reduced hemoglobin A1c diabetes monitoring as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic; a 46% decrease in newly identified cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic; and drug testing decreased by as much as 70%, while drug positivity rates increased (\ne.g\n., 35% increase for non-prescribed fentanyl; 44% increase for heroin), during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHealth Information Technology Solutions and Information Assets\nWe have a history of providing leading information technology for diagnostic information services, including for patients, clinicians and healthcare organizations.   We were the first national diagnostic information services provider to offer online patient appointment scheduling and a patient connectivity solution.  Our MyQuest\n®\npatient healthcare portal, with over 14.5 million registered users at year-end 2020, enables patients to manage healthcare and medical information for themselves and a circle of others and, among other things, use their smartphone or computer to order a test, find a Quest Diagnostics location, schedule appointments, receive appointment reminders, and receive and archive their test resul\nts.  During 2020, we collaborated with CLEAR to integrate CLEAR's safe and secure \"Health Pass\" technology with the Company's advanced COVID-19 testing capabilities to foster safer public environments and help reduce public health risk.  We also are a founding member of the Synaptic Healthcare Alliance, which is working to create a platform, powered by blockchain technology, that enables a culture of innovation, removes friction and solves shared challenges impacting constituents across healthcare today.\n10\nWe also have significant information assets and offer a robust portfolio of powerful analytics that inspire action and deliver value to an array of customers.  We offer an array of Quanum\n®\nsolutions based on data insights, including retrospective analytics solutions for healthcare professionals and practices, health plans, IDNs, pharmaceutical companies and public health.  We believe that solutions can tap the potential of large amounts of clinical information to: enhance the customer experience; deliver more precise, comprehensive solutions and actionable information; provide increased and interactive insights and analytics; foster greater adherence to clinical and reimbursement guidelines; and advance the development of precision medicine.  We believe that the breadth and depth of our data, combined with our powerful analytics capabilities, enables us to take advantage of important data-based opportunities in diagnostics, and provides us a competitive advantage.\nCustomer Focus\nOur brand -- Action from Insight\n®\n-- reflects our commitment to a superior customer experience.  The customer is at the center of everything we do; we strive to give them reason to put their trust in us.  We use customer insights in developing our approach, listening to the voice of customers to identify and implement solutions and processes that will result in a superior customer experience.  We also maintain our Everyday Excellence program, which includes guiding principles to support a superior customer experience, inspiring our employees to be their best every day, with every person and with every customer interaction.\nBUSINESS OPERATIONS\nThe Company is made up of two businesses:  Diagnostic Information Services and Diagnostic Solutions.  Our Diagnostic Information Services business develops and delivers diagnostic information services, providing insights that empower and enable a broad range of customers, including patients, clinicians, hospitals, IDNs, health plans, employers, ACOs and DCEs.  Our Diagnostic Solutions group includes our risk assessment services business, which offers solutions for insurers, and our healthcare information technology businesses, which offers solutions for healthcare providers.  Our services primarily are provided under the Quest Diagnostics brand, but we also provide services under other brands, including AmeriPath,\n®\nDermpath Diagnostics,\n®\nExamOne,\n®\nand Quanum.\n®\nWe are the leading provider in the United States, where we conduct substantially all of our business, of clinical laboratory and anatomic pathology testing, and related services.  We see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic information services to markets outside the United States, including leveraging existing facilities to serve new markets.

During 2020, COVID-19 was a key focus area for the Global Diagnostics Network, as members shared experiences and best practices regarding COVID-19 testing.\n11\nDiagnostic Information Services\nBackground - clinical testing.\nClinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.  Clinicians use clinical testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions.  Clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services.   Anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients.\nClinical laboratory testing, which can be characterized as routine, non-routine or advanced, generally is performed on whole blood, serum, plasma and other body fluids, such as urine, and specimens such as microbiology samples.  Clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine.  Routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney, heart, liver, thyroid and other organs.  Commonly ordered routine tests include blood chemistries, urinalysis, allergy tests and complete blood cell counts.  Non-routine tests may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated informatics, technology, equipment or materials, may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests.  It may not be practical, from a cost-effectiveness or infrastructure perspective, for many hospitals, IDNs, ACOs, DCEs, commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of non-routine tests, or to perform low-volume non-routine testing in-house.  Such tests generally are outsourced to a clinical testing laboratory which can perform these non-routine tests.  Some non-routine tests are advanced.  Advanced tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics (including next-generation sequencing), oncology, neurology, companion diagnostics and non-invasive pre-natal and other germline genetic testing.\nOur services.\nWe are the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services.  We provide information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  We have strong testing capabilities, including services for the predisposition, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers and other diseases, and offer advanced tests in many fields, including endocrinology, immunology, neurology and oncology.  Increasingly, we are focused on providing solutions and insights to our customers, based on the testing that we perform, the data that we gather and our extensive medical, information and connectivity assets.  We believe that offering services, solutions and insights based on a full range of tests, information assets and other capabilities strengthens our market offering, market position and reputation.\nWe offer the broadest access in the United States to clinical testing.  We maintain a nationwide network of laboratories, including advanced laboratories (such as our world-renowned Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute\n®\n) as well as rapid response laboratories (smaller facilities where we can quickly perform an abbreviated menu of routine tests for customers that require rapid turnaround times).  We operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Our nationwide network also includes patient service centers, phlebotomists in physician offices, and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile paramedics, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.

We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry, including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which include the increased adoption of telemedicine, will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.  There are a number of key trends that are having, and that we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business.  These trends, discussed in the table below, present both opportunities and risks.  We believe that several of the trends, including consolidation, price transparency and consumerization, are favorable to our business.\n14\nBecause diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term.  In addition, we believe that the clinical testing market continued with fundamental changes in 2020.  First, we believe that PAMA-driven reimbursement pressure is negatively impacting access to care and hurting the clinical testing industry, and remains a catalyst for structural change in the market.  Second, we believe that health plans increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services.  Third, we believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare, with increased cost being borne by consumers, is sharpening focus on price disparities.  We believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit low-cost, high-value providers like Quest and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the long-term growth expected in the industry.\n15\n16\n17\n18\nThe Value of Diagnostic Information Services\nAs noted in table 11, there is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare.  There also is increased focus on a disease-oriented approach to diagnostics, treatment and management. Healthcare providers, consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention and treatment.  Healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease, to detect the symptoms of disease earlier, to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen, to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results.  Table 12 highlights how diagnostic information services contribute to improving care and reducing healthcare costs.\nCustomers\nWe provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers, including those discussed below.  As discussed in table 11 above, customers are consolidating, converging and diversifying.  In many cases, the customer that orders our services is not responsible for paying for these services. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, the payer may be the patient or a third party, such as a health plan, Medicare or a Medicaid program.  Increasingly, patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them, even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment.  In addition, patients are more frequently taking advantage of offerings like the Company's QuestDirect offering, and requesting and paying for tests themselves.\n19\n20\n21\nCompetition.\nWhile there has been consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years, our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive.  We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories.  Our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc.  In addition, we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized advanced laboratories.  In anatomic pathology, we compete with anatomic pathology practices, including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices, and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions.  There also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities and/or bring pathologists into their practices, thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices.\nWe believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a positive customer experience, a staff including medical and scientific experts, strong quality, unparalleled access and distribution, and data-powered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage.\n22\nWe believe that large diagnostic information services providers have a competitive advantage due to their large networks and lower cost structures, including as a result of PAMA.  These advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers.  In addition, we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue.  However, a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals, which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more, or more convenient, locations in a market.  As a result, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability, quality and pricing.  In addition, market activity may increase the competitive environment.  For example, hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to hospital-affiliated laboratories, enhancing the competitive position of hospital-affiliated laboratories.  ACOs, DCEs and IDNs, and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers, in addition to the impact of informatics, also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology, new product introductions and new service offerings. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Digital pathology, still in an emerging state, is an example of this.  Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings.  Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nThe risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive.  We have many competitors, some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources.  We compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a wider array of quality, integrated services than our competitors, faster services completion and a superior applicant experience.  We compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers, including smaller and medium sized physician practices.\nGENERAL\nHuman Capital Management.\nCreating an inspiring workplace is one of our three corporate goals, and this goal drives our approach to human capital management.  Effectively managing our human capital resources is a priority with key components that include culture, safety and well-being programs, employee engagement, and development and succession planning.  Our Board of Directors actively engages in oversight of our human capital management, including by receiving management reports on key areas, strategies and initiatives.  Additional information about our human capital management strategies and initiatives is available in our annual corporate responsibility report.\nAs of January 4, 2021, we have approximately 49,000 employees, of whom approximately 40,000 are full-time and the remainder are part-time or on-call.   Our employee population is more diverse than the U.S. workforce, taken as a whole.  Approximately 72% of our employees globally are women; approximately 51% of our U.S. employees are people of color.  A majority of our employees work directly with our customers or in our laboratories.  We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.\nCulture\n.  We strive to foster a strong culture, built on our Code of Ethics, which reinforces our commitment to integrity and aligns with our vision, values, goals and brand.  We are focused on building and maintaining a culture in which all employees are empowered to raise and discuss difficult issues and valued for their strengths, experience and unique perspectives.   We encourage our employees to actively participate in their communities, and support their participation, including offering incentives for participation.  Our Everyday Excellence program includes guiding principles for our entire organization to support a superior customer experience and inspire employees to be their best every day, with every person and with every customer interaction; the program is integrated into performance assessments and frontline employee behavioral standards.\nSafety and Well-Being\n.  The health and safety of our employees is of paramount concern.  We use a systematic, risk-based approach to develop tailored incident prevention and response programs designed to keep our employees safe in each of our diverse functional areas, and use data insights and a detailed audit program to foster the effectiveness of our programs. We have a comprehensive curriculum of annual safety training, as well as training for new employees.  In 2020, our cross-functional Safely Working Together Steering Committee designed and implemented tactics, techniques and procedures to enable our colleagues to continue to work safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.  As part of our comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits program, we also offer innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employees and their families through our HealthyQuest program.  The cornerstone of our HealthyQuest program is our Blueprint for\n23\nWellness program, which empowers our employees and their dependents with health insights based on lab and biometric data and invites them each year to take the initiative to improve their physical and mental health.  We also offer other programs designed to engage employees in managing their health, including access to medical expertise and support programs tailored to their individual needs, helping them to adopt healthier behaviors and access better care at lower costs.  These include customized programs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes management, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, zero-cost lab testing and specialty drugs, advocacy for mental health concerns and special support for orthopedic surgery and for cancer and other serious diagnoses.   In 2020, The Health Project named Quest Diagnostics the sole winner of the prestigious C. Everett Koop National Health Award, which is given to health programs that deliver significant health improvements and business results.\nInclusion and Diversity\n.  We understand the need to create an environment where employees can bring their whole selves to work.  We aim to harness the unique mix of capabilities, talents, cultures, beliefs and experience of our employees and create a workforce that is demographically diverse at all levels of the organization.  In 2020, in light of societal issues raised around us, our leadership and employees engaged squarely on the issue of racial equality in our country and the workplace. Several hundred leaders participated in a session on the topic, received a toolkit to help simulate thinking and action and how to address these issues and held dozens of meetings and panels with their teams to talk about racial inequities.  We also launched, with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, Quest for Health Equity, a multi-year, $100 million-plus initiative to help reduce health disparities in underserved communities.\nEngagement\n.  Since 1997, we have sought to foster the engagement and enablement of our employees, and have regularly surveyed our employees to gauge their engagement.  Employee engagement has been a metric in the annual incentive plan for our executive officers since 2013.  During 2020, we increased our engagement efforts, including by shifting to an approach of surveying employees more frequently and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding near-weekly meetings among hundreds of company leaders to foster increased communication across the company regarding topics of concern to employees.\nDevelopment and Succession Planning\n.  We provide training on a wide array of topics to our employees.  We also offer a number of development opportunities for our employees, such as training, mentoring and education programs, including a higher education tuition reimbursement program.  In addition, we offer leadership training programs for employees at different levels, including programs designed to strengthen our more senior employee leaders to create a high-performance culture and sharpen the capabilities needed to lead our organization.  We regularly engage in succession planning for our talent, including at the most senior levels.\nSales and Marketing.\nOur Diagnostic Information Services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale of most of our services.  It coordinates closely with our clinical franchises (discussed above under the heading\nOur Strategy\n) and marketing organization.  The commercial organization is centrally led, and is organized regionally, in conjunction with our operations organization, to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers.  Our commercial organization employs world-class processes and tools and strong management discipline.  We provide industry-leading training and development, focus on opportunities with IDNs and specialty physicians, and foster a customer-focused, performance-driven culture.   We also maintain distinct sales and marketing organizations for our offerings in Diagnostic Solutions and our employer drugs-of-abuse testing services.\nInformation Technology.\nWe use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test ordering and reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data.  We endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our Company and customers.  The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems.  We take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems.\nSome of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and, as a result, we continue to use multiple information systems.  We have made significant progress implementing common systems in our regional laboratories, and we continue to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations.  We expect that our standardization efforts will take several more years to complete, and will result in significantly more centralized systems, improved operating efficiency, more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment.  Even after we complete our efforts to standardize our historic systems, we will need to focus on standardizing systems in connection with future business acquisitions.\nQuality Assurance.\nAs discussed further under the heading\nQuality\non page 7, our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality, and to meet that goal we have adopted the Quest Diagnostics Quality Program System.  Employing root cause analysis, process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring, we continuously seek to\n24\nenhance quality, reduce defects, further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes, eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our Company.\nIn our laboratory operations, our quality assurance efforts focus on pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic processes, including positive patient identification of specimens, appropriate specimen transport, analysis and report accuracy, proficiency testing, reference range relevance, process audits, statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers.  As part of our quality assurance program, we utilize internal and external proficiency testing, comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits.  We monitor test results to identify trends, biases or imprecision in our analytical processes.  We also focus on the licensing, credentialing, training and competence of our professional and technical staff.\nIn addition, we have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations, such as CMS, CAP and certain states.  All of our laboratories participate in external quality surveillance programs, including proficiency testing programs administered by CAP and several state agencies. CAP is an independent, nongovernmental organization of board-certified pathologists approved by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by CLIA.  CAP offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe. All of our major laboratories, including our laboratories outside the U.S., and a number of our rapid response laboratories, are accredited by CAP.  Accreditation includes on-site inspections and participation in the CAP (or equivalent) proficiency testing program.  Also, our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peer-review evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs.  In addition, some of our laboratories also have International Organization for Standardization certification for their quality management systems.\nFor additional information about our commitment to quality, see \"Our Strengths - Quality \" on page 7.\nIntellectual Property Rights.\nWe own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries.  From time to time, we also license patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others; we also may license our intellectual property to others. In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business.  We believe, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole.  Our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets, to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise.  We actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products, processes and other intellectual property where possible.\nEnterprise Risk Management Program\n.  We maintain an enterprise risk management program designed to promote a culture of risk awareness throughout the Company's key business, operations and support functions.  Our program, which is integrated with the Company’s governance, performance management and internal control frameworks, entails a formal continuous process that identifies, assesses, mitigates and manages the risks from both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the Company and influence its business strategy and performance.  The program is based on the most recent framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which focuses on the following risk types:\n•\nOperational risk - risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the Company’s operational objectives or fundamental reason for its existence, including: product life-cycle and execution; service quality and performance; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human capital and reputation.\n•\nFinancial risk - risks arising from the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations pursuant to its strategic and operational objectives, including exposure to broad market and more specific industry risk that could impact liquidity, interest rate, credit, pricing and reimbursement, and also to internal and external financial reporting.\n•\nLegal and compliance risk - risks arising from the regulatory and enforcement environment, legal proceedings and adherence to ethics and compliance policies and procedures.\n•\nStrategic risk - risks that will impede the Company’s plan to achieve its mission and vision and apply its core values, including changes in the broad market and Company's industry, business development and restructuring activities, competitive threats and practices, technology and product innovation, and public policy.\nAs part of our program, we routinely assess our enterprise level risks, emerging risks, overall Company-level risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management, and monitor the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation; our\n25\nBoard of Directors actively oversees our program.  Our primary risk factors are discussed in\nRisk Factors\nbeginning on page\n.\nBilling; Government Reimbursement.\nWe generally bill for diagnostic information services on a fee-for-service basis under one of two types of fee schedules; fees may be negotiated or discounted.  The types of fee schedules are:\n•\n“Client” fees charged to physicians, hospitals and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis.\n•\n“Patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain third-party payers on a claim-by-claim basis.\nBilling for diagnostic information services is very complicated.  Patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals, IDNs, ACOs, DCEs and employer groups all have different billing requirements. Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (\ne.g\n., disparity in coverage and information requirements among payers; incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians; and lack of access to patients before testing).  We maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices, and we audit our practices for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures.\nWith regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, we generally must bill Medicare directly and must accept the Medicare carrier's fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full.  In addition, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more (and in most instances, pay significantly less) than Medicare.  Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, but generally does require a patient deductible and co-insurance for anatomic pathology services.\nPart B of the Medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules.  Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under that program have been subject to change, including each year.  Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced in 2018, 2019 and 2020.  PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; reimbursement reduction from 2022-24 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  The LAB Act provided an opportunity for reforms to PAMA by delaying PAMA's next data collection and reporting period until January 1, 2021 and by ordering a study to determine ways to improve future collection of more representative market rate data under PAMA. The CARES Act, adopted in early 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the PAMA price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021 and delayed PAMA's next data collection and reporting period until January 1, 2022.\nOur net revenues reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid in 2020 were lower as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues than in recent years as a result of revenues attributable to COVID-19 testing.  Excluding revenues attributable to COVID-19 testing, our net revenues reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid in 2020 were comparable, as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues, to recent years.\n26\nREGULATION\n27\n28\nCompliance.\nWe strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  We license and maintain appropriate accreditations for all of our laboratories and, where applicable, patient service centers, as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies.  We have a long-standing and well-established compliance program.  The Quality, Safety and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees, and receives periodic management reports regarding, our compliance program.  Our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws and regulations (including regarding billing and reimbursement, and privacy of protected health information and personally identifiable information) and Company policies.  Further, we conduct in-depth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations.  We conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures.\nAs an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements.  Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments resulting from non-compliance are refunded by us.  As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, refunded the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) maintains an internet site, www.sec.gov, that contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy and information statements and other information that issuers file electronically with the SEC.

    "text": "You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of our securities.  The risks below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we presently deem immaterial, may also negatively impact us.  Our business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe U.S. healthcare system is evolving and medical laboratory testing market fundamentals are changing, and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\nThe U.S. healthcare system is evolving, in part in response to the ACA. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The ACA provided for extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage. The ACA also permits the establishment of ACOs.\nCertain aspects of the ACA have been repealed, delayed or modified.  The scope and timing of any further legislation to repeal, amend, replace, or reform the rest of the ACA is uncertain, but if such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare system.  In addition, uncertainty regarding the status of the ACA prior to any such repeal, amendment, replacement or reform could create uncertainty generally in the healthcare market.\nSeveral federal courts have issued determinations that portions of the ACA are unconstitutional; those rulings are net yet final.\n32\nSignificant change is taking place in the healthcare system, including as discussed above under the heading The Clinical Testing Industry, beginning on page 14.  For example, value-based reimbursement is increasing (\ne.g.\n, UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network); CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved.  Patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased responsibility for payment for, their healthcare.  Healthcare industry participants are evolving and consolidating.  Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (\ne.g\n., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (\ne.g\n., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (\ne.g\n., telemedicine, digital pathology).  Utilization of the healthcare system is being influenced by several factors and may result in a decline in the demand for diagnostic information services.\nIn addition, we believe that clinical testing market fundamentals are changing.  We believe that PAMA-driven reimbursement pressure is negatively impacting access to care and hurting the clinical testing industry, and remains a catalyst for structural change in the market.  We also believe that health plans increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services.  We also believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare, with increased cost being borne by consumers, is sharpening focus on price disparities.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.\nThe clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if we fail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nThe clinical testing business remains a fragmented and highly competitive industry.  We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories. We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices. Hospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient). In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.  Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory.  As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing. In addition, hospitals that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's laboratory. In recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals.  Increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position.  The formation of ACOs, DCEs and IDNs, and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers, in addition to the impact of informatics, also may increase competition to provide diagnostic information services.  In addition, new players have recently started to provide clinical lab testing services (\ne.g\n., employers; government agencies).\nThe diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Digital pathology, still in an emerging state, is an example of this.  Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings.  Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.\nGovernment payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services.\nWe face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for diagnostic information services.   One example of this is increased use of prior authorization requirements.  We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue.\nPursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced in 2018,  2019 and 2020.  PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; reimbursement rate reduction from 2022-24 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually.  The LAB Act provides an opportunity for reforms to PAMA by delaying PAMA's next data collection and reporting period until January 1, 2021 and by ordering a study to determine ways to improve future collection of more representative market rate data under PAMA.  The CARES Act, adopted in early 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the PAMA price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021 and delayed PAMA's next data collection and reporting period until January 1, 2022.\n33\nIn addition, CMS has adopted policies limiting or excluding coverage for clinical tests that we perform. We also provide physician services that are reimbursed by Medicare under a physician fee schedule, which is subject to adjustment on an annual basis.  Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. The ACA includes further provisions that are designed to control utilization and payment levels.\nIn addition, over the last several years, the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries, called “Medicare Advantage” programs, and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs.  There has been growth of health insurance plans offering Medicare Advantage programs, and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs.  States have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.  In addition, state budget pressures have encouraged states to consider several courses of action that may impact our business, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility, denying claims and service coverage restrictions.\nFrom time to time, the federal government has considered whether competitive bidding could be used to provide clinical testing services for Medicare beneficiaries at attractive rates while maintaining quality and access to care.  Congress periodically considers cost-saving initiatives.  These initiatives have included coinsurance for clinical testing services, co-payments for clinical testing and further laboratory fee schedule reductions.\nHealth plans and other third parties have taken steps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services.\nWe face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services. Examples include increased use of prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services. Since the passage of ACA, there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models. We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services. ACOs, DCEs and IDNs also may undertake efforts to reduce utilization of, or reimbursement for, diagnostic information services.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements. Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\nThe increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer.\nGovernment payers and third parties, including health plans, may establish reimbursement levels that do not properly recognize the value of new and innovative solutions.\nGovernment payers and third parties, including health plans, are taking steps to reduce utilization of, and reimbursement for, some new and innovative healthcare solutions, including new tests and other solutions that we may offer.\nIn response to requests from payers to have a strategy to report a single or at most a few codes to describe procedures used to perform molecular and toxicology testing, the American Medical Association CPT® Editorial Panel has established and replaced billing codes used to report those procedures.  The adoption of these revised codes has resulted in limited coverage decisions on certain occasions, new requirements for documentation to facilitate payment from certain payers and increased payment denials.  While some payers have adopted the new payment methods, others have not yet modified their systems and ask that laboratories continue to report their services using the previous reporting strategies, when those codes still exist.\nThese steps may discourage innovation and access to innovative solutions that we may offer.\nFailure to develop, or acquire licenses for, new tests, technology and services could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\n34\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our solutions or operate our business or increase our costs. In addition, they could introduce new tests, technologies or services that may result in a decrease in the demand for our services or cause us to reduce the prices of our services. Our success in continuing to introduce new solutions, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms. We may be unable to develop or introduce new solutions or services. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing, that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our tests or operate our business.  We also may be unable to continue to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and arrangements that we do conclude may not yield commercially successful clinical tests. If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result. In addition, if we are unable to develop and introduce, or license, new solutions, technology and services to expand our advanced testing capabilities, our services may become outdated when compared with our competition.\nFailure to establish, and perform to, appropriate quality standards to assure that the appropriate standard of quality is observed in the performance of our diagnostic information services could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation.\nThe provision of diagnostic information services involves certain inherent risks. The services that we provide are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our services may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes.\nNegligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events. We may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists, laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospital-based pathologists. We are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation.\nRISKS RELATED TO CHANGE IN PUBLIC POLICY\nAND THE REGULATORY AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENT\nWe are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements governing our activities, and we may face substantial fines and penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\nOur business is subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (including at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we engage in business. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, many of the laws and regulations applicable to us are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, including many of those relating to:\n•\nbilling and reimbursement of clinical testing;\n•\ncertification or licensure of clinical laboratories;\n•\nthe anti-self-referral and anti-kickback laws and regulations;\n•\nthe laws and regulations administered by the FDA;\n•\nthe corporate practice of medicine;\n•\noperational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical testing services are accurate, reliable and timely;\n•\nphysician fee splitting;\n•\nrelationships with physicians and hospitals;\n•\nsafety and health of laboratory employees; and\n•\nhandling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.\n35\nThese laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices. We may not be able to maintain, renew or secure required permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or commercialize our services. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation could be damaged and important business relationships with third parties could be adversely affected.\nWe regularly receive requests for information, and occasionally subpoenas, from governmental authorities. We also are subject from time to time to qui tam claims brought by former employees or other “whistleblowers.” The federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.  Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.  In addition, the government has substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed for our services, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, these types of investigations and related litigation can result in:\n•\ndiversion of management time and attention;\n•\nexpenditure of large amounts of cash on legal fees, costs and payment of damages;\n•\nincreases to our administrative, billing or other operating costs;\n•\nlimitations on our ability to continue some of our operations;\n•\nenforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages;\n•\ndecreases to the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed;\n•\nadverse affects to important business relationships with third parties;\n•\ndecreased demand for our services; and/or\n•\ninjury to our reputation.\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations may result in existing practices becoming more restricted, or subject our existing or proposed services to additional costs, delay, modification, withdrawal or reconsideration. Such changes also could require us to modify our business objectives.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by the FDA's approach to regulation.\nThe FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S.  A number of tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.\nAs the FDA moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing, its approach to regulation is impacting industry practices and participants, new competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms.\nLegislation introduced in Congress would enable the FDA to regulate LDTs, in vitro diagnostics, software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease. The FDA and the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services also have expressed views regarding the regulation of LDTs. Either new law or a revised approach to regulation of LDTs could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways, while creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing.  New competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms.\nPursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA issued final guidance regarding its position on the regulation of clinical decision software, which may be used in connection with LDTs. The guidance attempts to clarify whether FDA approval of certain software is required.  It has been used by the FDA, in part, to assert authority over the annotation software aspects of pharmacogenetic testing services.  In addition, the FDA continued during 2020 to work on a pre-certification program to help software developers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software.\nFailure to accurately bill for our services, or to comply with applicable laws relating to government healthcare programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business\n.\n36\nBilling for diagnostic information services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, clinicians, hospitals and employer groups.  The majority of billing and related operations for our Company are being provided by a third party under the Company's oversight.  Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs may result in various consequences, including: civil and criminal fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Certain violations of these laws may also provide the basis for a civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act, including fines and damages of up to three times the amount claimed.  The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act and similar provisions in certain state false claims acts allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers, private payers and/or patients alleging inappropriate billing practices.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion.  The federal or state government may bring claims based on our current practices, which we believe are lawful.  The federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages and fines far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  We believe that federal and state governments continue aggressive enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud.  Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel with substantial funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.\nWe are subject to numerous political, legal, operational and other risks as a result of our international operations which could impact our business in many ways.\nOur international operations increase our exposure to risks inherent in doing business in non-U.S. markets, which may vary by market and include: intellectual property legal protections and remedies; weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights; trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of services; and challenges based on differing languages and cultures.  International operations also require us to devote management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, and to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our solutions or services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights. In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following:\n•\ncease developing, performing or selling solutions or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n•\nobtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right;\n•\nredesign or re-engineer our tests;\n•\nchange our business processes; or\n•\npay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys' fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.\nAdverse results in material litigation could have an adverse financial impact and an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including, among other things, disputes as to intellectual property, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers. Some proceedings against us involve claims that are substantial in amount and could divert management's attention from operations. These proceedings also may result in substantial monetary damages.\n37\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOur outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $4.0 billion of debt outstanding.  Other than credit facilities in the normal course of business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements in place or available. Our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt. We have obtained ratings on our public debt from Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. There can be no assurance that any rating so assigned will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency's judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes in our Company or our industry, so warrant. If such ratings are lowered, our borrowing costs could increase. Changes in our credit ratings, however, do not require repayment or acceleration of any of our debt.\nWe or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us. As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with indebtedness.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nThe development of new technologies (including artificial intelligence technologies) may impact the healthcare industry, and the development of new, more cost-effective solutions that can be performed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or clinicians, could negatively impact our testing volume and revenues.\nThe diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  For example, digital pathology is an emerging technology that may change the practice of pathology.  Information technology that includes self-learning or \"artificial intelligence\" features is growing and may impact the healthcare industry.\nCompetitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by clinicians in their offices; (2) complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.  Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequent testing.  Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such test kits.\nSome traditional customers for anatomic pathology services, including specialty physicians that generate biopsies through surgical procedures, such as dermatologists, gastroenterologists, urologists and oncologists, are consolidating, have added in-office histology labs or have retained pathologists to read cases on site.  Hospitals also are internalizing clinical laboratory testing, including some non-routine and advanced testing.  Internalization of testing may reduce demand for services previously referred to outside service providers, such as the Company.\nHardware and software failures or delays in our information technology systems, including failures resulting from our systems conversions or otherwise, could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information, customers and business opportunities or otherwise adversely impact our business.\n38\nIT systems are used extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. Our success depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our IT systems.  A failure or delay in our IT systems could impede our ability to serve our customers and patients and protect their confidential data.  Despite redundancy and backup measures and precautions that we have implemented, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, system conversion or standardization initiatives, human acts and natural disasters.  These issues can also arise as a result of failures by third parties with whom we do business and over which we have limited control.  Any disruption or failure of our IT systems could have a material impact on our ability to serve our customers and patients, including negatively affecting our reputation in the marketplace.\nOur business could be negatively affected if we are unable to continue to strengthen our efficiency.\nIt is important that we continue to strengthen our efficiency to promote our competitive position and to enable us to mitigate the impact on our profitability of steps taken by government payers and health insurers to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including diagnostic information services.\nOur business operations and reputation may be materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies.\nIn our business, we collect, generate, process or maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation.  In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act; and (c) laws outside the U.S., including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.\nThe IT systems that we rely on may be subject to unauthorized tampering, cyberattack or other security breach.\nOur IT systems have been and are subject to potential cyberattacks, tampering or other security breaches.  These attacks, if successful, could result in shutdowns or significant disruptions of our IT systems and/or in unauthorized persons misappropriating intellectual property and other confidential information, including patient data that we obtain, transmit and store on and through our IT systems.\nExternal actors may develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs, including those that target our employees, designed to attack our IT systems or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities, such as electronic spamming, phishing, spear phishing or similar tactics.  As a result of the difficulty in detecting many of these attacks, intrusions and breaches, failures or losses may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered or rectified, which could further increase these costs and consequences.\nFrom time to time, our IT systems have experienced other attacks, viruses, attempted intrusions or similar problems, but each was mitigated.  None materially disrupted, interrupted, damaged or shutdown the company's IT systems, materially disrupted the Company's performance of its business or, to the Company's knowledge, resulted in material unauthorized access to data.\nIn addition, certain third parties to whom we outsource certain of our services or functions, or with whom we interface, store or process our confidential patient data or other confidential information, as well as those third parties’ providers, are also subject to the risks outlined above. A breach or attack affecting these third parties could also harm our business, results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability.\n39\nOn June 3, 2019, the Company reported that Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc./American Medical Collection Agency (“AMCA”), informed the Company and Optum360 LLC, which provides revenue management services to the Company, about a data security incident involving AMCA (the “AMCA Data Security Incident”). AMCA (which provided debt collection services for Optum360) informed the Company and Optum360 that AMCA had learned that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA’s system between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019. AMCA first informed the Company of the AMCA Data Security Incident on May 14, 2019. AMCA’s affected system included financial information (\ne.g\n., credit card numbers and bank account information), medical information and other personal information (\ne.g\n., social security numbers). Test results were not included. Neither Optum360’s nor the Company’s systems or databases were involved in the incident.  AMCA also informed us that information pertaining to other laboratories’ customers was also affected.\nAlthough the Company has robust security measures implemented, which are monitored and routinely tested both by internal resources and external parties, cyber threats against us or our third party providers continue to evolve and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched against a potential target.  There can be no assurance that the Company or its third party providers can anticipate all such evolving future attacks, viruses or intrusions, implement adequate preventative measures, nor remediate any security vulnerabilities.  Such breaches could expose our or our third party providers' IT systems to attack, which could result in major disruption of our business, and compromise our customer’s confidential information, result in litigation and potential liability for the Company, government investigation, significant damage to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Any mitigation or remediation efforts that we undertake may require expenditures of significant resources and the diversion of the attention of management.\nWe have taken, and continue to take, precautionary measures to reduce the risk of, and detect and respond to, future cyber threats, and prevent or minimize vulnerabilities in our IT systems, including the loss or theft of intellectual property, patient data or other confidential information that we obtain and store on our systems. We also have taken, and will continue to take, measures to assess the cybersecurity protections used by our third-party providers.   In addition, we collaborate with government agencies regarding potential cyber threats and have worked with firms that have cyber security expertise to evaluate and strengthen our systems.  There can be no assurances that our precautionary measures or measures used by our third-party providers will prevent, contain or successfully defend against cyber or information security threats that could have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and reputation and subject us to liability.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nOur people are a critical resource. The supply of qualified personnel may be limited and competition for qualified employees is strong.  We may lose, or fail to attract and retain, key management personnel, or qualified skilled technical or professional employees (\ne.g\n., pathologists).\nBusiness development activities are inherently risky and integrating our operations with businesses we acquire may be difficult.\nWe plan selectively to enhance our business from time to time through business development activities, such as acquisitions, licensing arrangements, investments and alliances. However, these plans are subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities. Moreover, the success of any such effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity, and to integrate it into our business. The success of our strategic alliances depends not only on our contributions and capabilities, but also on the property, resources, efforts and skills contributed by our strategic partners. Further, disputes may arise with strategic partners, due to conflicting priorities or conflicts of interests.\nAcquisitions are not all the same (\ne.g\n., asset acquisitions differ from acquisitions of equity interests); different acquisitions offer different risks.  Acquisitions may involve the integration of a separate company that has different systems, processes, policies and cultures. Integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of assets or businesses we have acquired, difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the realization of potential operating synergies, the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired businesses, challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses, and potential adverse effects on operating results. The process of combining acquisitions may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, such businesses as a result of the following difficulties, among others:\n•\nloss of key customers or employees;\n•\ndifficulty in standardizing information and other systems;\n•\ndifficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure;\n40\n•\nfailure to maintain the quality or timeliness of services that our Company has historically provided;\n•\ndiversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of our Company as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and difficulties; and\n•\nthe added costs of dealing with such disruptions.\nIf we are unable successfully to integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. Even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of the operations of other assets or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from such integration, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, public health emergencies and health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, public health emergencies and health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities. Such events may result in a decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees' ability to perform their job duties. In addition, such events may interrupt our ability to transport specimens, to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and may continue to do so.\nA pandemic caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to severely impact the economy of the United States and other countries around the world. Federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States have implemented numerous policies and initiatives to try and reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns. These policies and initiatives have resulted in, among other things, a significant reduction in physician office visits, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, customers closing or severely curtailing their operations (voluntarily or in response to government orders), increased unemployment and loss of healthcare insurance, and the adoption of work-from-home policies, all of which have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced significant volatility, including periods of material decline compared to prior year periods, in testing volume in our base business (which excludes COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing) and this volatility, including periods of material decline, could continue. Although we also have experienced heavy demand for COVID-19 molecular testing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a positive impact on our overall testing volume, the duration and level of the demand for, and reimbursement for, COVID-19 molecular testing is uncertain.  We may also experience an adverse impact on cash collections and supply chain disruptions, including shortages, delays and price increases in testing equipment and supplies, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business, consolidated results of operation, financial position and cash flows.\nWe believe the COVID-19 pandemic’s adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be primarily driven by: the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy; the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses; and the ability to effectively and comprehensively administer COVID-19 vaccines across the U.S.  These primary drivers are beyond our knowledge and control and will change over time, and as a result, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the adverse impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and the adverse impact may be material.\nOur business also may be impacted by changes in the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic at different times in the various cities and regions where we operate and offer services, and by challenges faced in implementing nationwide COVID-19 vaccinations. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated and the business and social distancing restrictions have eased, we may continue to experience similar adverse effects to our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows resulting from a recessionary economic environment that may persist. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could exacerbate other risks identified in this Report.\n41\nCAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nSome statements and disclosures in this document are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “believe,” “will,” “expect,” “project,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “plan” or “continue.” These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our plans and expectations, including actual results, to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this document. The following important factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from those projected, forecasted or estimated by us in forward-looking statements:\n(a)    Heightened competition from commercial clinical testing companies, hospitals, physicians and others.\n(b)    Increased pricing pressure from customers, including payers and patients.\n(c)    A decline in economic conditions.\n(d)    Impact of changes in payment mix, including increased patient financial responsibility and any shift from fee-for-service to discounted, capitated or bundled fee arrangements.\n(e)    Adverse actions by government or other third-party payers, including healthcare reform that focuses on reducing healthcare costs but does not recognize the value and importance to healthcare of clinical testing or innovative solutions, unilateral reduction of fee schedules payable to us, unilateral recoupment of amounts allegedly owed and competitive bidding.\n(f)    The impact upon our testing volume and collected revenue or general or administrative expenses resulting from compliance with policies and requirements imposed by Medicare, Medicaid  and other third-party payers.

We use our extensive database of clinical lab results to derive diagnostic insights that reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  Our diagnostic information services business (\"DIS\") provides information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  We provide services to a broad range of customers, including patients, clinicians, hospitals, independent delivery networks (\"IDNs\"), health plans, employers, accountable care organizations (\"ACOs\"), and direct contract entities (\"DCEs\").  We offer the broadest access in the United States to diagnostic information services through our nationwide network of laboratories, patient service centers and phlebotomists in physician offices and our connectivity resources, including call centers and mobile paramedics, nurses and other health and wellness professionals.  We are the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services.  We provide interpretive consultation with one of the largest medical and scientific staffs in the industry.  Our DIS business makes up greater than 95% of our consolidated net revenues.  During 2020, we processed approximately 187 million test requisitions through our extensive laboratory network.\nThe clinical testing that we perform is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services.  Clinicians use clinical testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions.  The United States clinical testing industry consists of two segments.  One segment, which we believe makes up approximately 36% of the total industry, includes hospital inpatient and outpatient testing.  The second segment, which we believe makes up approximately 64% of the total industry, includes testing of persons who are not hospital patients, including testing done in commercial clinical laboratories, physician-office laboratories and other locations, as well as hospital outreach (non-hospital patients) testing.  We believe that hospital-affiliated laboratories account for approximately 36% of the second segment, commercial clinical laboratories approximately 53% and physician-office laboratories and other locations account for the balance.  Our estimates of the clinical laboratories industry do not include the impact of COVID-19 testing.\nThe clinical testing industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results and cash flows.  Typically, testing volume declines during vacation and major holiday periods, reducing net revenues and operating cash flows below annual averages.  Testing volume is also subject to declines due to severe weather or other events (such as public health emergencies and health pandemics), which can deter patients from having testing performed and which can vary in duration and severity from year to year.  Additionally, orders for clinical testing generated from clinician offices, hospitals and employers can be affected by factors such as changes in the United States economy and regulatory environment, which affect the number of unemployed and uninsured, and design changes in healthcare plans, which affect utilization as well as patient responsibility for healthcare costs.\nWe assess our revenue performance for the DIS business based upon, among other factors, volume (measured by test requisitions) and revenue per requisition.\nEach requisition accompanies patient specimens, indicating the test(s) to be performed and the party to be billed for the test(s).\nRevenue per requisition is impacted by various factors, including, among other items, the impact of fee schedule changes (i.e. unit price), test mix, payer mix, and the number of tests per requisition.  Management uses number of requisitions and revenue per requisition data to assist with assessing the growth and performance of the business, including understanding trends affecting number of requisitions, pricing and test mix. Therefore, we believe that information related to changes in these metrics from period to period are useful information for investors as it allows them to assess the performance of the business.\n63\nA summary of our revenue performance over the past three years is as follows:\nThe impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our DIS revenues, including requisition volume and revenue per requisition are discussed further below under \"2020 Highlights\" and \"Impact of COVID-19\".\nDiagnostic Solutions\nIn our Diagnostic Solutions (\"DS\") businesses, which represent the balance of our consolidated net revenues, we offer a variety of solutions for life insurers and healthcare organizations and clinicians.  We are the leading provider of risk assessment services for the life insurance industry.  In addition, we offer healthcare organizations and clinicians robust information technology solutions.\n2020 Highlights\n•\nOur total net revenues of $9.4 billion were up 22.1% from the prior year.\n•\nIn DIS:\n◦\nRevenues of $9.1 billion increased by 23.4% compared to the prior year, driven by demand for COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing, and, to a lesser extent, the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in testing volume in our base business (which excludes COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing).\n◦\nVolume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased by 6.6% compared to the prior year, with organic growth (which excludes the impact of recent acquisitions) and acquisitions contributing approximately 4.5% and 2.1%, respectively.  Organic volume growth was driven by demand for COVID-19 molecular testing, partially offset by declines in testing volume in the base business. Testing volume in the base business were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and declined by 11.4% compared to the prior year.\n◦\nRevenue per requisition increased by 16.2% compared to the prior year driven, in large part, by COVID-19 molecular testing.\n•\nDS revenues of $298 million decreased by 7.0% compared to the prior year and were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n•\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Quest Diagnostics' stockholders was $1,431 million, or $10.47 per diluted share, in 2020, compared to $838 million, or $6.13 per diluted share, in 2019.\n•\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $2.0 billion in 2020, compared to $1.2 billion in 2019.\nImpact of COVID - 19\nAs a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread and severely impact the economy of the United States and other countries around the world, we are committed to being a part of the coordinated public and private sector response to this unprecedented challenge. We have made substantial investments to expand the amount of COVID-19 testing available to the country and are currently capable of performing approximately 225,000 COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests per day to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and approximately 200,000 COVID-19 antibody tests per day to aid in the detection of immune response. We have been effectively managing challenges in the global supply chain; and, at this point, we have sufficient supplies to conduct our business.\nDuring 2020, our testing volume and revenues were materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic including a decline in testing volume in our base business (which excludes COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing) which was more than offset by COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing.\n64\nDuring January and February 2020, we experienced growth in DIS revenues and volume compared to the prior year period. However, in March and April 2020, we experienced a material decline in testing volume due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During May and June 2020, we began to experience a recovery in base testing volume, which continued in the second half of 2020. Volume in our base business (which includes the impact of recent acquisitions) for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 decreased approximately 34%, 5% and 2%, respectively, compared to the prior year periods.  However, at the end of November and into December 2020, the trend of recovery in our base business volume was impacted somewhat due to the increase in COVID-19 infections across the country.\nThe decrease in base testing volume was driven by federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, a significant reduction in physician office visits, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, customers closing or severely curtailing their operations (voluntarily or in response to government orders), and the adoption of work-from-home policies, all of which have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our operating results, financial position and cash flows, including base testing volume.\nBeginning during the second quarter of 2020, we experienced growing demand for COVID-19 testing services, which partially offset the decrease in base testing volume during that period.  During the second half of 2020, as we have expanded our capacity in order to satisfy such demand, the impact of COVID-19 testing more than offset the decrease in base testing volume.  Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 molecular testing drove an increase in revenue per requisition compared to the prior year.\nIn April 2020 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") announced that it would increase the reimbursement for certain COVID-19 molecular tests making use of high-throughput technologies developed by the private sector that allow for increased testing capacity, faster results, and more effective means of combating the spread of the virus to $100 per test, effective April 14, 2020. Beginning January 1, 2021, Medicare changed the base reimbursement rate for COVID-19 diagnostic tests run on high-throughput technologies to $75 per test with an additional payment of $25 per test if the laboratory (1) completes the test in two calendar days or less and (2) completes the majority of its COVID-19 tests that use high throughput technology in two calendar days or less for all of its patients in the previous month.  Certain healthcare insurers have now moved to a similar reimbursement model for COVID-19 molecular tests.\nWe believe the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be primarily driven by: the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; healthcare insurer, government, and client payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular testing; the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We may also be impacted by changes in the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic at different times in the various cities and regions where we operate and offer services. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated and the business and social distancing restrictions have eased, we may continue to experience similar effects to our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows resulting from a recessionary economic environment that may persist. In the longer term, given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we may have more opportunities to partner with hospitals to help achieve their laboratory strategies, and the COVID-19 pandemic may also be a further catalyst for consolidation in the laboratory testing industry.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provides numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including temporary changes regarding the prior and future utilization of net operating losses, temporary changes to the prior and future limitations on interest deductions, temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes, technical corrections from prior tax legislation for tax depreciation of certain qualified improvement property, and the creation of certain payroll tax credits associated with the retention of employees. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we started taking advantage of the temporary suspension of payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes.\nThe CARES Act also includes a number of benefits that are applicable to us and other healthcare providers including, but not limited to:\n•\nproviding coverage for COVID-19 testing at no out-of-pocket cost to nearly all patients;\n•\nproviding clinical laboratories a one-year reprieve from the reporting requirements under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (\"PAMA\") as well as a one-year delay of reimbursement rate reductions for clinical laboratory services provided under Medicare that were scheduled to take place in 2021. Further revisions of the Medicare Clinical\n65\nLaboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2022 will be based on future surveys of market rates. Reimbursement reduction from 2022-2024 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually;\n•\nappropriating $100 billion to healthcare providers for related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020 and August 2020, we received approximately $65 million and $73 million, respectively, of funds that were distributed to healthcare providers for related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic under the CARES Act.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, we returned the entire $138 million of funds; and\n•\nsuspending Medicare sequestration from May 2020 to December 2020. In December 2020, the suspension of the Medicare sequestration, which has resulted in a small benefit to us in the form of higher reimbursement rates for diagnostic testing services performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, was extended through March 2021.\nSenior Notes Offerings and Retirement of Debt\nDuring January 2020, we redeemed in full the outstanding indebtedness under our senior notes due January 2020 and senior notes due March 2020 using the net proceeds from the issuance, in December 2019, of $800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% senior notes due June 2030 (the \"2030 Senior Notes\"), along with cash on hand.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss on retirement of debt in connection with the transaction, principally comprised of premiums paid, of $1 million in other income (expense), net.\nDuring May 2020, we completed a senior notes offering, consisting of $550 million aggregate principal amount of 2.80% senior notes due June 2031 (the “2031 Senior Notes”), which were issued at an original issue discount of $1 million.  During November 2020, the net proceeds from the 2031 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem in full the outstanding indebtedness under our senior notes due April 2021.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a loss on retirement of debt in connection with the transaction, principally comprised of premiums paid, of $8 million in other income (expense), net.\nFor further details regarding our debt, see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nTwo Point Strategy\nOur two point strategy is described in detail in \"\nItem 1. Business: Our Strategy\n.\"  We continued to execute our strategy during 2020 as follows:\nAcquisition of Blueprint Genetics Oy\nOn January 21, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Blueprint Genetics Oy (\"Blueprint Genetics\"), in an all cash transaction for $108 million, net of $3 million cash acquired. Blueprint Genetics is a leading specialty genetic testing company with expertise in gene variant interpretation based on next generation sequencing and proprietary bioinformatics. Through the acquisition, we acquired all of Blueprint Genetics' operations. The acquired business is included in our DIS business.\nAcquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Services Business of Memorial Hermann Health System\nOn April 6, 2020, we completed the acquisition of select assets which constitute substantially all of the operations of Memorial Hermann Diagnostic Laboratories, the outreach laboratory division of Memorial Hermann Health System (\"Memorial Hermann\") in an all cash transaction for $120 million. Memorial Hermann is a not-for-profit health system in Southeast Texas. The acquired business is included in our DIS business.\nAcquisition of the Remaining 56% Interest in Mid America Clinical Laboratories, LLC\n66\nOn August 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 56% interest in Mid America Clinical Laboratories, LLC (\"MACL\") from our joint venture partners in an all cash transaction for $93 million, net of $18 million cash acquired. MACL is the largest independent clinical laboratory provider in Indiana. Prior to the acquisition, we accounted for our 44% interest in MACL as an equity method investment, which was remeasured to its fair value of $87 million on the acquisition date, resulting in a gain of $70 million that was recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the acquisition, MACL became our wholly owned subsidiary. The acquired business is included in our DIS business.\nFor further details regarding our acquisitions, see Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nInvigorate Program\nWe are engaged in a multi-year program called Invigorate, which is designed to reduce our cost structure and improve our performance.  We currently aim annually to save approximately 3% of our costs, and in 2020 we achieved that goal.\nInvigorate has consisted of several flagship programs, with structured plans in each, to drive savings and improve performance across the customer value chain.  These flagship programs include: organization excellence; information technology excellence; procurement excellence; field and customer service excellence; lab excellence; and revenue services excellence.  In addition to these programs, we have identified key themes to change how we operate including reducing denials and patient price concessions; further digitizing our business; standardization and automation; and optimization initiatives in our lab network and patient service center network.  We believe that our efforts to standardize our information technology systems, equipment and data also foster our efforts to strengthen our foundation for growth and support the value creation initiatives of our clinical franchises by enhancing our operational flexibility, empowering and enhancing the customer experience, facilitating the delivery of actionable insights and bolstering our large data platform.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $42 million of pre-tax charges under our Invigorate program primarily consisting of systems conversion and integration costs, all of which result in cash expenditures. Additional restructuring charges may be incurred in future periods as we identify additional opportunities to achieve further cost savings.\nFor further details of the Invigorate program and associated costs, see Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOutlook and Trends\nThe healthcare system in the United States is evolving; significant change is taking place in the system.   We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry, including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased adoption of telemedicine, will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.  There are a number of key trends that are having, and that we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business.  We believe that several of the trends, including consolidation, price transparency and consumerization, are favorable to our business.\nHealthcare market participants, including governments, are focusing on controlling costs, including potentially by reducing reimbursement for healthcare services, changing reimbursement for healthcare services (including but not limited to a shift from fee-for-service to capitation), changing medical coverage policies (\ne.g\n., healthcare benefits design), denying coverage for services, requiring preauthorization of laboratory testing, requiring co-pays, introducing laboratory spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as ACOs, DCEs and patient-centered medical homes.  The ongoing trend of rising patient responsibility and increasing payer denials has resulted in an increase in our reserves for patient price concessions.  As health plans and government programs require greater levels of patient cost-sharing, our patient price concessions may continue to be negatively impacted and adversely impact our results of operations.  As previously mentioned, there could be a shift to capitation arrangements where we agree to a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member enrolled in a restricted plan, generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  In both 2020 and 2019, we derived approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenues from capitated payment arrangements.  In 2020 and 2019, we derived approximately 8% and 10%, respectively, of our testing volume from capitated payment arrangements.\nHistorically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (\"CLFS\") and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under Part B of the Medicare program have been subject to change, including each year.  Pursuant to PAMA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") promulgated revised reimbursement schedules for 2018-2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under Medicare. Under the revised Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (in 2020 CLFS revenues comprised 8% of our consolidated net revenues), reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory testing were\n67\nreduced in 2018, 2019 and 2020.   PAMA calls for further revision of the CLFS for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; reimbursement reduction from 2022-24 is capped by PAMA at 15%.  In late 2019, the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act (the “LAB Act”) was signed into law.  The LAB Act delayed PAMA's next data collection and reporting period until January 1, 2021 and ordered a study to determine ways to improve future collection of more representative market rate data under PAMA.  In 2020, the CARES Act provided clinical laboratories with a one-year reprieve from the reporting requirements under PAMA as well as a one-year delay of reimbursement rate reductions that were scheduled to take place in 2021.  Overall, we expect total reimbursement rate pressure for 2021 from all payers on a combined basis to be approximately 1%.\nIn addition, the trend of consolidating, converging and diversifying among our customers, payers and other healthcare industry participants has continued and may result in increased price transparency and bargaining power, and may encourage internalization of clinical testing.  We also believe that PAMA may be a further catalyst for consolidation as diagnostic information services providers realize lower Medicare reimbursement rates and large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures.\nFor a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see \"\nImpact of COVID-19\"\nabove.\nFor additional information on our key trends, which present both opportunities and risks, see \"\nItem 1. Business: The Clinical Testing Industry\n.\"\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect our reported financial results and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOur revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions, and about one-half of our total costs and expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits.  Due to the nature of our business, several of our accounting policies involve significant estimates and judgments:\n•\nrevenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS;\n•\nreserves for general and professional liability claims;\n•\nreserves for other legal proceedings; and\n•\naccounting for and recoverability of goodwill.\nRevenues and accounts receivable associated with DIS\nThe process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables associated with our DIS business involves significant assumptions and judgments.  We recognize as revenue the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered.  We estimate the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive from customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach.  These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions, as discussed below.  The portfolios determined using the portfolio approach consist of the following customers:\n•\nHealthcare Insurers\n•\nGovernment Payers\n•\nClient Payers\n•\nPatients\nWe have a standardized approach to estimate the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to, including the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions.  Historical collection and payer reimbursement experience (along with the period the receivables have been outstanding) is an integral part of the estimation process related to revenues and receivables.  Adjustments to our estimated contractual allowances and implicit patient price concessions are recorded in the current period as changes in estimates. Further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.\n68\nWe regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues which may impact the collectability of receivables or revenue estimates. We believe that the collectability of our receivables is directly linked to the quality of our billing processes, most notably those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services we provide. As such, we continue to implement “best practices” and endeavor to increase the use of electronic ordering to reduce the number of requisitions that we receive from healthcare providers with missing or incorrect billing information. We believe that our collection and revenue estimation processes, along with our close monitoring of our billing operations, help to reduce the risk associated with material adjustments to reserve estimates.  However, changes to our estimate of the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period that the estimates are adjusted.\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage of our total requisition volume and net revenues associated with our DIS business during 2020 applicable to each customer group:\n*Patients revenue includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities but volume associated with such revenue is reported under Healthcare insurers.\nThe following table shows net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 applicable to each customer group:\nHealthcare insurers\nReimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.  Under fee-for-service arrangements, healthcare insurers are billed at our list price.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of our contractual arrangements.\nSubstantially all of the accounts receivable due from healthcare insurers represent amounts billed under fee-for-service arrangements.  Collection of our net revenues from healthcare insurers is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing.  Provided we have billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, we will reserve accordingly for the billing.\nUnder capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers, we recognize revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer's health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  Under capitated payment arrangements, the healthcare insurers typically reimburse us in the same month services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period.  If any capitated\n69\npayments are not received on a timely basis, we determine the cause and make a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and, if so, would reserve accordingly.\nGovernment payers\nReimbursements from government payers are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare and Medicaid.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience.\nCollection of our net revenues from government payers is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines.  Collection generally occurs within 30 days of billing.  Provided we have billed government payers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, we determine if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and, if so, we will reserve for the billing accordingly.\nClient payers\nClient payers include physicians, hospitals, ACOs, DCEs, IDNs, employers, other commercial laboratories and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed based on a negotiated fee schedule.  Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers.  Collection of consideration we expect to receive generally occurs within 60 to 90 days of billing.\nWe principally estimate the allowance for credit losses for client payers based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period that the receivables have been outstanding. To the extent that any individual client payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, we establish allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\nPatients\nUninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients.  Insured patients (includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers.  Collection of billings from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay.  Net revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with our policies and implicit price concessions.  Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration we expect to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience (along with the period the receivables have been outstanding) and other factors including current market conditions.  Patient billings are generally fully reserved for when the related billing reaches 210 days outstanding.  Balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies.  Allowances are further adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.  Collection of consideration we expect to receive generally occurs within 30 to 60 days of billing.\nAlthough we believe that our estimates for contractual allowances and patient price concessions, as well as our allowance for credit losses, are appropriate, it is possible that we will experience an impact on cash collections as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For further details on revenue and receivables, see Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nReserves for general and professional liability claims\nAs a general matter, providers of diagnostic information services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and reputation.  We maintain various liability insurance coverages for claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  Our insurance coverage limits our maximum exposure on individual claims; however, we are essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  While the basis for claims reserves is actuarially determined losses based upon our historical and projected loss experience, the process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to these types of claims involves a high degree of judgment.  Although we believe that our present reserves and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, it is possible that we may incur liabilities in excess of our recorded reserves or insurance coverage.  Changes in the facts and circumstances associated with claims could have a material\n70\nimpact on our results of operations (principally costs of services), cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.  See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our reserves for general and professional liability claims.\nReserves for other legal proceedings\nOur businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations, including inspections and audits by governmental agencies, in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.  Although we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency would not reach a different conclusion.  Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, these laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices.  We have, in the past, entered into several settlement agreements with various government and private payers relating to industry-wide billing and marketing practices that had been substantially discontinued.  The federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices, which we believe are lawful.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the\nqui tam\nprovisions of federal and state false claims acts, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers alleging inappropriate billing practices.  We are aware of certain pending lawsuits including class action lawsuits, and have received subpoenas related to billing practices.  See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the various legal proceedings that we are involved in.\nThe process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to legal proceedings involves a high degree of judgment.  Management has established reserves for legal proceedings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Changes in facts and circumstances related to such proceedings could lead to significant adjustments to reserve estimates for such matters and could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition in the period that reserve estimates are adjusted or paid.\nAccounting for and recoverability of goodwill\nWe do not amortize goodwill, but evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill annually, or more frequently, in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.  We have identified the following reporting units for goodwill impairment testing in 2020:\n•\nDIS business;\n•\nRisk assessment services business, which is part of our DS businesses\nThe DIS reporting unit components have been aggregated into a single reporting unit because they have similar economic characteristics, including similarities in financial performance, nature of products or services, nature of production processes and types of customers.\nOn a quarterly basis, we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our fair value and our goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, we would perform an impairment test of goodwill and record any noted impairment loss.\nThe annual impairment test for goodwill includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative analysis may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we assess relevant events and circumstances, such as: (a) macroeconomic conditions; (b) industry and market considerations; (c) cost factors; (d) overall financial performance; (e) other relevant entity-specific events; (f) events affecting a reporting unit; and (g) a sustained decrease in share price.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we are required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, our policy is to update the fair value calculation of our reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.\nThe quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than our estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.   We calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using either (i) a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow\n71\namounts into a single discounted present value amount or (ii) a market approach.  We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation.  The discounted cash flows analysis includes several unobservable inputs related to our own assumptions.  The assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flows model are based upon the best available information in the circumstances and include a forecast of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates that are commensurate with economic risks, assumed income tax rates and estimates of capital expenditures and working capital.  The fair values of the reporting units could be different if, for example, forecasted revenue growth rates, economic conditions, government regulations or actions by payers to control utilization of or reimbursement for healthcare services, turn out to be different than our assumptions or estimates.  Changes in the assumed discount rates due to changes in interest rates could also affect the estimated fair values of the reporting units.  We use a discount rate that considers a weighted average cost of capital plus an appropriate risk premium based upon the reporting unit being valued.  Our analysis also considers publicly available information regarding our market capitalization, as well as (i) the financial projections and future prospects of our business, including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements, and (ii) comparable sales prices, if available.  We believe our estimation methods are reasonable and reflect common valuation practices.\nWe perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, in accordance with our policy to perform the quantitative test on a periodic basis, we updated the fair value calculation of  our reporting units, performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.  As a sensitivity, if the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units decreased by 10%, we would have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired.\nResults of Operations\nFor the discussions on the year-over-year changes for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 and the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur DIS business currently represents our one reportable business segment.  The DIS business for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 accounted for greater than 95% of our consolidated net revenues.  Our other operating segments consist of our DS businesses.  For further details regarding our business segment information, see Note 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain results of operations data for the periods presented:\n72\nNM - Not Meaningful\nThe following table sets forth certain results of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods presented:\n73\nOperating Results\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2020 were affected by certain items that on a net basis decreased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.71 as follows:\n•\npre-tax amortization expense of $114 million ($103 million in amortization of intangible assets and $11 million in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes) or $0.63 per diluted share;\n•\nnet pre-tax charges of $72 million ($57 million of charges in cost of services, $10 million of charges in selling, general and administrative expenses and $9 million of charges in other operating expense (income), net, partially offset by a $4 million gain in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes), or $0.39 per diluted share, representing the impact of certain items resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, principally including expense associated with payments to eligible employees to help offset expenses they incurred as a result of COVID-19, incremental costs incurred primarily to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, and certain asset impairment charges; and\n•\npre-tax charges of $58 million ($27 million in cost of services and $31 million in selling, general and administrative expenses), or $0.32 per diluted share, primarily associated with systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business; partially offset by\n•\na pre-tax gain of $70 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, recognized in other income (expense), net upon the acquisition of the remaining 56% interest in MACL as a result of the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest to fair value;\n•\nexcess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements of $23 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, recorded in income tax expense; and\n•\na net pre-tax gain of $2 million (a $14 million gain in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes, partially offset by a $10 million loss in other income (expense), net and $2 million of charges in selling, general and administrative expenses) primarily due to a gain recognized by an equity method investee to adjust certain of its investments to fair value, a loss on retirement of debt, and, to a lesser extent, costs associated with Quest for Health Equity, our recently announced initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation to reduce health disparities in underserved communities.\nResults for the year ended December 31, 2019 were affected by certain items that on a net basis reduced diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $0.43 as follows:\n•\npre-tax amortization expense of $111 million ($96 million in amortization of intangible assets and $15 million in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes) or $0.61 per diluted share; and\n•\npre-tax charges of $78 million ($35 million in cost of services and $43 million in selling, general and administrative expenses), or $0.42 per diluted share, primarily associated with systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our business; partially offset by\n•\na net pre-tax gain of $89 million (a $95 million gain in other operating expense (income), net offset by a $6 million charge in selling, general and administrative expenses), or $0.50 per diluted share, primarily due to a gain associated with the sale and leaseback of a property, a gain associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accruals associated with previous acquisitions, and a gain associated with proceeds from an insurance claim for hurricane related losses, partially offset by costs incurred related to a data security incident, and non-cash asset impairment charges; and\n•\nexcess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements of $13 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, recorded in income tax expense.\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 22.1% compared to the prior year.\n74\nDIS revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 23.4% compared to the prior year driven by demand for COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing, and, to a lesser extent, the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in testing volume in our base business (which excludes COVID-19 molecular and antibody testing).\n•\nOrganic revenue and acquisitions contributed approximately 21.6% and 1.8%, respectively, to DIS revenue growth.\n•\nDIS volume increased by 6.6%, with organic growth and acquisitions contributing approximately 4.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Organic volume growth was driven by demand for COVID-19 molecular testing, partially offset by declines in testing volume in the base business.  Testing volume in the base business was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and declined by 11.4% compared to the prior year.\n•\nRevenue per requisition increased by 16.2% compared to the prior year primarily due to favorable mix, driven in large part by COVID-19 molecular testing, partially offset by reimbursement pressure, including unit price reductions associated with PAMA and all other sources, of approximately 1.7%.\nCost of Services\nCost of services consists principally of costs for obtaining, transporting and testing specimens as well as facility costs used for the delivery of our services.\nCost of services increased by $767 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.  The increase was primarily driven by higher variable expenses related to increased testing volume as well as test mix and a higher supply cost associated with COVID-19 testing, additional operating costs associated with our acquisitions, higher performance-based compensation, and incremental costs incurred related to the COVID-19 pandemic including expense associated with payments to eligible employees to help offset expenses they incurred as a result of COVID-19 and costs incurred to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers. These increases were partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs as a result of a series of temporary actions implemented to manage our workforce costs.\nIn order to mitigate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, we implemented a series of temporary actions in April 2020 to manage our workforce costs and preserve cash including temporary salary reductions; suspension of certain benefits; reduced hours for employees whose work had significantly declined; and approved furloughs for employees with diminished work requirements who expressed an interest. As our testing volume started to recover, we recalled the vast majority of employees from furlough and reinstated full working hours for almost all employees who were asked to work reduced hours. By the end of the third quarter of 2020, salaries were restored for all exempt employees that had temporary salary reductions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (\"SG&A\")\nSG&A consists principally of the costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts, billing operations, credit loss expense and general management and administrative support as well as administrative facility costs.\nSG&A increased by $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation and additional operating costs associated with our acquisitions.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe $7 million increase in amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year was a result of recent acquisitions.\n75\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net includes miscellaneous income and expense items and other charges related to operating activities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other operating expense (income), net primarily represents impairment charges due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other operating expense (income), net included a $73 million gain associated with the sale and leaseback of a property, a $12 million gain associated with proceeds from an insurance claim for hurricane related losses and a $12 million gain associated with the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration accruals associated with previous acquisitions, partially offset by non-cash asset impairment charges of $2 million.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower interest rates associated with our variable rate indebtedness, partially offset by higher average outstanding indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net represents miscellaneous income and expense items related to non-operating activities, such as gains and losses associated with investments and other non-operating assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, other income, net included a $70 million gain recognized as a result of the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MACL to fair value (see Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements) and gains associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans, partially offset by a $9 million loss on the retirement of debt, principally due to premiums paid.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, other income, net included $19 million of gains associated with investments in our deferred compensation plans.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $460 million and $247 million, respectively.  The increase in income tax expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees.\nThe effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 24.5% and 23.0%, respectively.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 benefited from a lower effective income tax rate (11.8%) associated with a $70 million gain recognized as a result of the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in MACL to fair value due to a permanent difference in the financial reporting and tax basis of goodwill, and $23 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements.  The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 benefited from a $12 million release of valuation allowances associated with net operating loss carryforwards, and $13 million of excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements.\nEquity in Earnings of Equity Method Investees, Net of Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an $18 million increase in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes, compared to the prior year primarily due to a $14 million gain recognized by an equity method investee to adjust certain of its investments to fair value.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring the third quarter of 2006, we completed the wind down of Nichols Institute Diagnostics (\"NID\"), a test kit manufacturing subsidiary, which was classified as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes discrete income tax benefits of $20 million associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies related to NID.\n76\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe address our exposure to market risks, principally the risk of changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  We seek to mitigate the variability in cash outflows that result from changes in interest rates by maintaining a balanced mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt obligations.  In order to achieve this objective, we have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements.  Interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net.  We believe that our exposures to foreign exchange impacts and changes in commodity prices are not material to our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  For further details regarding our significant accounting policies on interest rate risk and foreign currency, see Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of our debt was estimated at approximately $\n4.6\nbillion and $\n5.1\nbillion, respectively, principally using quoted prices in active markets and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the debt by $597 million and $313 million, respectively.  A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates (representing 17 basis points as of December 31, 2020 and 28 basis points as of December 31, 2019) would potentially reduce the estimated fair value of our debt by approximately $82 million and $100 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nBorrowings under our secured receivables credit facility and our senior unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates. Interest on our secured receivables credit facility is based on either commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or LIBOR, plus a spread. As of December 31, 2020, interest on our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin based on changes in our public debt ratings and our leverage ratio. As such, our borrowing cost under this credit arrangement is subject to fluctuations in interest rates, our leverage ratio and changes in our public debt ratings.  As of December 31, 2020, the borrowing rates under these debt instruments were: for our secured receivables credit facility, commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or LIBOR, plus a spread of 0.825% to 0.95%; and for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, LIBOR plus 1.125%.  As of December 31, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under either our $600 million secured receivables credit facility or our $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nIn April 2020, we terminated our existing fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements. Based on our remaining net exposure to interest rate changes, a hypothetical 10% change to the variable rate component of our variable rate indebtedness would not materially change annual interest expense.\nDuring March 2020, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution for a total notional amount of $25 million. Additionally, during May 2020, we entered into interest rate lock agreements with several financial institutions for a total notional amount of $275 million. The forward-starting interest rate swap agreement and the interest rate lock agreements were entered into in order to hedge a portion of our interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates over a ten-year period related to an anticipated issuance of debt and were accounted for as cash flow hedges. In connection with the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes, these agreements were settled and we received net proceeds of $1 million. The net gain is deferred in stockholders' equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and is being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over a ten-year period.\nFor further details regarding our outstanding debt and our financial instruments and hedging activities, see Notes 13 and 15, respectively, to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nRisk Associated with Investment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio primarily includes equity investments comprised mostly of strategic holdings in privately and publicly held companies.  These securities are exposed to price fluctuations and are generally concentrated in the life sciences and healthcare industries.  Equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.  We regularly evaluate these equity investments to determine if there are any indicators that the investment is impaired.  The carrying value of our equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values was $25 million as of December 31, 2020.\n77\nWe do not hedge our equity price risk.  The impact of an adverse movement in equity prices on our holdings in privately held companies cannot be easily quantified, as our ability to realize returns on investments depends on, among other things, the enterprises’ ability to raise additional capital or derive cash inflows from continuing operations or through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers or private sales.\nIn conjunction with the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we considered whether the carrying values of our investments were impaired and concluded that no impairment existed.  However, should the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic be worse than currently expected, it is possible that we could incur impairment charges in the future.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly-liquid short-term investments.  Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $1,158 million and $1,192 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 4% of our $1,158 million of consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the United States.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,005 million, and increased $762 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of:\n•\nhigher operating income in 2020 as compared to 2019; and, to a lesser extent\n•\na $100 million increase due to the temporary suspension in 2020 of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes; and\n•\n$40 million of proceeds received in 2020 from the termination of interest rate swap agreements; partially offset by\n•\na $158 million increase in income tax payments;\n•\nhigher performance-based compensation payments in 2020 compared to 2019; and\n•\na $28 million refund received in the prior year period from the taxing authorities associated with the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies related to a discontinued operation.\nDays sales outstanding, a measure of billing and collection efficiency, was 46 days as of December 31, 2020 and 54 days as of December 31, 2019.  The decrease in DSO is partially due to recent fluctuations in our monthly revenue due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we believe that our current revenue reserves and allowance for credit losses are appropriate, it is possible that we will experience an impact on cash collections as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $772 million, compared to $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  This $361 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of:\n•\na $272 million increase in net cash paid for business acquisitions; and\n•\nan $88 million decrease in proceeds from disposition of property, plant and equipment, primarily due to proceeds in the prior year period associated with the sale and leaseback of a property.\n78\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,267 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $225 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  This $1,492 million change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily a result of:\n•\n$805 million of net debt repayments (repayments of debt less proceeds from borrowings) in 2020 compared to $832 million of net borrowings in 2019; partially offset by\n•\na $76 million increase in overdrafts, which are generally settled in cash the following day; and\n•\na $70 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, which was a result of an increase in the volume of stock options exercised and the average exercise price compared to the prior year.\nDuring January 2020, we redeemed in full the outstanding indebtedness under our senior notes due January 2020 and senior notes due March 2020 using net proceeds from the issuance, in December 2019, of the 2030 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand.  During May 2020, we completed the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes, the net proceeds from which were used during November 2020, along with cash on hand, to redeem in full the outstanding indebtedness under our senior notes due April 2021.  Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we borrowed $100 million under our secured receivables credit facility and $100 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, both of which were repaid prior to December 31, 2020.\nDuring March 2019, we completed the issuance of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% senior notes due June 2029 and repaid in full, at maturity, our senior notes due April 2019.  In December 2019, we completed the issuance of the 2030 Senior Notes.  In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019 we borrowed a total of $985 million under our secured receivables credit facility to fund periodic working capital requirements, as well as our 2019 acquisition, and repaid $1,145 million under our secured receivables credit facility.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings or repayments under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nFor details regarding our debt and related transactions, see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDividend Program\nDuring each of the four quarters of 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.56 per common share.  During each of the four quarters of 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per common share.  On February 4, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a 10.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.56 to $0.62 per share, or $2.48 per share annually, commencing with the dividend payable in April 2021.\nShare Repurchases\nAs\nof December 31, 2020, $0.9 billion remained available under our share repurchase authorization.  In February 2021, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional $1 billion of our common stock.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $325 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our common stock for $350 million.\nFor further details regarding our share repurchases, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n79\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nInterest payments on our outstanding debt include interest associated with finance lease obligations and have been calculated using the interest rates as of December 31, 2020 applied to the December 31, 2020 balances, which are assumed to remain outstanding through their maturity dates.  A description of the terms of our indebtedness and related debt service requirements is contained in Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statement\nOperating lease obligations include variable charges (primarily maintenance fees and utilities associated with our real estate leases) in effect as of December 31, 2020.  A discussion and analysis regarding our operating lease obligations is contained in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nPurchase obligations include our noncancellable commitments to purchase products or services as described in Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits were approximately $93 million, which were excluded from the table above.  We expect that these liabilities may decrease by less than $15 million within the next twelve months, primarily as a result of payments, settlements, expiration of statutes of limitations and/or the conclusion of tax examinations on certain tax positions.  For the remainder, we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of the future payments of these liabilities.  See Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements for information regarding our contingent tax liability reserves.\nIn connection with the sale of an 18.9% noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass Memorial Medical Center (\"UMass\"), we granted UMass the right to require us to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest on the audited consolidated balance sheet was $82 million, which was excluded from the table above.  Since the redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the future payment, if any, of the redeemable noncontrolling interest.  For further details regarding the redeemable noncontrolling interest, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Method Investees\nOur equity method investees primarily consist of our clinical trials central laboratory services joint venture, our diagnostic information services joint venture, and an investment in a fund that purchases strategic holdings in private companies in the healthcare industry. Such investees are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Our investment in equity method investees is less than 5% of our consolidated total assets.  Our proportionate share of income before income taxes associated with our equity method investees is less than 5% of our consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of equity method investees.  We partially guarantee a lease obligation of one of our equity method investees; payment under such guarantee is not likely at this time and we have no other material unconditional obligations or guarantees to, or in support of, our equity method investees and their operations.\nIn conjunction with the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we considered whether the carrying values of our equity method investments were impaired and concluded that no such impairment existed.  However, should the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic be worse than currently expected, it is possible that we could incur impairment charges in the future.\n80\nFor further details regarding related party transactions with our equity method investees, see Note 20 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nRequirements and Capital Resources\nWe estimate that we will invest approximately $350 million to $400 million during 2021 for capital expenditures, to support and grow our existing operations, principally related to investments in information technology; laboratory equipment and facilities, including COVID testing equipment and completion of our new multi-year laboratory construction in New Jersey; and investments in our advanced diagnostics and consumer growth strategies.\nTogether with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, we launched a multi-year initiative to reduce health disparities in underserved communities, including those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of this initiative, we plan to offer testing services and fund a range of initiatives estimated to total more than $100 million aimed at improving access to testing and awareness of the value of diagnostic insights in managing overall health, a significant portion of which will occur in 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $1.3 billion of borrowing capacity was available under our existing credit facilities consisting of $530 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.  There were no borrowings under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2020.  In support of our risk management program, to ensure our performance or payment to third parties, $70 million in letters of credit under the secured receivables credit facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2020.  The secured receivables credit facility includes a $250 million loan commitment which matures October 2021, and a $250 million loan commitment and a $100 million letter of credit facility which mature October 2022.  The senior unsecured revolving credit facility matures in March 2023.  For further details regarding the credit facilities, see Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOur secured receivables credit facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, and certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants and limitations on indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such applicable financial covenants.\nIn 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took certain actions to preserve liquidity including temporarily suspending share repurchases under our existing share repurchase authorization (which suspension was lifted in November 2020) and implementing a series of temporary actions to manage our workforce costs.\nIn addition, we took certain steps to ensure adequate access to liquidity. In April 2020, we entered into an amendment to our senior unsecured revolving credit facility in order to provide for increased flexibility. Pursuant to the amendment, the leverage ratio covenant was increased as follows:\nThereafter, the leverage ratio covenant reverts to no more than 3.5 times EBITDA.  During the period that the increased covenant applies, which period may be terminated early by us provided that we are in compliance with the historical 3.5 times EBITDA leverage ratio, the amended credit agreement contains certain additional limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, repurchases of our common stock, the amount of funds that can be used on business acquisitions, the incurrence of secured indebtedness and the payment of dividends.\nIn addition, in May 2020, we completed the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes.  In November 2020, we redeemed in full the outstanding indebtedness under our senior notes due April 2021 using the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will provide sufficient financial flexibility to fund seasonal and other working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other obligations, cash dividends on common shares, share repurchases and additional growth opportunities for the foreseeable future.  However, should it become necessary, we believe that our credit\n81\nprofile should provide us with access to additional financing in order to fund normal business operations, make interest payments, fund growth opportunities and satisfy upcoming debt maturities.\nInflation\nWe believe that inflation generally does not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nImpact of New Accounting Standards\nThe adoption of new accounting standards is discussed in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nThe impacts of recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective on our audited consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\n82\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of the Company, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in\n“Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)”\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 is effective.\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report, audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 and issued their audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting included herein.\n83\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated\nand its subsidiaries\n(the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2020\nand 2019,\nand the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and financial statement schedule\nof valuation accounts and reserves for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\nWe also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated\nfinancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019\n,\nand the results of its\noperations and its\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\nF-1\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Diagnostic Information Services (DIS) Business Accounts Receivable - Contractual Allowances\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management estimates the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to receive from customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials) and patient price concessions. The portfolio approach includes the following groups of customers: healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients (34%, 6%, 46% and 11% of consolidated net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020, respectively, as disclosed by management). The DIS business accounted for 97% of consolidated net accounts receivable ($1,520 million) as of December 31, 2020. Net revenues and accounts receivable recognized from healthcare insurers and government payers consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and, additionally for healthcare insurers, the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements. As disclosed by management, the process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of receivables associated with the DIS business involves significant assumptions and judgments.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of DIS business accounts receivable - contractual allowances is a critical audit matter are the estimate of net collectible accounts receivable, specifically contractual allowances, involves significant judgment and estimation on the part of management; this in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate the audit evidence related to the contractual allowances.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of DIS business accounts receivable, which included controls over management’s methodology and data used to estimate contractual allowances. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the estimate for contractual allowances, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical contractual allowance and collection data from the Company’s billing system, which is an input to the methodology, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions used to estimate contractual allowances by comparing actual cash collected to the prior year estimate (net accounts receivable).\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1995.\nF-2\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDECEMBER 31, 2020 AND 2019\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-3\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-4\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-5\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-6\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020, 2019 AND 2018\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\nF-7\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n1.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nBackground\nQuest Diagnostics Incorporated and its subsidiaries (\"Quest Diagnostics\" or the \"Company\") empower people to take action to improve health outcomes.  The Company uses its extensive database of clinical lab results to derive diagnostic insights that reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management.  The Company's diagnostic information services business (\"DIS\") provides information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.

Additionally, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which the Company has a variable interest and for which the Company is the “primary beneficiary” as it has both: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nIncome attributable to the minority interest in the Company's majority owned and controlled consolidated subsidiaries is recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations and the noncontrolling interest is reflected as a separate component of consolidated stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\nBasis of Presentation\nDuring the third quarter of 2006, the Company completed the wind down of Nichols Institute Diagnostics (\"NID\"), a test kit manufacturing subsidiary.  The accompanying consolidated statements of operations and related disclosures report the results of NID as discontinued operations through 2019, at which point certain income tax contingencies related to NID were resolved.  See Note 21 for a further discussion of discontinued operations.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current period financial statements.\nF-8\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in entities which the Company does not control, but in which it has a substantial ownership interest (generally between\n20\n% and\n49\n%) and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  These investments are classified as investments in equity method investees in the consolidated balance sheet.  The Company records its pro rata share of the earnings, adjusted for accretion of basis difference, of these investments in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company reviews its investments in equity method investees for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes as revenue the amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for goods sold or services rendered primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered (see Note 3).  Net revenues from Medicare and Medicaid programs were approximately\n11\n%,\n15\n% and\n16\n% of the Company's consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTaxes on Income\nThe provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.  Current and deferred income taxes are measured based on the tax laws that are enacted as of the balance sheet date of the relevant reporting period.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.  Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized only if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company's unvested restricted stock units that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and, therefore, are included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two-class method.  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, adjusted for earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.  Potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and performance share units granted under the Company's Amended and Restated Employee Long-Term Incentive Plan (“ELTIP”) and its Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Long-Term Incentive Plan (“DLTIP”).  Earnings allocable to participating securities include the portion of dividends declared as well as the portion of undistributed earnings during the period allocable to participating securities.\nF-9\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures stock-based compensation for equity awards at fair value on the date of grant and records stock-based compensation as a charge to earnings net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards.  As such, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost\nonly for those stock-based awards that are estimated to ultimately vest over their requisite service period, based on the vesting provisions of the individual grants.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated forfeiture rate is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  The terms of the Company's performance share units allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals, which are based on the financial performance of the Company and the total shareholder return of the Company relative to an index of peer companies (\"relative TSR\"), specified in the awards.  For performance share units with a goal based on the financial performance of the Company, stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on management's best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned.  The cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share units expected to be earned for these awards is recognized as compensation cost in earnings in the period of the change.  For performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal, stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated fair value of the award regardless of the actual number of shares earned.  For further details regarding stock-based compensation, see Note 17.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company determines fair value measurements used in its consolidated financial statements based upon the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants exclusive of any transaction costs, as determined by either the principal market or the most advantageous market.\nInputs used in the valuation techniques to derive fair values are classified based on a three-level hierarchy.  The basis for fair value measurements for each level within the hierarchy is described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.\nLevel 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.  The functional currency of the Company's foreign operating subsidiaries generally is the applicable local currency.  Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of the end of the reporting period.  Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year.  Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, are included within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have historically not been material.  The Company may be exposed to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates primarily under certain intercompany receivables and payables.  From time to time, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of the eventual net cash inflows or outflows resulting from these intercompany transactions.  The Company's foreign exchange exposure is not material to the Company's consolidated financial condition.  The Company does not hedge its net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries because it views those investments as long-term in nature.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all highly-liquid investments with original maturities, at the time acquired by the Company, of three months or less.\nF-10\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments.  The Company's policy is to place its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in highly-rated financial instruments and institutions.  Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by the diversity of the Company's payers and their dispersion across many different geographic regions, and is limited to certain payers who are large buyers of the Company's services.  To reduce risk, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of these payers and, consequently, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure, with respect to these payers, is limited.  While the Company has receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, the Company does not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related healthcare programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent on submitting appropriate documentation timely.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, receivables due from government payers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately\n6\n% and\n11\n%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The portion of the Company's accounts receivable due from patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, receivables due from patients represented approximately\n11\n% and\n20\n%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net accounts receivable.  The Company applies assumptions and judgments including historical collection experience (including the period the receivables have been outstanding) for assessing collectability and determining net revenues and accounts receivable from patients.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are reported net of allowances for credit losses.\nWhen estimating its allowance for credit losses, the Company pools its trade receivables based on the following customer types: healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients, which are described in Note 3.  The Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses by pool based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period that the receivables have been outstanding.  To the extent that any individual payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, the Company removes the customers from their respective pools and establishes allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\nInventories\nInventories, which consist principally of finished goods testing supplies and reagents, are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out method) or net realizable value.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost.  Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities and expensed as incurred for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities.  Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software, payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with the internal-use software project, and interest costs incurred, when material, while developing internal-use software.  Capitalization of such costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.  Costs for maintenance and training are expensed as incurred.  The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of major capital projects.  Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the expected useful lives of the assets.  Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over expected useful asset lives as of December 31, 2020 as follows:\n•\nbuildings and improvements, ranging up to thirty-one and a half years;\n•\nlaboratory equipment and furniture and fixtures, ranging from\nfive\nto\ntwelve years\n;\n•\nleasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful life of the improvement or the remaining life of the building or lease, as applicable; and\n•\ncomputer software developed or obtained for internal use,\nfive\nto\nten years\n.\nF-11\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the acquiree (including the fair value of non-controlling interests) over the recognized bases of the net identifiable assets acquired and includes the future economic benefits from other assets that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.  Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically reviewed for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company performs a review of its business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the Company and its goodwill.  If such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred, the Company would perform an impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the quarter and record any noted impairment loss.\nThe goodwill test is performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.  The annual impairment test includes an option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value; the qualitative test may be performed prior to, or as an alternative to, performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company is required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  Otherwise, no further analysis is required.  Additionally, the Company's policy is to update the fair value calculation of its reporting units and perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on a periodic basis.\nThe quantitative impairment test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.  The Company calculates the fair value of each reporting unit using either (i) a discounted cash flows analysis that converts future cash flow amounts into a single discounted present value amount or (ii) a market approach.  The Company assesses the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time that the valuation is performed.  The Company compares the estimate of fair value for the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit.  If the carrying value is greater than the estimate of fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, in accordance with its policy to perform the quantitative test on a periodic basis, the Company updated the fair value calculation of its reporting units, performed the quantitative impairment test and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company performed a qualitative impairment test and, based on the totality of information available for the reporting units, the Company concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair values of the reporting units were greater than the carrying values of the reporting units and, as such, no further analysis was required.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are recognized at fair value, as an asset apart from goodwill if the asset (i) arises from contractual or other legal rights, or (ii) is separable.  Intangible assets, principally representing the cost of customer-related intangibles, non-competition agreements and technology acquired, are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over their expected useful lives, which generally range from\nfive\nto\ntwenty years\n.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, consisting principally of acquired tradenames, are not amortized, but instead are periodically reviewed for impairment.\nF-12\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company reviews indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible is more than its estimated fair value.  The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test is performed at least annually, or more frequently in the case of other events that indicate a potential impairment.\nBased upon the Company’s most recent annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company concluded that indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.\nThe Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets (including amortizable intangible assets), other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  Evaluation of possible impairment is based on the Company's ability to recover the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations.  If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset.\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting), are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and include:\n•\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values which are comprised of participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation and related Company matching contributions held in trusts pursuant to the Company's supplemental deferred compensation plans (see Note 17).  These investments are measured at fair value with both realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in current earnings within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, gains and (losses) from these equity securities totaled $\n8\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion, and $(\n2\n) million, respectively.  The carrying value of these investments were $\n67\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nEquity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, which consist of investments in preferred and common shares of privately held companies.  These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.  The Company regularly evaluates these equity investments to determine if there are any indicators that the investment is impaired;\nno\nimpairment charges were recognized related to these investments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.  The carrying value of these investments was $\n25\nmillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n•\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities of privately-held companies.  These investments are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses presented in other comprehensive income (loss).  The carrying amount of these investments was $\n12\nmillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates and, from time to time, foreign currencies.  This strategy includes the use of interest rate swap agreements, forward-starting interest rate swap agreements, interest rate lock agreements and foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to movements in interest and currency rates.  The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities.  These policies prohibit holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments that contain credit risk-related contingent features or requirements to post collateral.\nF-13\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents and its debt obligations.  Interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate as interest rates change; however, due to their relatively short maturities, the Company does not hedge these assets or their investment cash flows and the impact of interest rate risk is not material.  The Company's debt obligations consist of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt instruments.  The Company's primary objective is to achieve the lowest overall cost of funding while managing the variability in cash outflows within an acceptable range.  In order to achieve this objective, the Company has historically entered into interest rate swap agreements.  Interest rate swap agreements involve the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts.  Net settlements between the counterparties are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense, net.\nThe Company accounts for these derivatives as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.  The fair value is based upon model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past, present and future market conditions.  For a derivative instrument that has been formally designated as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument along with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that are attributable to the risk being hedged are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  For derivatives that have been formally designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Upon maturity or early termination of an effective interest rate swap agreement designated as a cash flow hedge, unrealized gains or losses are deferred in stockholders' equity, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings, which is when the Company recognizes interest expense on the hedged cash flows.  At inception and quarterly thereafter, the Company formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.  After the initial quantitative assessment, this analysis is initially performed on a qualitative basis and, if it is determined that the hedging relationship was and continues to be highly effective, no further analysis is required.  All components of each derivative financial instrument's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses related to a discontinued cash flow hedge shall continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur.  If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the originally specified time period, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are classified into earnings immediately.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) encompasses all changes in stockholders' equity (except those arising from transactions with stockholders) and includes:\n•\nForeign currency translation adjustments;\n•\nNet changes in available-for-sale debt securities, which represent unrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities; and\n•\nNet deferred gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, which represent deferred gains (losses), net of tax, on interest rate-related derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, net of amounts reclassified to interest expense (see Notes 15 and 16).\nNew Accounting Standards\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") which aligns the requirements for deferring implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.  The adoption of this standard, which the Company elected to do on a prospective basis, did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by the FASB that changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new forward\nF-14\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nlooking approach, based on expected losses.  The estimate of expected credit losses requires entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The adoption of this new standard, which was done using a modified retrospective transition approach, did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  See \"Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\" in this footnote for further details on the Company's allowance for credit losses policy.\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted a new accounting standard issued by the FASB on accounting for leases using the modified retrospective method. This new accounting standard requires a lessee to recognize on its balance sheet an asset and liability for most leases. The Company elected the optional transition method that allowed for a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings recorded on January 1, 2019 and did not restate previously reported results in the comparative periods.  The Company also elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, allowed it to carry forward its historical lease classification.\nAs a result of adoption of the new standard, the Company recorded operating lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $\n500\nmillion and $\n550\nmillion, respectively as of January 1, 2019.  The operating lease liability was determined based on the present value of the remaining minimum rental payments and the operating lease asset was determined based on the value of the lease liability, adjusted for the deferred rent balances of approximately $\n50\nmillion, which were previously included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  Accounting for the Company's finance leases remained substantially unchanged.  The adoption of the new standard did not materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, the adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in increased qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For further details, see Note 14.\nNew Accounting Standards To Be Adopted\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform due to the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\").  The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.  The pronouncement is effective immediately and can be applied through December 31, 2022.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n3.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nDIS\nNet revenues in the Company’s DIS business accounted for greater than\n95\n% of the Company’s total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low-dollar transactions.  The DIS business, which provides clinical testing services and other services, satisfies its performance obligation and recognizes revenues primarily upon completion of the testing process (when results are reported) or when services have been rendered.  The Company estimates the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to receive from customer groups in exchange for providing services using the portfolio approach. These estimates include the impact of contractual allowances (including payer denials), and patient price concessions, as discussed below. The portfolios determined using the portfolio approach consist of the following groups of customers: healthcare insurers, government payers, client payers and patients.  Contracts with customers in the DIS business do not contain significant financing components based on the typical period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration.\nThe process for estimating revenues and the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant judgment and estimation.  The Company follows a standard process, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors (including the period the receivables have been outstanding), to estimate contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, recording adjustments in the current period as changes in estimates.  Further adjustments to the allowances, based on actual receipts, may be recorded upon settlement.\nF-15\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following are descriptions of the DIS business’ portfolios:\nHealthcare Insurers\nReimbursements from healthcare insurers are based on negotiated fee-for-service schedules and on capitated payment rates.  Under fee-for-service arrangements, healthcare insurers are billed at the Company's list price.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and the terms of the Company’s contractual arrangements.\nCollection of the Company's net revenues from healthcare insurers is normally a function of providing complete and correct billing information to the healthcare insurers within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within\n30\nto\n60\ndays of billing.  Provided the Company has billed healthcare insurers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, the Company determines if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and if so, it will reserve accordingly for the billing.\nUnder capitated arrangements with healthcare insurers, the Company recognizes revenue based on a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each member of an insurer's health plan regardless of the number or cost of services provided by the Company.  Healthcare insurers typically reimburse the Company under capitated arrangements in the same month services are performed, essentially giving rise to no outstanding accounts receivable at the end of a reporting period.  If any capitated payments are not received on a timely basis, the Company determines the cause and makes a separate determination as to whether or not the collection of the amount from the healthcare insurer is at risk and, if so, would reserve accordingly.\nGovernment Payers\nReimbursements from government payers are based on fee-for-service schedules set by governmental authorities, including traditional Medicare and Medicaid.  Net revenues recognized consist of amounts billed net of contractual allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from such payers, which considers historical denial and collection experience and other factors.\nCollection of the Company's net revenues from government payers is normally a function of providing the complete and correct billing information within the various filing deadlines and generally occurs within\n30\ndays of billing.  Provided the Company has billed government payers accurately with complete information prior to the established filing deadline, there has historically been little to no credit risk.  If there has been a delay in billing, the Company determines if the amounts in question will likely go past the filing deadline, and, if so, it will reserve for the billing accordingly.\nClient Payers\nClient payers include physicians, hospitals, ACOs, DCEs, IDNs, employers, other commercial laboratories and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis, and are billed based on negotiated fee schedules.  Credit risk and ability to pay are more of a consideration for these payers than healthcare insurers and government payers.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within\n60\nto\n90\ndays of billing.\nThe Company principally estimates the allowance for credit losses for client payers based on historical collection experience, the current credit worthiness of the customers, current economic conditions, expectations of future economic conditions and the period that the receivables have been outstanding. To the extent that any individual client payers are identified that have deteriorated in credit quality, the Company establishes allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customers.\nPatients\nF-16\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nUninsured patients are billed based on established patient fee schedules or fees negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients.  Insured patients (includes coinsurance and deductible responsibilities) are billed based on fees negotiated with healthcare insurers.  Collection of billings from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay.  Net revenues consist of amounts billed net of discounts provided to uninsured patients in accordance with the Company’s policies and implicit price concessions.  Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive from patients, which considers historical collection experience (including the period the receivables have been outstanding) and other factors including current market conditions. Patient billings are generally fully reserved for when the related billing reaches\n210\ndays outstanding.  Balances are automatically written off when they are sent to collection agencies.  Allowances are further adjusted for estimated recoveries of amounts sent to collection agencies based on historical collection experience, which is regularly monitored.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within\n30\nto\n60\ndays of billing.\nDS\nThe Company’s DS businesses primarily satisfy their performance obligations and recognize revenues when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.  Collection of consideration the Company expects to receive generally occurs within\n30\nto\n60\ndays of billing.\nThe approximate percentage of net revenue by type of customer was as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, substantially all of the Company’s services were provided within the United States, see Note 19.\nThe approximate percentage of net accounts receivable by type of customer as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nF-17\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table summarizes the activity for the Company's allowance for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020, which principally relates to client payers:\n4.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows (in millions, except per share data):\nThe following securities were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share due to their antidilutive effect:\n5.\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\nF-18\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nInvigorate Program\nThe Company is committed to a program called Invigorate which is designed to reduce its cost structure and improve performance.  Invigorate consists of several flagship programs, with structured plans in each, to drive savings and improve performance across the customer value chain.  These flagship programs include: organization excellence; information technology excellence; procurement excellence; service excellence; lab excellence; and revenue services excellence.  In addition to these programs, the Company identified key themes to change how it operates including reducing denials and patient price concessions; further digitizing the business; standardization and automation; and optimization initiatives in the areas of lab network and patient service center network. The Invigorate program is intended to partially offset reimbursement pressures and labor and benefit cost increases; free up additional resources to invest in science, innovation and other growth initiatives; and enable the Company to improve service quality and operating profitability.\nRestructuring Charges\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company's pre-tax restructuring charges for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe restructuring charges incurred for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2018 were primarily associated with various workforce reduction initiatives as the Company continued to simplify and restructure its organization.  The restructuring activity incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily represents a release of the liability relating to restructuring charges recorded in prior periods, which were determined to no longer be required.  Of the total restructuring charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, $\n9\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion were recorded in cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively.  The $(\n2\n) million of restructuring charges recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Of the total restructuring charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018, $\n22\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion were recorded in cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively.\nCharges for all periods presented were primarily recorded in the Company's DIS business.\nThe following table summarizes the activity of the restructuring liability during 2020 and 2019, which is included in accrued expenses in Note 12:\n6.\nBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\n2020 Acquisitions\nF-19\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nDuring 2020, the Company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $\n330\nmillion, net of cash acquired, including the acquisitions discussed below.  The 2020 acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $\n247\nmillion, of which $\n210\nmillion is deductible for tax purposes.  These acquisitions also resulted in $\n146\nmillion of intangible assets, principally comprised of customer-related and technology intangible assets.  Net revenues attributable to the 2020 acquisitions were $\n127\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAcquisition of Blueprint Genetics Oy\nOn January 21, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Blueprint Genetics Oy (\"Blueprint Genetics\"), in an all cash transaction for $\n108\nmillion, net of $\n3\nmillion cash acquired.  Blueprint Genetics is a leading specialty genetic testing company with expertise in gene variant interpretation based on next generation sequencing and proprietary bioinformatics.  Through the acquisition, the Company acquired all of Blueprint Genetics' operations.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company made an election to treat the acquisition as a taxable business combination for income tax purposes, which resulted in an adjustment to the preliminary purchase price allocation to reverse the previously recorded $\n11\nmillion deferred tax liability, with a corresponding decrease to goodwill. Based on the final purchase price allocation, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed primarily consist of $\n66\nmillion of tax-deductible goodwill, $\n43\nmillion of intangible assets, and $\n2\nmillion of property, plant and equipment and working capital.  The intangible assets primarily consist of technology and customer-related assets which are being amortized over a useful life of\n10\nyears and\n15\nyears, respectively.\nAcquisition of the Outreach Laboratory Services Business of Memorial Hermann Health System\nOn April 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of select assets which constitute substantially all of the operations of Memorial Hermann Diagnostic Laboratories, the outreach laboratory division of Memorial Hermann Health System (\"Memorial Hermann\"), in an all cash transaction for $\n120\nmillion.  Memorial Hermann is a not-for-profit health system in Southeast Texas.  Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, which may be revised as additional information becomes available during the measurement period, the assets acquired primarily consist of $\n27\nmillion of customer-related intangible assets and $\n93\nmillion of tax-deductible goodwill.  The intangible assets are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears.\nAcquisition of the Remaining\n56\n% Interest in Mid America Clinical Laboratories, LLC\nOn August 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the remaining\n56\n% interest in Mid America Clinical Laboratories, LLC (\"MACL\") from its joint venture partners in an all cash transaction for $\n93\nmillion, net of $\n18\nmillion cash acquired.  MACL is the largest independent clinical laboratory provider in Indiana.  Prior to the acquisition, the Company accounted for its\n44\n% interest in MACL as an equity method investment, which was remeasured to its fair value of $\n87\nmillion on the acquisition date, resulting in a gain of $\n70\nmillion that was recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.  The fair value of the previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account, among other items, MACL's expected future cash flows, long-term growth rate (\n1.5\n%), and a discount rate commensurate with economic risk (\n7.5\n%).  Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, which may be revised as additional information becomes available during the measurement period, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of $\n84\nmillion of goodwill (of which $\n47\nmillion is tax-deductible), $\n74\nmillion of intangible assets, $\n11\nmillion of working capital and $\n11\nmillion of property, plant and equipment.  The intangible assets consist of customer-related assets which are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears.  As a result of the acquisition, MACL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\n2019 Acquisitions\nDuring 2019, the Company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $\n63\nmillion, including the acquisition discussed below.  The 2019 acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $\n43\nmillion, of which $\n36\nmillion is deductible for tax purposes.  These acquisitions also resulted in $\n21\nmillion of intangible assets, principally comprised of customer-related intangibles.\nAcquisition of the Clinical Laboratory Services Business of Boyce & Bynum Pathology Laboratories, P.C.\nF-20\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nOn February 11, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets of the clinical laboratory services business of Boyce & Bynum Pathology Laboratories, P.C. (\"Boyce & Bynum\") in an all cash transaction for $\n61\nmillion, which consisted of cash consideration of $\n55\nmillion and contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n6\nmillion.  The contingent consideration arrangement was dependent upon the achievement of certain testing volume benchmarks.  During 2019, the liability was reduced to $\n0\nas a result of updated testing volume forecasts for the earn-out period compared to the testing volume target included in the contingent consideration arrangement, resulting in a $\n6\nmillion gain recorded in other operating expense (income), net.  Based on the purchase price allocation, the assets acquired principally consist of $\n41\nmillion of goodwill (of which $\n35\nmillion is tax deductible) and $\n20\nmillion of customer-related intangible assets.  The intangible assets are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears.\n2018 Acquisitions\nDuring 2018, the Company completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $\n440\nmillion, net of cash acquired, including the acquisitions discussed below.

(\"MedXM\"), a leading national provider of home-based health risk assessments and related services, in an all cash transaction for $\n142\nmillion, net of $\n5\nmillion cash acquired, which consisted of cash consideration of $\n130\nmillion and contingent consideration initially estimated at $\n12\nmillion.  The contingent consideration arrangement was dependent upon the achievement of certain revenue targets.  Subsequent to the acquisition, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was reduced to $\n0\nas a result of updated revenue forecasts for 2018 compared to the earn-out revenue target included in the contingent consideration arrangement, resulting in a $\n12\nmillion net gain recorded in other operating expense (income), net.  Through the acquisition, the Company acquired all of MedXM's operations.  The assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of $\n77\nmillion of intangible assets, $\n57\nmillion of goodwill (of which $\n45\nmillion is tax deductible), $\n7\nmillion of working capital and $\n1\nmillion of property, plant and equipment.

The assets acquired principally consist of goodwill, technology-related intangible assets and customer-related intangible assets.\nAcquisition of the U.S. Laboratory Services Business of Oxford Immunotec, Inc.\nOn November 6, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the operations of the U.S. laboratory services business of Oxford Immunotec, Inc. (\"Oxford\"), in an all cash transaction for $\n170\nmillion, net of $\n1\nmillion cash acquired.  The acquisition included laboratories in Tennessee and Massachusetts that provide tuberculosis and tick-borne disease testing services.  As part of the transaction, Oxford will sell test kits and related accessories to the Company under a long-term supply agreement.  In September 2019, the Company finalized its purchase price allocation and recorded a $\n13\nmillion increase to\nF-21\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\ngoodwill, an $\n11\nmillion decrease to intangible assets and a $\n2\nmillion adjustment to other assets and liabilities.  These adjustments did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations.  Based on the final purchase price allocation, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed primarily consist of $\n43\nmillion of intangible assets, $\n112\nmillion of tax deductible goodwill, $\n13\nmillion of working capital and $\n6\nmillion of property, plant and equipment.  The intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related and contract-related assets which are being amortized over a useful life of\n15\nyears and\n5\nyears, respectively.\nGeneral Information\nThe acquisitions described above were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  As such, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their estimated fair values as of the closing date.  Supplemental pro forma combined financial information has not been presented as the impact of the acquisitions is not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements.  The goodwill recorded primarily includes the expected synergies resulting from combining the operations of the acquired entities with those of the Company and the value associated with an assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.  All of the goodwill acquired in connection with these acquisitions has been allocated to the Company's DIS business.

A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are invested in a variety of participant-directed stock and bond mutual funds that are classified as trading securities.  The trading securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the changes in the fair value of these securities are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held, exclusive of any transaction costs.  A corresponding adjustment for changes in fair value of the trading securities is also reflected in the changes in fair value of the deferred compensation obligation.  The deferred compensation liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the trading securities.\nThe Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  The Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies, for the purpose of funding the program's liability.  Changes in the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are based upon earnings and changes in the value of the underlying investments.  Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation obligation are derived using quoted prices in active markets based on the\nF-23\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nmarket price per unit multiplied by the number of units.  The cash surrender value and the deferred compensation obligation are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to the hypothetical investments. Deferrals under the plan currently may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017.\nThe Company's available-for-sale debt securities are measured at fair value using discounted cash flows.  These fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is based on significant inputs that are not observable.  Significant inputs include cash flows projections and a discount rate.\nThe fair value measurements of the Company's fixed-to-variable interest rate swaps, which were terminated during April 2020 (see Note 15), were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, and were model-derived valuations as of a given date in which all significant inputs were observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past, present and future market conditions.\nIn connection with previous business acquisitions, the Company had contingent consideration obligations that were to be paid based on the achievement of certain testing volume or revenue benchmarks.  As of December 31, 2020,\nno\ncontingent consideration obligations were outstanding.  Contingent consideration liabilities are measured at fair value using an option-pricing method and are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is determined based on significant inputs that are not observable.  Significant inputs include management’s estimate of volume or revenue and other market inputs including comparable company revenue volatility and a discount rate.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of liabilities using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\nThe $\n1\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion net gains included in earnings associated with the changes in the fair value of contingent consideration for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are reported in other operating expense (income), net.\nIn connection with the sale of an\n18.9\n% noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass Memorial Medical Center (\"UMass\") on July 1, 2015, the Company granted UMass the right to require the Company to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was presented at its fair value.  The fair value measurement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that takes into account, among other items, the joint venture's expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, and a discount rate commensurate with economic risk.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short maturities of these instruments.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated at $\n4.6\nbillion and $\n5.1\nbillion, respectively.  Principally all of the Company's debt is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value of the debt is estimated based on rates currently offered to the Company with identical terms and maturities, using quoted active market prices and yields, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.\nF-24\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n8.\nTAXES ON INCOME\nThe Company's pre-tax income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of equity method investees consisted of approximately $\n1.9\nbillion, $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n0.9\nbillion from U.S. operations and pre-tax (loss) income of $(\n7\n) million, $\n15\nmillion and $(\n1\n) million from foreign operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company changed its assertion that it intends to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries outside the U.S.  The Company is indefinitely reinvested in the remaining basis difference and it is not practicable to determine the associated amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability.\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a $\n12\nmillion net income tax benefit due to the release of valuation allowances associated with certain net operating loss carryforwards.   In 2018, the Company filed for a tax return accounting method change, effective for the tax year ending December 31, 2017, to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses on its 2017 tax return at the higher 2017 federal corporate statutory income tax rate, resulting in a $\n15\nmillion income tax benefit.  The net income tax benefit associated with changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2018 was primarily related to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain income tax returns.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nF-25\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe non-current deferred tax assets (liabilities) disclosure at December 31, 2019 has been adjusted to separately state the gross deferred tax right-of-use asset and related gross deferred tax lease liability recognized in accordance with the new accounting standard for leases adopted on January 1, 2019.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, non-current deferred tax liabilities of $\n350\nmillion and $\n264\nmillion, respectively, are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had estimated net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $\n60\nmillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively, which expire at various dates through 2040.  Estimated net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes are $\n76\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, some of which can be carried forward indefinitely while others expire at various dates through 2040.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards of $\n94\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion, respectively, have each been reduced by valuation allowances of $\n33\nmillion and $\n26\nmillion, respectively.\nIncome taxes payable, including those classified as long-term in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, were $\n135\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion, respectively.  Prepaid income taxes were $\n2\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following:\nThe contingent liabilities for tax positions primarily relate to uncertainties associated with the realization of tax benefits derived from the allocation of income and expense among state jurisdictions, the characterization and timing of certain tax deductions associated with business combinations, certain tax credits and the deductibility of certain expenses and settlement payments.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is $\n75\nmillion.  Based upon the expiration of statutes of limitations, settlements and/or the conclusion of tax examinations, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $\n15\nmillion within the next twelve months.\nF-26\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nAccruals for interest expense on contingent tax liabilities are classified in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.  Accruals for penalties have historically been immaterial.  Interest expense included in income tax expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $\n6\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had approximately $\n21\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion, respectively, accrued, net of the benefit of a federal and state deduction, for the payment of interest on uncertain tax positions.\nThe recognition and measurement of certain tax benefits includes estimates and judgment by management and inherently involves subjectivity.  Changes in estimates may create volatility in the Company's effective tax rate in future periods and may be due to settlements with various tax authorities (either favorable or unfavorable), the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax positions and obtaining new information about particular tax positions that may cause management to change its estimates.\nIn the regular course of business, various federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities conduct examinations of the Company's income tax filings and the Company generally remains subject to examination until the statute of limitations expires for the respective jurisdiction.  The Internal Revenue Service has either completed its examinations of the Company's consolidated federal income tax returns or the statute of limitations has expired up through and including the 2016 tax year.  At this time, the Company does not believe that there will be any material additional payments beyond its recorded contingent liability reserves that may be required as a result of these tax audits.

Under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility, the Company can borrow against a $\n250\nmillion loan commitment maturing October 2021 and a $\n250\nmillion loan commitment maturing October 2022, and can issue up to $\n100\nmillion of letters of credit (see Note 18) through October 2022.  Borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility are collateralized by certain domestic receivables.  As of December 31, 2020, interest on the borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility was based on either commercial paper rates for highly-rated issuers or LIBOR, plus a spread of\n0.825\n% to\n0.95\n%.  The Secured Receivables Credit Facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility.  As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility.\nF-31\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Company is party to a $\n750\nmillion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility” or \"Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility\") which matures in March 2023.  Under the Credit Facility, the Company can issue letters of credit totaling $\n150\nmillion (see Note 18).  Issued letters of credit reduce the available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility.  Interest on the Credit Facility is based on certain published rates plus an applicable margin based on changes in the Company's public debt ratings and its leverage ratio.  At the option of the Company, it may elect to lock into LIBOR-based interest rates for periods up to six months.  Interest on any outstanding amounts not covered under LIBOR-based interest rate contracts is based on an alternate base rate, which is calculated by reference to the prime rate, the federal funds rate or an adjusted LIBOR rate.  As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company's borrowing rate for LIBOR-based loans under the Credit Facility was LIBOR plus\n1.125\n%.  The Credit Facility contains various covenants, including the maintenance of a financial leverage ratio, which could impact the Company's ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness.  In April 2020, the Company amended the Credit Facility to provide increased covenant flexibility.\nAs amended, the leverage ratio covenant (as defined in the Credit Facility) was increased as follows:\nThereafter, the leverage ratio covenant reverts to no more than\n3.5\ntimes EBITDA.  During the period that the increased covenant applies, which period may be terminated early by the Company provided that the Company is in compliance with the historical\n3.5\ntimes EBITDA leverage ratio, the amended Credit Facility contains certain additional limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, repurchases of the Company's common stock, the amount of funds that can be used on business acquisitions, the incurrence of secured indebtedness and the payment of dividends.\nAs of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all covenants for its credit facilities.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $\n1.3\nbillion of borrowing capacity available under the facilities, including $\n530\nmillion available under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility and $\n750\nmillion available under the Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.\nF-32\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nSenior Notes Offerings\nIn May 2020, the Company completed a senior notes offering, consisting of $\n550\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n2.80\n% senior notes due June 2031 (the “2031 Senior Notes”), which were issued at an original issue discount of $\n1\nmillion.  The Company incurred $\n5\nmillion of debt issuance costs associated with the 2031 Senior Notes, which are included as a reduction to the carrying amount of long-term debt and which are being amortized over the term of the related debt.\nDuring November 2020, the net proceeds from the 2031 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem in full the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's senior notes due April 2021.\nIn December 2019, the Company completed a senior notes offering, consisting of $\n800\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n2.95\n% senior notes due June 2030 (the \"2030 Senior Notes\"), which were issued at an original issue discount of $\n2\nmillion.  The Company incurred $\n7\nmillion of debt issuance costs associated with the 2030 Senior Notes, which are included as a reduction to the carrying amount of long-term debt and which are being amortized over the term of the related debt.\nDuring January 2020, the net proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem in full the outstanding indebtedness under the Company's senior notes due January 2020 and senior notes due March 2020.\nIn March 2019, the Company completed a senior notes offering, consisting of $\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.20\n% senior notes due June 2029 (the \"2029 Senior Notes\"), which were issued at an original issue discount of $\n1\nmillion.

None of the Company's senior notes have a sinking fund requirement.\nThe Company may redeem its outstanding senior notes prior to scheduled maturity, as a whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, except for certain notes for which the Company also has an option to redeem such instruments at par value on or after dates specified in the indentures governing the notes (\"the par value redemption option\").  For notes with the par value redemption option, if such notes are redeemed prior to the specified dates, the redemption price calculations exclude any interest that would have been due after such dates.\nF-33\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nMaturities of Long-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2020, long-term debt matures as follows:\nF-34\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n14.\nLEASES\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company leases office space, patient service centers, clinical laboratories, warehouses, logistic hubs and equipment primarily through operating leases, with a limited number of finance leases. A right-of-use asset, representing the underlying asset during the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the payment obligation arising from the lease, are recognized on the balance sheet at lease commencement based on the present value of the payment obligation. For operating leases, expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, interest expense on the lease liability is recognized using the effective interest method and amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.  Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, lease expense associated with short-term leases was not material.\nThe Company primarily uses its collateralized incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments as the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate.  Such incremental borrowing rates, which take into account interest rates offered to companies that have similar credit ratings to the Company, are determined using a portfolio approach which groups the Company’s leases based on tenor.\nThe Company has lease agreements with (i) right-of-use asset payments and (ii) non-lease components (i.e., payments related to maintenance fees, utilities, etc.) which have been combined and accounted for as a single lease component.\nThe Company's leases have remaining terms of less than\n1\nyear to\n16\nyears, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to\n15\nyears. The Company's lease terms may include renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised and termination options that are reasonably certain not to be exercised. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property.\nCertain of the Company's lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation or a market rate which are included in the lease liabilities.\nThe Company's assets and liabilities for its lease agreements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(a) Finance lease assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were recorded net of accumulated amortization of $\n14\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion, respectively.\nF-35\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nComponents of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(a) Includes short-term leases and variable lease costs (primarily usage-based maintenance fees and utilities related to real estate leases and certain equipment-related and vehicle-related costs) of $\n120\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nRental expense for real estate, laboratory equipment and vehicles under operating leases amounted to $\n220\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe maturity of the Company's lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nLease term and discount rate as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nThe Company's discount rates for its operating leases were primarily determined using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.  The Company's weighted-average discount rate for its finance leases principally reflects the implicit interest rate on a lease obligation assumed in a business combination.\nSee Note 9 for cash flow information on cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities, leased assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities, and leased assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nF-36\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\n15.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nInterest Rate Derivatives – Cash Flow Hedges\nFrom time to time, the Company has entered into various interest rate lock agreements and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge part of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates.\nDuring March 2020, the Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution for a total notional amount of $\n25\nmillion.  Additionally, during May 2020, the Company entered into interest rate lock agreements with several financial institutions for a total notional amount of $\n275\nmillion.  The forward-starting interest rate swap agreement and the interest rate lock agreements were entered into in order to hedge a portion of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates over a\nten\n-year period related to an anticipated issuance of debt and were accounted for as cash flow hedges.  In connection with the issuance of the 2031 Senior Notes (see Note 13), these agreements were settled and the Company received net proceeds of $\n1\nmillion. The net gain is deferred in stockholders' equity, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and is being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense, net over a\nten\n-year period.\nThe total net loss, net of taxes, recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, related to the Company's cash flow hedges was $\n1\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The net amount of deferred losses on cash flow hedges that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense, net within the next twelve months is $\n1\nmillion.\nInterest Rate Derivatives – Fair Value Hedges\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had various fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $\n1.2\nbillion, which were entered into in order to convert a portion of the Company's long-term debt into variable interest rate debt.  In April 2020, the Company terminated these existing fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements and received proceeds of $\n40\nmillion.  Such amount was reflected as a basis adjustment to the hedged debt instruments and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense, net over their remaining terms.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges included in the carrying amount of long-term debt:\n(a) As of December 31, 2020, the entire balance is associated with remaining unamortized hedging adjustments on discounted relationships.  As of December 31, 2019, the balance includes $\n25\nmillion of remaining unamortized hedging adjustments on discontinued relationships.\nF-37\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table presents the effect of fair value hedge accounting on the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively:\nA summary of the fair values of derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet was as follows:\n16.\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nStockholders' Equity\nSeries Preferred Stock\nQuest Diagnostics is authorized to issue up to\n10\nmillion shares of Series Preferred Stock, par value $\n1.00\nper share.

During each of the four quarters of 2019, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.53\nper common share.  During each of the first three quarters of 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.50\nper common share.  During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.53\nper common share.  On February 4, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a\n10.7\n% increase in its quarterly cash dividend from $\n0.56\nto $\n0.62\nper share, or $\n2.48\nper share annually, commencing with the dividend payable in April 2021.\nF-39\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nShare Repurchase Program\nAs of December 31, 2020, $\n0.9\nbillion remained available under the Company’s share repurchase authorization.  In February 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an additional $\n1\nbillion of the Company's common stock.  The share repurchase authorization has no set expiration or termination date.\nShare Repurchases\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, the Company repurchased\n2.7\nmillion shares of its common stock for $\n325\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased\n3.5\nmillion shares of its common stock for $\n350\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased\n3.4\nmillion shares of its common stock for $\n325\nmillion, which included an accrual of $\n3\nmillion recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet for share repurchases not settled until after December 31, 2018.\nShares Reissued from Treasury Stock\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company reissued\n3\nmillion shares,\n2\nmillion shares and\n3\nmillion shares, respectively, from treasury stock for shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") and stock option plans.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nIn connection with the sale of an\n18.9\n% noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to UMass on July 1, 2015, the Company granted UMass the right to require the Company to purchase all of its interest in the subsidiary at fair value commencing July 1, 2020.  The subsidiary performs diagnostic information services in a defined territory within the state of Massachusetts.  Since the redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of the Company's control, it has been presented outside of stockholders' equity at the greater of its carrying amount or its fair value.  The Company records changes in the fair value of the noncontrolling interest immediately as they occur.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was $\n82\nmillion and $\n76\nmillion, respectively, and was presented at its fair value.\n17.\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP AND COMPENSATION PLANS\nEmployee and Non-employee Directors Stock Ownership Programs\nThe ELTIP provides for three types of awards: (a) stock options, (b) stock appreciation rights and (c) stock awards.  The ELTIP provides for the grant to eligible employees of either non-qualified or incentive stock options, or both, to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Grants of stock appreciation rights allow eligible employees to receive a payment based on the appreciation of Company common stock in cash, shares of Company common stock or a combination thereof.  The stock appreciation rights are granted at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the ELTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than\nten years\nfrom date of grant.  No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the ELTIP.  Under the ELTIP, awards are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the end of the vesting period prescribed by the Board of Directors.  For all award types, the vesting period is generally over\nthree years\nfrom the date of grant.  For performance share units, the actual amount of shares earned is based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards.  The performance goals for awards granted for 2018 and 2019 were based on the financial performance of the Company.  The performance goals for awards granted in 2020 were based on the financial performance of the Company as well as relative TSR.  The maximum number of shares of Company common stock in respect of which awards may be granted under the ELTIP is approximately\n79\nmillion shares.\nThe DLTIP provides for the grant to non-employee directors of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Company common stock at an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  The DLTIP also permits awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units to non-employee directors.  Stock options\nF-40\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\ngranted under the DLTIP expire on the date designated by the Board of Directors but in no event more than\nten years\nfrom date of grant.  For all award types, the vesting period is generally over\nthree years\nfrom the date of grant, regardless of whether the award recipient remains a director of the Company.  The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the DLTIP is\n2.4\nmillion shares.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, grants under the DLTIP totaled\n14\nthousand shares,\n14\nthousand shares and\n15\nthousand shares, respectively.\nThe Company's practice has been to issue shares related to its stock-based compensation program from shares of its common stock held in treasury or by issuing new shares of its common stock.  See Note 16 for further information regarding the Company's share repurchase program.\nThe fair value of each stock option award granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-valuation model.  The expected volatility under the Black-Scholes option-valuation model was based on historical volatilities of the Company's common stock.  The dividend yield was based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the expected holding period of the related award.  The expected holding period was estimated using the historical stock option exercise behavior of employees.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in valuing stock options granted in the periods presented were:\nThe following summarizes the activity relative to stock option awards for 2020:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company's closing common stock price on the last trading day of 2020 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2020.  This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock.  Total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n113\nmillion, $\n62\nmillion and $\n67\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $\n9\nmillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.6\nyears.\nF-41\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant.  For performance share units with a goal based on the financial performance of the Company, the fair value is based on the average market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant, adjusted for the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company's common stock during the vesting period.  For performance share units with a market-based relative TSR goal, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.  The expected volatility under the Monte Carlo valuation model is based on the historical volatility of the common stock of the Company and the common stock of the companies in the peer index.  The dividend yield is based on the approved annual dividend rate in effect and current market price of the underlying common stock at the time of grant.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for bonds with maturities consistent with the performance period of the related award.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in valuing performance share units in 2020 with a market-based relative TSR goal were:\nThe following summarizes the activity relative to stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance share units, for 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $\n29\nmillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.5\nyears.  Total fair value of shares vested was $\n37\nmillion, $\n40\nmillion and $\n54\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  For performance share units with a goal based on financial performance of the Company, the amount of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is subject to change based on changes, if any, to management's best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that will be earned at the end of the performance periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, stock-based compensation expense totaled $\n97\nmillion, $\n56\nmillion and $\n61\nmillion, respectively.  Income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations related to stock-based compensation expense totaled $\n39\nmillion, $\n27\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which includes excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation arrangements of $\n23\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nF-42\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company's ESPP, substantially all employees can elect to have up to\n10\n% of their annual wages withheld to purchase Quest Diagnostics common stock.  The purchase price of the stock is\n95\n% of the market price of the Company's common stock on the last business day of each calendar month.  Under the ESPP, the maximum number of shares of Quest Diagnostics common stock which may be purchased by eligible employees is\n9\nmillion.  Approximately\n225\nthousand shares,\n269\nthousand shares and\n326\nthousand shares of common stock were purchased by eligible employees in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company maintains qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all of its employees.  The maximum Company matching contribution is\n5\n% of eligible employee compensation.  During 2020, the Company temporarily suspended matching contributions for certain qualified defined contribution plans; matching contributions were reinstated in the third quarter of 2020.  The Company's expense for contributions to its defined contribution plans aggregated $\n64\nmillion, $\n84\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSupplemental Deferred Compensation Plans\nThe Company has a supplemental deferred compensation plan that is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that provides for certain management and highly compensated employees to defer up to\n50\n% of their salary in excess of their defined contribution plan limits and for certain eligible employees, up to\n95\n% of their variable incentive compensation.  The maximum Company matching contribution is\n5\n% of eligible employee compensation.  During 2020, the Company temporarily suspended matching contributions; matching contributions were reinstated in the third quarter of 2020.  The compensation deferred under this plan, together with Company matching amounts, are credited with earnings or losses measured by the mirrored rate of return on investments elected by plan participants.  Each plan participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation, Company match and earnings credited to their account.  The amounts accrued under the Company's deferred compensation plans were $\n67\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Although the Company is currently contributing all participant deferrals and matching amounts to a trust, the funds in this trust, totaling $\n67\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are general assets of the Company and are subject to any claims of the Company's creditors.\nThe Company also offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation program.  The Company matches employee contributions equal to\n25\n%, up to a maximum of $\n5\nthousand per plan year.  A participant's deferrals, together with Company matching credits, are “invested” at the direction of the employee in a hypothetical portfolio of investments which are tracked by an administrator.  Each participant is fully vested in their deferred compensation and vests in Company matching contributions over a period of\nfour years\nat\n25\n% per year.  This plan was amended effective January 1, 2018 so that future deferrals under the plan may only be made by participants who made deferrals under the plan in 2017.  The amounts accrued under this plan were $\n59\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The Company purchases life insurance policies, with the Company named as beneficiary of the policies, for the purpose of funding the program's liability.  The cash surrender value of such life insurance policies was $\n50\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company's expense for matching contributions to these plans was not material.\n18.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLetters of Credit and Contractual Obligations\nThe Company can issue letters of credit under its Secured Receivables Credit Facility and Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 13).  In support of its risk management program, to ensure the Company’s performance or payment to third parties, $\n70\nmillion in letters of credit under the Secured Receivables Credit Facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2020.  The letters of credit primarily represent collateral for current and future automobile liability and workers’ compensation loss payments.\nF-43\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe Company has certain noncancelable commitments, primarily under take-or-pay arrangements, to purchase products or services from various suppliers, mainly for consulting and other service agreements, and standing orders to purchase reagents and other laboratory supplies.  As of December 31, 2020, the approximate total future purchase commitments are $\n334\nmillion, of which $\n106\nmillion are expected to be incurred in 2021, $\n103\nmillion are expected to be incurred in 2022 through 2023 and the balance thereafter.\nBilling and Collection Agreement\nIn September 2016, the Company entered into a\nten\n-year agreement with a third party to outsource its billing and  related operations for the majority of the Company’s revenues.  Services under the agreement commenced during the fourth quarter of 2016.  The agreement includes an annual fee, which is subject to adjustment based on certain changes in the Company's requisition volume and the achievement of various performance metrics.\nContingent Lease Obligations\nThe Company remains subject to contingent obligations under certain real estate leases, including real estate leases that were entered into by certain predecessor companies of a subsidiary prior to the Company's acquisition of the subsidiary.  While over the course of many years, the title to certain properties and interest in the subject leases have been transferred to third parties and the subject leases have been amended several times by such third parties, the lessors have not formally released the subsidiary predecessor companies from their original obligations under the leases and therefore remain contingently liable in the event of default.  The remaining terms of the lease obligations and the Company's corresponding indemnifications range up to\n27\nyears.  The lease payments under certain leases are subject to market value adjustments and contingent rental payments and therefore, the total contingent obligations under the leases cannot be precisely determined but are likely to total several hundred million dollars.  A claim against the Company would be made only upon the current lessee's default and, in certain cases, after a series of claims and corresponding defaults by third parties that precede the Company in the order of liability.  The Company also has certain indemnification rights from other parties to recover losses in the event of default on the lease obligations.  The Company believes that the likelihood of its performance under these contingent obligations is remote and no liability has been recorded for any potential payments under the contingent lease obligations.\nCertain Legal Matters\nThe Company may incur losses associated with these proceedings and investigations, but it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss, if any, that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other resolution of these proceedings and investigations based on the stage of these proceedings and investigations, the absence of specific allegations as to alleged damages, the uncertainty as to the certification of a class or classes and the size of any certified class, if applicable, and/or the lack of resolution of significant factual and legal issues.\nThe Company has insurance coverage rights in place (limited in amount; subject to deductible) for certain potential costs and liabilities related to these proceedings and investigations.\n401(k) Plan Lawsuit\nIn 2020,\ntwo\nputative class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and other defendants with respect to the Company’s 401(k) plan. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the fiduciaries of the 401(k) plan breached their duties by failing to disclose the expenses and risks of plan investment options, allowing unreasonable administration expenses to be charged to plan participants, and selecting and retaining high cost and poor performing investments.  In October 2020, the court consolidated the\ntwo\nlawsuits under the caption\nIn re: Quest Diagnostics ERISA Litigation\nand plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint.  The Company plans to vigorously defend this matter and has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.\nAMCA Data Security Incident\nF-44\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nOn June 3, 2019, the Company reported that Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc./American Medical Collection Agency (“AMCA”) had informed the Company and Optum360 LLC that an unauthorized user had access to AMCA’s system between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019 (the “AMCA Data Security Incident”).  Optum360 provides revenue management services to the Company, and AMCA provided debt collection services to Optum360.  AMCA first informed the Company of the AMCA Data Security Incident on May 14, 2019.  AMCA’s affected system included financial information (e.g., credit card numbers and bank account information), medical information and other personal information (e.g., social security numbers). Test results were not included.  Neither Optum360’s nor the Company’s systems or databases were involved in the incident. AMCA also informed the Company that information pertaining to other laboratories’ customers was also affected.  Following announcement of the AMCA Data Security Incident, AMCA sought protection under the U.S. bankruptcy laws.  The bankruptcy proceeding has been dismissed.\nNumerous putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company related to the AMCA Data Security Incident.  The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the cases still pending to, and consolidated them for pre-trial proceedings in, the U.S. District Court for New Jersey.  In November 2019, the plaintiffs in the multidistrict proceeding filed a consolidated putative class action complaint against the Company and Optum360 that named additional individuals as plaintiffs and that asserted a variety of common law and statutory claims in connection with the AMCA Data Security Incident.  In January 2020, the Company moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint; the motion to dismiss is pending.\nIn addition, certain federal and state governmental authorities are investigating, or otherwise seeking information and/or documents from the Company related to the AMCA Data Security Incident and related matters, including the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Attorneys General offices from numerous states and the District of Columbia, and certain U.S. senators.\nOther Legal Matters\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with the Company's activities as a provider of diagnostic testing, information and services.  These actions could involve claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, and could have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.\nThe Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental agencies regarding the Company's business which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nThe federal or state governments may bring claims based on the Company's current practices, which it believes are lawful.  In addition, certain federal and state statutes, including the\nqui tam\nprovisions of the federal False Claims Act, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government or private payers.  The Company is aware of lawsuits, and from time to time has received subpoenas, related to billing practices based on the qui tam provisions of the Civil False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes, regulations or other laws.  The Company understands that there may be other pending qui tam claims brought by former employees or other \"whistle blowers\" as to which the Company cannot determine the extent of any potential liability.\nManagement cannot predict the outcome of such matters.  Although management does not anticipate that the ultimate outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, given the high degree of judgment involved in establishing loss estimates related to these types of matters, the outcome of such matters may be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the impact of such matters is determined or paid.\nF-45\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThese matters are in different stages.  Some of these matters are in their early stages.  Matters may involve responding to and cooperating with various government investigations and related subpoenas.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not believe that material losses related to legal matters are probable.\nReserves for legal matters totaled $\n1\nmillion as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nReserves for General and Professional Liability Claims\nAs a general matter, providers of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims.  These suits could involve claims for substantial damages.  Any professional liability litigation could also have an adverse impact on the Company's client base and reputation.  The Company maintains various liability insurance coverages for, among other things, claims that could result from providing, or failing to provide, clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results, and other exposures.  The Company's insurance coverage limits its maximum exposure on individual claims; however, the Company is essentially self-insured for a significant portion of these claims.  Reserves for such matters, including those associated with both asserted and incurred but not reported claims, are established on an undiscounted basis by considering actuarially determined losses based upon the Company's historical and projected loss experience.  Such reserves totaled $\n138\nmillion and $\n132\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.  Management believes that established reserves and present insurance coverage are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures.\n19.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company's DIS business is the only reportable segment based on the manner in which the Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), assesses performance and allocates resources across the organization.  The DIS business provides diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers, including patients, clinicians, hospitals, IDNs, health plans, employers, ACOs, and DCEs.  The Company is the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services, which includes providing information and insights based on the industry-leading menu of routine, non-routine and advanced clinical testing and anatomic pathology testing, and other diagnostic information services.  The DIS business accounted for greater than\n95\n% of net revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAll other operating segments include the Company's DS businesses, which consist of its risk assessment services and healthcare information technology businesses.  The Company's DS businesses are the leading provider of risk assessment services for the life insurance industry and offer healthcare organizations and clinicians robust information technology solutions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, substantially all of the Company’s services were provided within the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s assets were located within the United States.\nF-46\nQUEST DIAGNOSTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED\n(in millions unless otherwise indicated)\nThe following table is a summary of segment information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
