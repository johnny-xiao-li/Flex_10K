    "text": "Overview\nCognizant is one of the world’s leading professional services companies, engineering modern business for the digital era. Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Digital services have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. We are focused on continued investment in four key areas of digital: IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers.\nDuring 2020, we announced the Cognizant Agenda which articulates our purpose, vision and values.\nIn order to achieve this vision and support our clients, we are focusing our business on four strategic priorities to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth. These strategic priorities include:\n•\nAccelerating digital - growing our digital business organically and inorganically;\n•\nGlobalizing Cognizant - growing our business in key international markets and diversifying leadership, capabilities and delivery footprint;\n•\nRepositioning our brand - improving global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire C-suite; and\n•\nIncreasing our relevance to our clients - leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients' business needs.\nWe seek to drive organic growth through investments in our digital capabilities across industries and geographies, including the extensive training and reskilling of our technical teams and the expansion of our local workforces in the United States and other markets around the world. Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances that can expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries. In 2020, we completed nine such acquisitions. See\nto our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCertain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the\nincluded at the end of\n.\nBusiness Segments\nWe go to market across our four industry-based business segments. Our clients seek to partner with service providers that have a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, customers, markets and cultures and the ability to create solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. Across industries, our clients are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by nimble, digital-native competitors. They are therefore redirecting their focus and investment to digital operating models and embracing DevOps and key technologies that enable quick adjustments to shifts in their markets. We believe that our deep knowledge of the industries we serve and our clients’ businesses has been central to our growth and high client satisfaction, and we continue to invest in those digital capabilities that help to enable our clients to become modern businesses.\n1\nOur business segments are as follows:\nOur Financial Services segment includes banking, capital markets and insurance companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ business needs for serving their customers while being compliant with significant regulatory requirements and adaptable to regulatory change, as well as our clients' adoption and integration of digital technologies, including customer experience enhancement, robotic process automation, analytics and AI in areas such as digital lending, fraud detection and next generation payments. In addition to platforms that drive outcomes at speed, demand is also created by our clients’ desire for less complexity through packaged solutions and suppliers with embedded product partners.\nOur Healthcare segment consists of healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies. Demand in this segment is driven by emerging industry trends, including enhanced compliance, integrated health management, claims investigative services and heightened focus on patient experience, as well as services that drive operational improvements in areas such as claims processing, enrollment, membership and billing. Demand is also created by the adoption and integration of digital technologies such as AI to shape personalized care plans and predictive data analytics to improve patient outcomes.\nOur Products and Resources segment includes manufacturers, retailers and travel and hospitality companies, as well as companies providing logistics, energy and utility services. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ focus on improving the efficiency of their operations, the enablement and integration of mobile platforms to support sales and other omni-channel commerce initiatives, and their adoption and integration of digital technologies, such as the application of intelligent systems to manage supply chains and enhance overall customer experiences, and IoT to instrument functions for factories, real estate, fleets and products to increase access to insight-generating data.\nOur Communications, Media and Technology segment includes information, media and entertainment, communications and technology companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ needs to create differentiated user experiences, transition to agile development methodologies, enhance their networks, manage their digital content and adopt and integrate digital technologies, such as cloud, interactive and IoT. During 2020, we exited certain content-related work within this segment that was not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the Company. Refer to\nfor further information.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the distribution of our revenues across our four industry-based business segments was as follows:\nThe services we provide are distributed among a number of clients in each of our business segments. A loss of a significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. The services we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. Nevertheless, the volume of work performed for specific clients may vary significantly from year to year.\nSee\nto our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to disaggregation of revenues by client location, service line and contract-type for each of our business segments.\n2\nServices and Solutions\nOur services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application services, systems integration, infrastructure services and business process services. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products and platforms. Central to our strategy to align with our clients’ need to modernize is our continued investment in four key areas of digital: IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud. These four capabilities enable clients to put data at the core of their operations, improve the experiences they offer to their customers, tap into new revenue streams, defend against technology-enabled competitors and reduce costs. In many cases, our clients' new digital systems are built on the backbone of their existing legacy systems. The demand for digital capabilities has continued to increase since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of increased demand for mobile workplace solutions, e-commerce, automation and AI and cybersecurity services and solutions. We believe our deep knowledge of our clients' infrastructure and systems provides us with a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities to make their operations more efficient, effective and modern. We deliver all of our services and solutions across our four industry-based business segments to best address our clients' individual needs.\nIn 2020, our services and solutions were organized into three practice areas: Digital Business, Digital Systems and Technology and Digital Business Operations. In January 2021, we strategically combined the Digital Business practice with the Digital Systems and Technology practice to create the new Digital Business & Technology practice. The objective of this change is to simplify our model and align it with the current state of technology.\nOur consulting professionals work closely with our practice areas to create modern frameworks, platforms and solutions that leverage a wide range of digital technologies across our clients’ businesses to deliver higher levels of efficiency and new value for their customers.\nDigital Business & Technology\nOur Digital Business & Technology practice helps clients build modern enterprises that deliver exceptional customer experiences that are created at the intersection of cloud and digital. Our clients are able to embrace a new business and technology stack that comprises consumer-grade software, enterprise applications, modernized data and the instrumentation of everything in cloud-first architectures. Combining a technology vision, strategy, roadmap, capabilities, solutions, partnerships, and subject matter expertise, Digital Business & Technology is an integrated growth enabler for commercial markets. Areas of focus within this practice area are:\n•\nInteractive, which leverages our global network of studios that help clients craft new experiences;\n•\napplication modernization, which updates legacy applications using agile methodologies and cloud;\n•\nAI and analytics, which drive business growth and efficiencies through a greater understanding of customers and operations;\n•\nIoT, which unlocks greater productivity and new business models;\n•\ndigital advisory, which provides enterprise transformation expertise;\n•\nexperience-driven software engineering, which designs, engineers and delivers modern business software;\n•\napplication services;\n•\nquality engineering and assurance; and\n•\ncloud, infrastructure and security.\nDigital Business Operations\nOur Digital Business Operations practice helps clients rethink their operating models by assessing their existing processes and recommending automation. This allows clients to fundamentally transform their processes while realizing cost savings benefits from these improvements. Areas of focus within this practice area are:\n•\nautomation, analytics and consulting for business process outsourcing;\n•\nplatform-based operations; and\n•\ncore business process operations.\nWe have extensive knowledge of core front office, middle office and back office processes, including finance and accounting, research and analytics, procurement and data management, which we integrate with our industry and technology expertise to deliver targeted business process services and solutions.\n3\nGlobal Delivery Model\nWe utilize a global delivery model, with delivery centers worldwide to provide our full range of services to our clients. Our delivery model includes employees deployed at client sites, local or in-country delivery centers, regional delivery centers and offshore delivery centers, as required to best serve our clients. As we scale our digital services and solutions, we are focused on hiring in the United States and other countries where we deliver services to our clients to expand our in-country delivery capabilities. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure are designed to enable the effective collaboration of our global workforce across locations and geographies.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, cloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment companies, infrastructure management companies, outsourcing companies and boutique digital companies. Our direct competitors include, among others, Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, EPAM Systems, Genpact, HCL Technologies, IBM Global Services, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.\nThe principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include the provider’s reputation and experience, strategic advisory capabilities, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs, financial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services. Accordingly, we rely on the following to compete effectively:\n•\ninvestments to scale our digital services;\n•\nour recruiting, training and retention model;\n•\nour global delivery model;\n•\nan entrepreneurial culture and approach to our work;\n•\na broad client referral base;\n•\ninvestment in process improvement and knowledge capture;\n•\nfinancial stability and good corporate governance;\n•\ncontinued focus on responsiveness to client needs, quality of services and competitive prices; and\n•\nproject management capabilities and technical expertise.\nIntellectual Property\nWe provide value to our clients based, in part, on our proprietary innovations, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other IP assets. We recognize the importance of IP and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. We seek IP protection for many of our innovations and rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our IP. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our brands, including our Cognizant brand, which is one of our most valuable assets. We own or are licensed under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights of varying duration, relating to our products and services. We also have policies requiring our associates to respect the IP rights of others. While our proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular IP right or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses, other than our Cognizant brand.\nCognizant® and other trademarks appearing in this report are registered trademarks or trademarks of Cognizant and its affiliates in the United States and other countries, or third parties, as applicable.\nWorkforce\nWe had approximately 289,500 employees at the end of 2020, with 43,500 in North America, 13,400 in Continental Europe, 6,800 in the United Kingdom and 225,800 in various other locations throughout the rest of the world, including 204,500 in India. This represents a decrease of 3,000 employees as compared to December 31, 2019. W\ne utilize subcontractors to provide additional capacity and flexibility in meeting client demand, though the number of subcontractors has historically been immaterial relative to our employee headcount. We are not party to any significant collective bargaining agr\neements.\n4\nWe balance the portion of our employees in the United States and other jurisdictions that rely on visas with consideration of the needs of our business to fulfill client demand and risks to our business from potential changes in immigration laws and regulations that may increase the costs associated with and ability to staff employees on visas to work in-country.\nEngaging Our People\nAs a global professional services company, Cognizant competes on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of its employees and the value they can provide to our clients. We aim for our employees to feel motivated, engaged, and empowered to do their best work through careers they find meaningful. In a market where competition for skilled IT professionals is intense, we focus on the following:\n•\nAdvancing Diversity & Inclusion:\nWe believe diversity and inclusion are at the heart of our ability to execute successfully and consistently over the long term. A diverse and inclusive workforce strengthens our ability to innovate and to understand our clients’ needs and aspirations.\nHighlights from our diversity & inclusion efforts include:\n–\nOur Global D&I organization is embedded within HR’s Talent & Transformation function to drive accountability through our people processes and systems;\n–\nGlobal D&I training and programs;\n–\nProgressive hiring policies, including a diverse candidate pipeline initiative to ensure a more diverse interview slate at the Vice President level and above; and\n–\nSeven global affinity groups that welcome, nurture and provide safe spaces in which our employees can share their unique interests and aspirations.\nOur 2020 engagement survey revealed that all genders are equally engaged, and that D&I gained the second-highest score improvement across categories.\n•\nRewarding and Recognizing High Performance:\nWe aim to create a work environment where every person is inspired to achieve, driven to perform and rewarded for their contributions. We leverage regular, performance-based promotions and merit increases as one lever to engage high-performing talent. During the 2020 cycle, in line with our high performance culture, we were proud to promote employees across all levels and provide merit increases to a significant number of our employees.\nWe regularly monitor employee retention levels and continue to enhance our pay-for-performance approach to improve attrition rates. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, annualized attrition, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 19.0%. Attrition for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 20.6% and 21.7%, respectively. Voluntary attrition normally constitutes the significant majority of our attrition. In 2020, we saw elevated levels of involuntary attrition due to our Fit for Growth Plan, including the exit from certain content-related services. We also saw a decrease in voluntary attrition from historic levels in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both voluntary and involuntary attrition are weighted towards our more junior employees.\n•\nBuilding New Skills:\nClients count on us to know their industries, businesses, and technology environments, readily gain new digital skills and insights, and apply our knowledge to help them increase their competitiveness. We continually reskill and upskill our employees with a focus on building digital skills in areas such as IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud.\nFrom campus hire training for our entry-level workforce to providing capability assurance programs for professional practitioners, we offer a learning ecosystem for employees at all levels. This includes learning and development, access-from-anywhere learning platforms and a variety of content curation partnerships. Our talent development approach has been recognized by leading learning and development organizations, such as the Association for Talent Development, the Brandon Hall Group and the Learning and Performance Institute.\n•\nLeadership Development & Talent Management:\nCognizant continuously fosters and builds its pipeline of diverse, high-performing leaders who have the breadth and versatility to drive our growth. To do this, we focus on engaging all levels of senior talent and enabling their success through continuous assessment and high impact development opportunities.\n5\nHighlights include:\n–\nTargeted talent programs for key pools that include various training opportunities, digital leadership programs and custom leadership development initiatives;\n–\nFast-tracking high-performing and high-potential leadership talent through personalized assessments, executive coaching and executive education programs;\n–\nAccelerating a diverse leadership pipeline through programs like Propel, an initiative focused on priming the next level of women leaders within Cognizant. In just two years, this program has helped us reach 500 women leaders globally through a cohort model supported by executive sponsors, part of our pledge to put 1,000 women through our leadership development program;\n–\nOur LEAD@Cognizant partnership with Harvard University is a 4.5-month leadership capability program designed exclusively for Cognizant leaders to learn, practice and internalize how to set the course, connect the dots, inspire followership and deliver results through strategic alignment, collaboration and building high performing teams; and\n–\nPeriodic talent processes such as talent reviews of our top 4,000 employees at Director level and above, aimed at helping individuals develop in role and prepare for the future, while strengthening our leadership pipeline overall.\n•\nSupporting Well-Being at Work and Home:\nWe offer benefits to care for the diverse needs of our associates and keep them feeling resilient, innovative and engaged. These include total compensation programs, health benefits, overall well-being and family care, tax savings programs, income protection and financial planning resources. As we continue to face evolving environmental and health challenges, we continually review and enhance our offerings to improve the competitiveness of our total compensation programs, including our health benefit offerings.\nHighlights include:\n–\nIn 2020, we launched WorkFlex, a program to provide employees greater flexibility to complete their required hours outside their standard schedule or to transition to a part-time schedule to accommodate personal priorities;\n–\nWe offer a variety of benefits to support employee mental health, including a robust Employee Assistance Program. In the United States, we also provide access to third party mental health platforms, including Ginger and eMindful; and\n–\nCognizant has crisis management protocols that are mobilized to protect employee health and safety when necessary. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, our crisis team responded quickly to close and modify offices to meet health and safety protocols, support the transition to working from home, and liaise with employees regarding various concerns.\n•\nMeasuring and Enhancing Engagement:\nWe regularly assess employee sentiment through third-party engagement surveys. In 2020, 72% of our people participated in the survey. After each survey, we develop and communicate clear action plans to continue to build on our strengths and address shortfalls.\nGovernmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\nAs a result of the size, breadth and geographic diversity of our business, our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including with respect to import and export controls, temporary work authorizations or work permits and other immigration laws, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, anti-corruption, the environment, government affairs, internal and disclosure control obligations, data privacy, intellectual property, employee and labor relations.

    "text": "We face various important risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and, as a result, cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock\n.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and in particular in the markets in which our clients and operations are concentrated.\nGlobal macroeconomic conditions have a significant effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions could cause our clients to reduce, postpone or cancel spending on projects with us and could make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast client demand and have available the right resources to profitably address such client demand. Clients may reduce demand for services quickly and with little warning, which may cause us to incur extra costs where we have employed more personnel than client demand supports.\nOur business is particularly susceptible to economic and political conditions in the markets where our clients or operations are concentrated. Our revenues are highly dependent on clients located in the United States and Europe, and any adverse economic, political or legal uncertainties or adverse developments, including due to the uncertainty related to the potential economic and regulatory impacts of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, may cause clients in these geographies to reduce their spending and materially adversely impact our business. Many of our clients are in the financial services and healthcare industries, so any decrease in growth or significant consolidation in these industries or regulatory policies that restrict these industries may reduce demand for our services. Economic and political developments in India, where a significant majority of our operations and technical personnel are located, or in other countries where we maintain delivery operations, may also have a significant impact on our business and costs of operations. As a developing country, India has experienced and may continue to experience high inflation and wage growth, fluctuations in gross domestic product growth and volatility in currency exchange rates, any of which could materially adversely affect our cost of operations. Additionally, we benefit from governmental policies in India that encourage foreign investment and promote the ease of doing business, such as tax incentives, and any change in policy or circumstances that results in the elimination of such benefits or degradation of the rule of law, or imposition of new adverse restrictions or costs on our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant and continuing adverse impact upon, and this or other pandemics may have a material adverse impact upon, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant loss of life and interruption to the global economy and has resulted in the curtailment of activities by businesses and consumers in much of the world as governments and others seek to limit the spread of the disease, including through business and transportation shutdowns and restrictions on people’s movement and congregation. Among other things, many of our and our clients’ offices have been closed and employees have been working from home and many consumer-facing businesses have closed or are operating at a significantly reduced level to observe various social distancing requirements and government-mandated closures. The overall result has been a dramatic reduction in activity in the global economy, a reduction in demand for many products and services and significant adverse impacts to the financial markets, including the trading price of our common stock in the past and potentially in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant and continuing adverse impact upon, and this or other pandemics may have a material adverse impact upon, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, including as a result of the following:\n•\nReduced client demand for services\n– The vast majority of our business is with clients in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe, all regions that have been hard hit by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced, and other future pandemics could reduce, demand for our services, particularly in regions that have been hit hard by the pandemic and from clients in the retail, consumer goods, travel and hospitality, and communications and media industries, and is likely to continue to result in reduced demand for our services as clients across many industries face reduced demand for their products and services. Among other things, some of our clients have postponed, cancelled or scaled-back existing projects and not entered into or reduced the scope of potential projects, and may continue to do so.\n•\nClient pricing pressure, payment term extensions and insolvency risk\n– As clients face reduced demand for their products and services, reduce their business activity and face increased financial pressure on their businesses, we have faced and may continue to face downward pressure on our pricing and gross margins due to pricing\n9\nconcessions to clients and requests from clients to extend payment terms. In addition, some of our clients have requested and may continue to request extended payment terms, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flows from operations. We may also face a significantly elevated risk of client insolvency, bankruptcy or liquidity challenges where we may perform services and incur expenses for which we are not paid.\n•\nDelivery challenges\n– Due to the closures of many of our and our clients’ facilities, including as a result of various orders from national, state or local governments, we have faced and may continue to face, in the near term or in future pandemics, challenges in delivering services to our clients and satisfying contractually agreed upon service levels. The pandemic, particularly in India, but also in the Philippines and other countries where we have near-shore or offshore delivery operations for clients, as well as our in-country offices and offices of clients where our associates may normally work, has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to deliver services to clients. Our work-from-home arrangements for many of our employees may increase our exposure to security breaches or cyberattacks. The ransomware attack we were subject to in April 2020 compounded the challenges we faced in enabling work-from-home arrangements and resulted in setbacks and delays to such efforts. A significant worsening of the pandemic, particularly in India, or another security incident during the pandemic, could materially impair our ability to deliver services to clients to an extent that may have a material adverse impact to our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\n•\nIncreased costs\n– We face increased costs from the pandemic, including as a result of mitigation efforts such as enabling increased work-from-home capabilities and additional health and safety measures.\n•\nDiversion of and strain on management and other corporate resources\n– Addressing the significant personal and business challenges presented by the pandemic, including various business continuity measures and the need to enable work-from-home arrangements for many of our associates, has demanded significant management time and attention and strained other corporate resources, and is expected to continue to do so. Among other things, this may adversely impact our client and associate development and our ability to execute our strategy and various transformation initiatives.\n•\nReduced employee morale and productivity\n– The significant personal and business challenges presented by a pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the potentially life-threatening health risks to employees and their families and friends, the closures of schools and the unavailability of various services our employees may rely upon, such as childcare, have been and may be a cause of employee morale concerns and may adversely impact employee productivity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The ultimate extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the delivery and effectiveness of vaccines, future mutations of the COVID-19 virus and any resulting impact on the effectiveness of vaccines, the duration and extent of the pandemic and waves of infection, travel restrictions and social distancing, the duration and extent of business closures and business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain, treat and prevent the disease. If we or our clients experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected, and our ability to access the capital markets may be limited.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain skilled employees to satisfy client demand, including highly skilled technical personnel and personnel with experience in key digital areas, as well as senior management to lead our business globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, including project managers, IT engineers and senior technical personnel, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with client demand around the world and on our ability to attract and retain senior management with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. Each year, we must hire tens of thousands of new employees and reskill, retain, and motivate our workforce of hundreds of thousands of employees with diverse skills and expertise in order to serve client demands across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technological, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business. We also must continue to maintain an effective senior leadership team that, among other things, is effective in executing on our strategic goals and growing our digital business. The loss of senior executives, or the failure to attract, integrate and retain new senior executives as the needs of our business require, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCompetition for skilled labor is intense and, in some jurisdictions and service areas in which we operate and, in particular, in key digital areas, there are more open positions than qualified persons to fill these positions. Our business has experienced and may continue to experience significant employee attrition, which may cause us to incur increased costs to hire new employees with the desired skills. Costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant. If we are unable to hire or deploy employees with the needed skillsets or if we are unable to adequately equip our employees with the skills needed,\n10\nthis could materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, if we are unable to maintain an employee environment that is competitive and appealing, it could have an adverse effect on engagement and retention, which may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe face challenges related to growing our business organically as well as inorganically through acquisitions, and we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates.\nAchievement of our targeted growth rates requires continued significant organic growth of our business as well as inorganic growth through acquisitions. To achieve such growth, we must, among other things, continue to significantly expand our global operations, increase our product and service offerings, in particular with respect to digital, and scale our infrastructure to support such business growth. Continued business growth increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, employees, operations, systems, delivery, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, which we will have to continue to develop and improve to sustain such growth. We must continually recruit and train new employees, retain and reskill, as necessary, existing sales, technical, finance, marketing and management employees with the knowledge, skills and experience that our business model requires and effectively manage our employees worldwide to support our culture, values, strategies and goals. Additionally, we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and investments to enhance our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries. We may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities, completing targeted transactions or achieving the desired results, and such opportunities may divert our management's time and focus away from our core business. We may face challenges in effectively integrating acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and in assimilating and retaining employees of those businesses into our culture and organizational structure. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, complete acquisitions of the number, magnitude and nature we have targeted, or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our targeted growth rates or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position generally or in specific markets or services.\nWe may not be able to achieve our profitability goals and maintain our capital return strategy.\nOur goals for profitability and capital return rely upon a number of assumptions, including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations and make successful investments to grow and further develop our business. Our profitability depends on the efficiency with which we run our operations and the cost of our operations, especially the compensation and benefits costs of our employees. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs related to implementing our strategy to optimize such costs, and we may not realize the ultimate cost savings that we expect. We may not be able to efficiently utilize our employees if increased regulation, policy changes or administrative burdens of immigration, work visas or client worksite placement prevents us from deploying our employees on a timely basis, or at all, to fulfill the needs of our clients. Increases in wages and other costs may put pressure on our profitability. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can also have adverse effects on our revenues, income from operations and net income when items denominated in other currencies are translated or remeasured into U.S. dollars for presentation of our consolidated financial statements. We have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to partially offset the impact of the movement of the exchange rates on future operating costs and to mitigate foreign currency risk on foreign currency denominated net monetary assets. However, the hedging strategies that we have implemented, or may in the future implement, to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risks may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and may expose our business to unexpected market, operational and counterparty credit risks. We are particularly susceptible to wage and cost pressures in India and the exchange rate of the Indian rupee relative to the currencies of our client contracts due to the fact that the substantial majority of our employees are in India while our contracts with clients are typically in the local currency of the country where our clients are located. If we are unable to improve the efficiency of our operations, our operating margin may decline and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Failure to achieve our profitability goals could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to capital return, our ability and decisions to pay dividends and repurchase shares depend on a variety of factors, including the cash flow generated from operations, our cash and investment balances, our net income, our overall liquidity position, potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, and anticipated future economic conditions and financial results. Failure to maintain our capital return strategy may adversely impact our reputation with shareholders and shareholders’ perception of our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur failure to meet specified service levels or milestones required by certain of our client contracts may result in our client contracts being less profitable, potential liability for penalties or damages or reputational harm.\nMany of our client contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. Failure to satisfy these requirements could significantly reduce our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments, subject us to potential damage claims\n11\nunder the contract terms or harm our reputation. The use of new technologies in our offerings can expose us to additional risks if those technologies fail to work as predicted, which could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. Clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments. Some of our contracts provide that a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients’ actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate. As such, these provisions may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts and have in the past, and could in the future, result in significant losses on such contracts.\nWe face intense and evolving competition and significant technological advances that our service offerings must keep pace with in the rapidly changing markets we compete in.\nThe markets we serve and operate in are highly competitive, subject to rapid change and characterized by a large number of participants, as described in “\n-Competition.” In addition to large, global competitors, we face competition in many geographic markets from numerous smaller, local competitors that may have more experience with operations in these markets, have well-established relationships with our desired clients, or be able to provide services and solutions at lower costs or on terms more attractive to clients than we can. Consolidation activity may also result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or vertical integration that makes them more attractive to clients as a single provider of integrated products and services. In addition, concurrent use by many clients of multiple professional service providers means that we are required to be continually competitive on the quality, scope and pricing of our offerings or face a reduction or elimination of our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as AI, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, IoT, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies, successfully adapt to industry developments and changing demand, and evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve, we may be unable to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and execute on our growth strategy, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur relationships with our third party alliance partners, who supply us with necessary components to the services and solutions we offer our clients, are also critical to our ability to provide many of our services and solutions that address client demands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such relationships. Among other things, such alliance partners may in the future decide to compete with us, form exclusive or more favorable arrangements with our competitors or otherwise reduce our access to their products impairing our ability to provide the services and solutions demanded by clients.\nWe face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Cognizant data from security breaches and/or cyberattacks.\nIn order to provide our services and solutions, we depend on global information technology networks and systems, to process, transmit, host and securely store electronic information (including our confidential information and the confidential information of our clients) and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, suppliers and partners. Security breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error create risks of shutdowns or disruptions of our operations and potential unauthorized access and/or disclosure of our or our clients’ sensitive data, which in turn could jeopardize projects that are critical to our operations or the operations of our clients’ businesses and have other adverse impacts on our business or the business of our clients.\nLike other global companies, we and the clients and vendors we interact with face threats to data and systems, including by nation state threat actors, perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate client information and cause system failures and disruptions. For example, in April 2020, we announced a security incident involving a Maze ransomware attack. The attack resulted in unauthorized access to certain data and caused significant disruption to our business.\nA security compromise of our information systems, or of those of businesses with which we interact, that results in confidential information being accessed by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, client attrition due to reputational concerns or otherwise, containment and remediation expenses, and claims brought by our clients or others for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or data protection laws. Monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and may impose costs in excess of insurance policy limits or not be covered by our insurance at all. Techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or\n12\nsabotage systems continuously evolve and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems, diverting resources from other projects and disrupting our businesses. Any remediation measures that we have taken or that we may undertake in the future in response to the security incident announced in April 2020 or other security threats may be insufficient to prevent future attacks.\nWe are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data security and privacy regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and in other jurisdictions in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation has imposed stringent compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has resulted in the issuance of significant financial penalties for noncompliance. In the United States, there have been proposals for federal privacy legislation and many new state privacy laws are on the horizon. Recently enacted legislation, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, and its successor the California Privacy Rights Act that will go into effect on January 1, 2023, impose extensive privacy requirements on organizations governing personal information. Existing U.S. sectoral laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act also impose extensive privacy and security requirements on organizations operating in the healthcare industry, which we serve. Additionally, in India, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 continues to make progress through the Indian Parliament. If enacted in its current form it would impose stringent obligations on the handling of personal data, including certain localization requirements for sensitive data. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies or our clients pursuant to our contractual obligations relating to our compliance with these regulations. Complying with changing regulatory requirements requires us to incur substantial costs, exposes us to potential regulatory action or litigation, and may require changes to our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results.\nIf our risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery plans are not effective and our global delivery capabilities are impacted, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and we may suffer harm to our reputation.\nOur business model is dependent on our global delivery capabilities, which include coordination between our delivery centers in India, our other global and regional delivery centers, the offices of our clients and our associates worldwide. System failures, outages and operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as hostilities, political unrest, terrorist attacks, natural disasters (including events that may be caused or exacerbated by climate change), and public health emergencies and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the geographies where our people, equipment and clients are located. For example, we have substantial global delivery operations in Chennai, India, a city that has experienced severe rains, flooding and droughts in recent years and is at significant risk of increasingly severe natural disasters in future years as a result of climate change. Our risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective at preventing or mitigating the effects of such disruptions, particularly in the case of catastrophic events or longer term developments, such as the impacts of climate change. Any such disruption may result in lost revenues, a loss of clients and reputational damage, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our employees in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and other jurisdictions rely on visas to work in those areas such that any restrictions on such visas or immigration more generally or increased costs of obtaining such visas or increases in the wages we are required to pay associates on visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in these jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our employees in the United States and in many other jurisdictions, including countries in Europe, rely upon temporary work authorization or work permits, which makes our business particularly vulnerable to changes and variations in immigration laws and regulations, including written changes and policy changes to the manner in which the laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, and potential enforcement actions and penalties that might cause us to lose access to such visas. The political environment in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries in recent years has included significant support for anti-immigrant legislation and administrative changes. Many of these recent changes have resulted in, and various proposed changes may result in, increased difficulty in obtaining timely visas that could impact our ability to staff projects, including as a result of visa application rejections and delays in processing applications, and significantly increased costs for us in obtaining visas or as a result of prevailing wage requirements for our associates on visas. For example, in the United States, the prior administration adopted a number of policy changes and executive orders designed to limit immigration and the ability of immigrants to be employed, including increased scrutiny of the issuance of new and the renewal of existing H-1B visa applications and the placement of H-1B visa workers on third party worksites, i\nncreases to the prevailing wage requirements that set a minimum level of compensation for visa holders and, for entities where more than 50% of the workers in the United States hold H-1B and L-1 visas, increases in the visa costs for such entities. While a number of\n13\nthese policy changes and executive orders were stayed by the courts, the current administration may continue to seek their implementation or the implementation of similar measures in the future and there continues to be political support for potential new laws and regulations that, if adopted, may have a material adverse impact on companies like ours that have a substantial percentage of our employees on visas. Our principal operating subsidiary in the United States had more than 50% of its employees on H-1B or L-1 visas as of December 31, 2020 and, as a result, may be subject to increased costs if any such laws, regulations, policy changes or executive orders go into effect.\nIn the EU, many countries continue to implement new regulations to move into compliance with the EU Directive of 2014 to harmonize immigration rules for intracompany transferees in most EU member states and to facilitate the transfer of managers, specialists and graduate trainees both into and within the region. The changes have had significant impact on mobility programs and have led to new notification and documentation requirements for companies sending employees to EU countries. Recent changes or any additional adverse revisions to immigration laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may cause us delays, staffing shortages, additional costs or an inability to bid for or fulfill projects for clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal, Regulatory and Legislative Risks\nAnti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing could impair our ability to serve our clients and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe practice of outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in the United States, which is our largest market, as well as other regions in which we have clients. For example, measures aimed at limiting or restricting outsourcing by U.S. companies have been put forward for consideration by the U.S. Congress and in state legislatures to address concerns over the perceived association between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically. If any such measure is enacted, our ability to provide services to our clients could be impaired.\nIn addition, from time to time there has been publicity about purported negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing, such as alleged domestic job loss and theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data, particularly involving service providers in India. Current or prospective clients may elect to perform certain services themselves or may be discouraged from utilizing global service delivery providers like us due to negative perceptions that may be associated with using global service delivery models or firms. Any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate.\nWe are subject to numerous and evolving legal and regulatory requirements and client expectations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate, and violations of, unfavorable changes in or an inability to meet such requirements or expectations could harm our business.\nWe provide services to clients and have operations in many parts of the world and in a wide variety of different industries, subjecting us to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations on matters as diverse as import and export controls, temporary work authorizations or work permits and other immigration laws, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, anti-corruption laws (including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act), the environment, government affairs, internal and disclosure control obligations, data privacy, intellectual property, employment and labor relations. We face significant regulatory compliance costs and risks as a result of the size and breadth of our business. For example, we may experience\nincreased costs in 2021 and future years for employment and post-employment benefits in India as a result of the issuance of the\nCode\nin late 2020.\nWe are also subject to a wide range of potential enforcement actions, audits or investigations regarding our compliance with these laws or regulations in the conduct of our business, and any finding of a violation could subject us to a wide range of civil or criminal penalties, including fines, debarment, or suspension or disqualification from government contracting, prohibitions or restrictions on doing business, loss of clients and business, legal claims by clients and damage to our reputation.\nWe commit significant financial and managerial resources to comply with our internal control over financial reporting requirements, but we have in the past and may in the future identify material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that cause us to incur incremental remediation costs in order to maintain adequate controls. As another example, in recent years we had to spend significant resources on conducting an internal investigation and cooperating with investigations by the DOJ and the SEC, both concluded in 2019, focused on whether certain payments relating to Company-owned facilities in India were made in violation of the FCPA and other applicable laws.\nGovernmental bodies, investors, clients and businesses are increasingly focused on ESG issues, which has resulted and may in the future continue to result in the adoption of new laws and regulations and changing buying practices. If we fail to\n14\nkeep pace with ESG trends and developments or fail to meet the expectations of our clients and investors, our reputation and business could be adversely impacted.\nChanges in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, failure by us to adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to achieve global tax efficiencies or adverse outcomes of tax audits, investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe interpretation of tax laws and regulations in the many jurisdictions in which we operate and the related tax accounting principles are complex and require considerable judgment to determine our income taxes and other tax liabilities worldwide. Tax laws and regulations affecting us and our clients, including applicable tax rates, and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations are subject to change as a result of economic, political and other factors, and any such changes or changes in tax accounting principles could increase our effective worldwide income tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our net income and financial condition. We routinely review and update our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including transfer pricing policies, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, to align with our evolving business operations and provide global tax efficiencies across the numerous jurisdictions, such as the United States, India and the United Kingdom, in which we operate. Failure to successfully adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to align with our evolving business operations and achieve global tax efficiencies may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition.\nThe following are several examples of changes in tax laws that may impact us:\n•\nThe Tax Reform Act was enacted in December 2017 and made a number of significant changes to the corporate tax regime in the United States. The U.S. Treasury department continues to issue proposed and final regulations which modify relevant aspects of the new tax regime.\n•\nIn December 2019, the Government of India enacted the India Tax Law effective retroactively to April 1, 2019 that enables Indian companies to elect to be taxed at a lower income tax rate of 25.17% as compared to the current rate of 34.94%. Once a company elects into the lower income tax rate, that company may not benefit from any tax holidays associated with SEZs and certain other tax incentives, including MAT carryforwards, and may not reverse its election. As of December 31, 2020, we had deferred income tax assets related to the MAT carryforwards of $98 million. See\nto our consolidated financial statements. Our current intent is to elect into the new tax regime once our MAT carryforwards are fully or substantially utilized. Our intent is based on a number of current assumptions and financial projections, and if our intent were to change and we were to opt into the new tax regime at an earlier time, the write-off of any remaining MAT deferred tax assets may materially increase our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate and decrease our EPS, while the loss of the benefit of the MAT carryforwards may increase our cash tax payments.\n•\nThe OECD has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change numerous long-standing tax principles. The changes recommended by the OECD have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business and could lead to disagreements among jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits among them. The OECD has also undertaken a new project focused on “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy.” This project may impact multinational businesses by implementing a global model for minimum taxation. Similarly, the European Commission and various jurisdictions have introduced proposals to or passed laws that impose a separate tax on specified digital services. These recent and potential future tax law changes create uncertainty and may materially adversely impact our provision for income taxes.\nOur worldwide effective income tax rate may increase as a result of these recent developments, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued and ongoing and future actions the Company has or may take with respect to our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements.\nAdditionally, we are subject from time to time to tax audits, investigations and proceedings. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. For example, we are currently involved in an ongoing dispute with the ITD in which the ITD asserts that we owe additional taxes for two transactions by which CTS India repurchased shares from its shareholders, as more fully described in\nto the consolidated financial statements. Adverse outcomes in any such audits, investigations or proceedings could increase our tax exposure and cause us to incur increased expense, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n15\nOur business subjects us to considerable potential exposure to litigation and legal claims and could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\nWe are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the conduct of our business. Our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable.\nOur client engagements expose us to significant potential legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise breach obligations to third parties or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. For example, third parties could claim that we or our clients, whom we typically contractually agree to indemnify with respect to the services and solutions we provide, infringe upon their IP rights. Any such claims of IP infringement could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs in defending ourselves, expose us to considerable legal liability or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. We may have to engage in legal action to protect our own IP rights, and enforcing our rights may require considerable time, money and oversight, and existing laws in the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection.\nWe also face considerable potential legal liability from a variety of other sources. Our acquisition activities have in the past and may in the future be subject to litigation or other claims, including claims from employees, clients, stockholders, or other third parties. We have also been the subject of a number of putative securities class action complaints and putative shareholder derivative complaints relating to the matters that were the subject of our now concluded internal investigation into potential violations of the FCPA and other applicable laws, and may be subject to such legal actions for these or other matters in the future. See \"\n\" for more information. We establish reserves for these and other matters when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated; however, the estimation of legal reserves and possible losses involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation, and the actual losses arising from particular matters may exceed our estimates and materially adversely affect our results of operations."

As of December 31, 2020, the approximate number of holders of record of our Class A common stock was\n114\nand the approximate number of beneficial holders of our Class A common stock was\n342,100\n.\nCash Dividends\nDuring 2020, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share, or $0.88 per share in total for the year. In February 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $0.02 increase to our quarterly cash dividends and the Company's declaration of a $0.24 per share dividend with a record date of February 18, 2021 and a payment date of February 26, 2021. We intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in accordance with our capital return plan. Our ability and decisions to pay future dividends depend on a variety of factors, including our cash flow generated from operations, cash and investment balances, net income, overall liquidity position, potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, and anticipated future economic conditions and financial results.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur stock repurchase program, as amended by our Board of Directors in December 2020, allows for the repurchase of up to $9.5 billion, excluding fees and expenses, of our Class A common stock through open market purchases, including under a 10b5-1 Plan or in private transactions, including through ASR agreements entered into with financial institutions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares to be purchased are determined by management, in its discretion, or pur\nsuant to 10b5-1 Plan\n, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $721 million of our Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program. The following table sets out the stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program as of December 31, 2020.\nWe regularly purchase shares in connection with our stock-based compensation plans as shares of our Class A common stock are tendered by employees for payment of applicable statutory tax withholdings. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we purchased 0.2 shares at an aggregate cost of $18 million in connection with employee tax withholding obligations.\n17\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Class A common stock with the cumulative total return on the S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq-100 Index, S&P 500 Information Technology Index and a Peer Group Index (capitalization weighted) for the period beginning December 31, 2015 and ending on the last day of our last completed fiscal year.

    "text": "Cognizant is one of the world’s leading professional services companies, engineering modern business for the digital era. Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Digital services have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. We are focused on continued investment in four key areas of digital: IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is continuing to cause significant loss of life and interruption to the global economy, including the curtailment of activities by businesses and consumers in much of the world as governments and others seek to limit the spread of the disease. In response to COVID-19, we have prioritized the safety and well-being of our employees, business continuity for our clients, and supporting the efforts of governments around the world\nto contain the spread of the virus. In light of our commitment to help our clients as they navigate unprecedented business challenges while protecting the safety of our employees, we have taken numerous step\ns, and may continue to take further actions, t\no address the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been working closely with our clients to support them as they implemented their contingency plans, helping them access our services and solutions remotely. We also undertook a significant effort to enable our employees to work from home by providing them with computer and Internet accessibility equipment while seeking to maintain appropriate security protocols. Despite these efforts, in the first half of 2020 we experienced some delays in project fulfillment as delivery, particularly in India and the Philippines, shifted to work-from-home in response to the pandemic. Additionally, as a result of the ongoing pandemic, we experienced reduced client de\nmand, pro\nject deferrals, furloughs, and temporary rate concessions, which adversely affected revenues across all of our business segments in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $65 million of costs in respo\nnse to the COVID-19 pandemic, including certain costs incurred to enable our employees to work remotely.\nIn 2020, we incurred costs related to the execution of our multi-year 2020 Fit for Growth Plan aimed at accelerating revenue\ngrowth. This plan refined our strategic focus and launched a series of measures to improve our operational and commercial models and optimize our cost structure in order to partially fund investments in key digital areas of IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud and advance our growth agenda. The 2020 Fit for Growth Plan included our decision to exit certain content-related services that are not in line with our strategic vision for the Company. The optimization measures that were part of the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan resulted in total charges of $221 million, primarily related to severance and facility exit costs that are expected to generate an annualized savings run rate, before anticipated investments, of approximate\nly $530 million in 2021. See\nto\nour consolidated financial statements for additional information on these costs, which are reported in the caption \"Restructuring charges\" in our consolidated statements of operations. We do not expect to incur additional costs related to this plan. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our ability to realize the benefits of our strategy and various transformation initiatives, including the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan. See\n.\nOur exit from certain content-related services negatively impacted our 2020 revenues by approximately $178 million within our Communications, Media and Technology segment in North America.\nOn April 20, 2020, we announced a security incident involving a Maze ransomware attack. As previously reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2020\n, based on numerous remediation steps that have been undertaken and our continued monitoring of our environment, we believe we have contained the attack and eradicated remnants of the attacker activity from our environment. The lost revenue and containment, investigation, remediation, legal and other costs incurred due to the ransomware attack may exceed our insurance policy limits or may not be covered by insurance at all. Other actual and potential consequences include, but are not limited to, negative publicity, reputational damage, lost trust with customers, regulatory enforcement action, litigation that could result in financial judgments or the payment of settlement amounts and disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage.\nIn March 2020, the Indian parliament enacted the Budget of India, which contained a number of provisions related to income tax, including a replacement of the DDT, previously due from the dividend payer, with a tax payable by the shareholder receiving the dividend. This provision reduced the tax rate applicable to us for cash repatriated from India. Following this change, during the first quarter of 2020, we limited our indefinite reinvestment assertion to India earnings accumulated in prior\n19\nyears. In July 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released final regulations, which became effective in September 2020, that reduced the tax applicable on our accumulated Indian earnings upon repatriation. As a result, during the third quarter of 2020, after a thorough analysis of the impact of these changes in law on the cost of earnings repatriation and considering our strategic decision\nto increase our investments to accelerate growth in various international markets and expand our global delivery footprint, we reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on Indian earnings accumulated in prior years and recorded a $140 million Tax on Accumulated Indian Earnings. The recorded income tax expense reflects the India withholding tax on unrepatriated Indian earnings, which were $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, net of applicable U.S. foreign tax credits. On October 28, 2020, our subsidiary in India remitted a dividend of $2.1 billion, which resulted in a net payment of $2.0 billion to its shareholders (non-Indian Cognizant entities), after payment of $106 million of India withholding tax.\nOn October 27, 2020, a jury returned a verdict in our favor in the amount of $854 million, including $570 million punitive damages, in our lawsuit with Syntel, which was initiated in 2015. We expect Syntel to appeal the decision and thus we will not record the gain in our financial statements until it becomes realizable. For more information, see\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we made an offer to settle and exit a large customer engagement in Financial Services in Continental Europe (\"Proposed Exit\"). The offer includes, among other terms, a proposed payment and the forgiveness of certain receivables. The 2020 impact of the Proposed Exit was a reduction of\nrevenues of $118 million and additional expenses of $33 million, primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets. The Proposed Exit negatively impacted each of our GAAP and Adjusted Diluted EPS by $0.27 for the year ended December 31, 2020. While the amounts recorded are based on our best estimate of the expected terms of the exit, the negotiations are ongoing and, as such, we may not reach an agreement or the final terms of the agreement that is reached may materially differ from those contemplated in our accounting. In either instance, there could be additional impacts to our statement of operations, financial condition and our cash flows.\n2020 Financial Results\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nOur financial results were negatively impacted by our exit from certain content-related services, the Proposed Exit, the ransomware attack and the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to experience pricing pressure within our core portfolio of services as our clients optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations. At the same time, clients are adopting and integrating digital technologies and their demand for our digital services and solutions has continued to increase since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of increased demand for mobile workplace solutions, e-commerce, automation and AI and cybersecurity services and solutions.\n1\nAdjusted Income From Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n20\nThe following charts set forth revenues and change in revenues by business segment and geography for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019:\nAcross all our business segments and regions, revenues\nwere negatively impacted by the COVID-\n19 pandemic and the ransomware attack. Retail, consumer goods, travel and hospitality clients within our Products and Resources segment as well as communications and media clients in our Communications, Media and Technology segment were particularly adversely affected by the pandemic.\nRevenues in our Financial Services segment in our Continental Europe region were negatively impacted by $118 million due to the Proposed Exit. Additionally, we continued to see certain financial services and healthcare clients transition the support of some of their legacy systems and operations in-house. Revenue growth among our life sciences clients was driven by revenues from Zenith and increased demand for our services among pharmaceutical companies while revenues from our healthcare clients benefited from stronger software license sales.\nO\nur manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities clients within our Products and Resources segment generated revenue growth due to our clients' continued adoption and integration of digital technologies.\nRevenues among our technology clients in our Communicatio\nns, Media and Technology segment in the North America region were negatively impacted by approximately $178 million due to our exit from certain content-related services. We continue to see growing demand from our technology\nclients for other more strategic digital content services. Additionally, the year-over-year change in our revenues included 210 basis points of benefit from our recently completed acquisitions, including Co\nllaborative Solutions, Zenith and Contino.\nOur operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\n2\ndecreased to 12.7% and 14.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 14.6% and 16.6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margin\n2\nwere adversely impacted by higher incentive-based compensation accrual rates, investments intended to drive organic and inorganic revenue growth, the impact of the Proposed Exit, the decline in revenues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the ransomware attack on both revenues and costs. These impacts were partially offset by a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost savings generated as a result of the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, lower immigration costs and the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. In addition, our 2019 GAAP operating margin included a 0.7% negative impact of the incremental accrual in 2019 related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation as discussed in\nto our consolidated financial statements, while our 2020 GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by COVID-19 Charges.\n2\nConstant currency revenue growth (CC) and Adjusted Operating Margin are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, as applicable.\n21\nBusiness Outlook\nWe have four strategic priorities as we seek to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth. These strategic priorities are:\n•\nAccelerating digital - growing our digital business organically and inorganically;\n•\nGlobalizing Cognizant - growing our business in key international markets and diversifying leadership, capabilities and delivery footprint;\n•\nRepositioning our brand - improving our global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire C-suite; and\n•\nIncreasing our relevance to our clients - leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients' business needs.\nWe continue to expect the long-term focus of our clients to be on their digital transformation into software-driven, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. As our clients seek to optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations, our core portfolio of services may be subject to pricing pressure and lower demand due to clients transitioning certain work in-house. At the same time, clients continue to adopt and integrate digital technologies and their demand for our digital operations services and solutions has only increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as demand for mobile workplace solutions, e-commerce, automation and AI and cybersecurity services and solutions has grown.\nOur clients will likely continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policies and other macroeconomic factors, which could affect their demand for our services. The COVID-19 pandemic ma\ny continue to negatively impact demand, particularly among our retail, consumer goods, travel and hospitality clients within our Products and Resources segment as well as communications and media clients in our Communications, Media and Technology segment.\nThe significant and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to estimate its future impact on our ongoing business, results of operations and overall financial performance.\nSee\n.\nAs a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. Competition for skilled labor is intense and our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, in particular those with experience in key digital areas, in balance with client demand around the world. As such, we will continue to focus on recruiting, talent management and employee engagement to attract and retain our employees.\nWe will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances that will expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries.\nIn addition, our future results may be affected by immigration law changes that may impact our ability to do business or significantly increase our costs of doing\nbusi\nness, potential tax law changes and other potential regulatory changes, including potentially increased costs in 2021 and future years for employment and post-employment benefits in India as a result of the issuance of the Code in late 20\n20, as well as costs related to the potential resolution of legal a\nnd regulatory matters discussed in\nto our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, see\n22\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, including a year-to-year comparison between 2019 and 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to The Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data for the years ended December 31:\n(1)    Exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\nRevenues - Overall\nDuring 2020, revenues decreased by $131 million as compared to 2019, representing a decline of 0.8%, or 0.7% on a constant currency basis\n3\n. Across all business segments and regions, revenues were negatively impacted by the ransomware attack and the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our exit from certain content-related services and the Proposed Exit negatively impacted our revenues by $178 million and $118 million, respectively. We continue to experience pricing pressure within our core portfolio of services as our clients optimize the cost of supporting their legacy systems and operations. At the same time, clients are adopting and integrating digital technologies and their demand for our digital services and solutions has continued to increase since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of increased demand for mobile workplace solutions, e-commerce, automation and AI and cybersecurity services and solutions.\nAdditionally, the year-over-year change in our revenues included 210 basis points of benefit from our recently completed acquisitions, including Co\nllaborative Solutions, Zenith and Contino. Revenues from clients added during 2020, including those related to acquisitions, were $342 million.\n3\nAdjusted Income From Operations, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Diluted EPS and constant currency revenue growth are not measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as applicable.\n23\nRevenues - Reportable Business Segments\nRevenues by reportable business segment were as follows:\nFinancial Services\nRevenues from our Financial Services segment declined 4.2%, or 4.0% on a constant currency basis\n4\n, in 2020. Revenues among our insurance clients decreased by $85 million as compared to a decrease of $163 million from our banking clients. The Proposed Exit negatively impacted our revenues from banking clients by $118 million. Revenues from clients added during 2020, including those related to acquisitions, were $70 million. Moderate revenue growth generated by our digital services did not fully offset revenue declines attributable to certain financial services clients who continued to transition the support of some of their legacy systems and operations in-house.\nHealthcare\nRevenues from our Healthcare segment grew 3.3%, or 3.1% on a constant currency basis\n4\n, in 2020. Revenues in this segment increased by $173 million among our life science clients while revenues from our healthcare clients decreased $16 million. Revenue growth among our life sciences clients was driven by revenues from Zenith and increased demand for our services among pharmaceutical companies. Revenues from our healthcare clients were negatively impacted by the establishment of an offshore captive by a large client, partially offset by the\n2019 negative impact of a customer dispute with a healthcare client related to a large volume based contract\n. Additionally, revenues from our healthcare clients benefited from stronger software license sales in 2020. Revenues from clients added during 2020, including those related to acquisitions, were $50 million. Demand from our healthcare clients may continue to be affected by uncertainty in the regulatory and political environment while demand from our life sciences clients may be affected by industry consolidation.\nProducts and Resources\nRevenues from our Products and Resources segment declined 2.0%, or 1.7% on a constant currency basis\n4\n, in 2020. Retail, consumer goods, travel and hospitality\nclients were particularly adversely affected by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Thus, revenue from our travel and hospitality clients and from our retail and consumer goods clients decreased by $126 million and $100 million, respectively. Revenues from our manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities clients increased by $152 million due to our clients' adoption and integration of digital technologies. Revenues from clients added during 2020, including those related to acquisitions, were $105 million.\nCommunications, Media and Technology\nRevenues from our Communications, Media and Technology segment grew 1.4%, or 1.6% on a constant currency basis\n4\n,\nin 2020. Revenues from our communications and media clients increased $72 million while revenues from our technology clients decreased $38 million. Revenues among our technology clients in this segment were negatively impacted by approximately $178 million due to our exit from certain content-related services. Additionally, revenues were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among our communications and media clients, partially offset by growing demand from our technology clients for\nother more strategic\ndigital content services. Revenues from clients added during 2020, including those related to acquisitions, were $117 million.\n4\nConstant currency revenue growth is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information.\n24\nRevenues - Geographic Locations\nRevenues by geographic market, as determined by client location, were as follows:\nNorth America continues to be our largest market, representing 75.6% of total 2020 revenues. Our North America region was negatively impacted by our exit from certain content-related services in our Communications, Media and Technology segment and the transition of the support of legacy systems for certain financial services and healthcare clients in-house. Our Continental Europe region was negatively impacted by the Proposed Exit, partially offset by growth from our life sciences customers. Revenues in our United Kingdom region have particularly benefited from our recently completed acquisitions. Revenue growth in our Rest of World region was driven by our Communications, Media and Technology clients.\nCost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense)\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, project-related immigration and travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and equipment costs relating to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 0.3% during 2020 as compared to 2019, increasing as a percentage of revenues to 64.1% in 2020 compared to 63.4% in 2019. The increase in cost of revenues, as a percentage of revenues, was due primarily to an increase in costs related to higher incentive-based compensation accrual rates in 2020 and the impact of the Proposed Exit, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ransomware attack. These impacts were partially offset by a significant decrease in travel and entertainment costs as a result of a reduction in travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost savings generated as a result of our cost optimization strategy and the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. d\nollar.\nSG&A Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense)\nSG&A expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. SG&A expenses increased by 4.3% during 2020 as compared to 2019, increasing as a percentage of revenues to 18.6% in 2020 as compared to 17.7% in 2019. The increase, as a percentage of revenues, was due primarily to an increase in costs related to higher incentive-based compensation accrual rates in 2020, investments intended to drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Proposed Exit and the ransomware attack. These negative impacts were partially offset by a significant decrease in travel and entertainment costs as a result of a reduction in travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lower immigration costs, in addition to the $117 million incremental accrual in 2019 related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation as discussed in\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges consist of our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan and our realignment program. Restructuring charges were $215 million, or 1.3% as a percentage of revenues during 2020, as compared to $217 million, or 1.3% as a percentage of revenues, during 2019. For further detail on our restructuring charges see\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by 8.9% during 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase was due to procurement of additional computer equipment primarily to provision work-from-home arrangements and amortization of intangibles from recently completed acquisitions.\n5\nConstant currency revenue growth is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information.\n25\nOperating Margin - Overall\nOur operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin\n6\ndecreased to 12.7% and 14.4%, respectively, in 2020 from 14.6% and 16.6%, respectively, during 2019. Our GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margin\n6\nwere adversely impacted by higher incentive-based compensation accrual rates, investments intended to drive organic and inorganic revenue growth, the impact of the Proposed Exit, the decline in revenues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of the ransomware attack on both revenues and costs. These impacts were partially offset by a significant decrease in travel and entertainment expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cost savings generated as a result of the 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, lower immigration costs and the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. In addition, our 2019 GAAP operating margin included a 0.7% negative impact of the incremental accrual in 2019 related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation as discussed in\nto our consolidated financial statements, while our 2020 GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by COVID-19 Charges.\nExcluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 92 basis points or 0.92 percentage points in 2020,\nwhile in 2019 the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 53 basis points or 0.53 percentage poi\nnts. Each additional 1.0% change in exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 17 basis points or 0.17 percentage points.\nWe enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. The impact of the settlement of our cash flow hedges was immaterial in 2020 and 2019.\nOur most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our employees. These costs are affected by the impact of inflation. In certain regions, competition for professionals with the advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation.\nWe finished the year ended December 31, 2020 with approximately 289,500 employees, which is a decrease of 3,000 as compared to December 31, 2019. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 19.0%. Turnover for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 20.6% and 21.7%. Voluntary attrition normally constitutes the significant majority of our attrition. In 2020, we saw elevated levels of involuntary attrition due to our Fit for Growth Plan, including the exit from certain content-related services. We also saw a decrease in voluntary attrition from historic levels in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both voluntary and involuntary attrition are weighted towards our more junior employees.\nSegment Operating Profit and Margin\nSegment operating profit and margin were as follows:\nAcross all our business segments, operating margins benefited from a significant decrease in travel and entertainment costs due to COVID-19 related reductions in travel, cost savings generated by our cost optimization initiatives and the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by\ninvestments intended to drive organic and inorganic revenue growth\nand the negative impact on revenues of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ransomware attack. The 2020 operating margin in our Financial Services segment was negatively impacted by the\nProposed Exit\n. Additionally, the 2019 operating margin in our Healthcare segment was negatively impacted by client mergers within the segment and a dispute with a customer related to a large volume based contract. The increase in unallocated costs in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due\n6\nAdjusted Operating Margin is not a measurement of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n26\nto a smaller shortfall in 2020 than in 2019 of incentive-based compensation as compared to target, COVID-19 Charges and costs related to the ransomware attack, partially offset by the 2019 India Defined Contribution Obligation discussed in\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTotal other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, interest income and interest expense. The following table sets forth total other income (expense), net for the years ended December 31:\nThe foreign currency exchange gains and losses were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in our U.S. dollar functional currency India subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, the remeasurement of other net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. The gains and losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to non-U.S. dollar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2020, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $637 million. The decrease in interest income of $57 million was primarily attributable to lower yields in 2020.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $704 million in 2020 and $643 million in 2019. The effective income tax rate increased to 33.6% in 2020 as compared to 25.3% in 2019 primarily driven by the Tax on Accumulated Indian Earnings, the impact of the Proposed Exit, which was not deductible for tax purposes, and the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, which resulted in non-deductible foreign currency exchange losses in our consolidated statement of operations.\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments\nIn 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $57 million on one of our equity method investments as further described in\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income\nNet income was $1,392 million in 2020 and $1,842 million in 2019. Net income as a percentage of revenues decreased to 8.4% in 2020 from 11.0% in 2019. The decrease in net income was driven by lower income from operations, higher foreign currency exchange losses (inclusive of losses on our foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments), lower interest income and a higher provision for income taxes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nPortions of our disclosure include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, set forth below, should be carefully evaluated.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Income From Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude unusual items. Additionally, Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. The income tax impact of each item is calculated by applying the\n27\nstatutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period’s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues.\nWe believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the Company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for our executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-GAAP financial measures excluding certain costs provides a meaningful supplemental measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures along with reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure, as applicable, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.\nA limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and may exclude costs that are recurring such as our net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure for the years ended December 31:\n(1)    As part of our realignment program, during 2020,\nwe incurred employee retention costs and certain professional services fees and, during 2019, we incurred Executive Transition Costs, employee separation costs, employee retention costs and third party realignment costs.\nSee\nto our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(2)    As part of our 2020 Fit for Growth plan, during 2020, we incurred certain employee separation, employee retention and facility exit costs and other charges and, during 2019, we incurred certain employee separation, employee retention and facility exit costs under the plan. See\nto our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n28\n(3)    During\n2020,\nwe incurred costs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including a one-time bonus to our employees at the designation of associate and below in both India and the Philippines, certain costs to enable our employees to work remotely and provide medical staff and extra cleaning services for our facilities\n. Most of the costs related to the pandemic are reported in \"Cost of revenues\" in our consolidated statement of operations.\n(4)    In 2019, we recorded an accrual of $117 million related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation as further described in\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n(5)    Non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, inclusive of gains and losses on related foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes, are reported in \"Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(6)    Presented below are the tax impacts of each of our non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income:\n(7)    In 2020,\nwe reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on Indian earnings accumulated in prior years and recorded $140 million in income tax expense.\n(8)    In 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $57 million on one of our equity investments as further described in\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n(9)    In 2019, we recorded a one-time net income tax expense of $21 million as a result of the enactment of a new tax law in India.\nCash generated from operations has historically been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments t\no grow our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2,724 million. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we had available capacity under our credit facilities of approximately $1,928 million.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31:\nOperating activities\nThe increase in cash generated from operating activities for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by improved collections on our trade accounts receivable, deferrals of certain payments due to COVID-19 pandemic regulatory relief provided by several jurisdictions in which we operate, and lower incentive-based compensation payouts and cash taxes paid in 2020.\nWe monitor turnover, aging and the collection of trade accounts receivable by client. Our DSO calculation includes trade accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and contract assets, reduced by the uncollected portion of our deferred revenue. DSO was 70 days as of December 31, 2020 and 73 days as of December 31, 2019.\n29\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2020 was primarily driven by payments for acquisitions. Net cash provided by investing activities in\n2019\nwas driven by net sales of investments partially offset by payments for acquisitions and outflows for capital expenditures.\nFinancing activities\nThe de\ncrease in cash used in financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock in 2020.\nWe have a Credit Agreement providing for a $750 million Term Loan and a $1,750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which\nare due to mature in November 2023. We are required under the Credit Agree\nment to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan. See\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed $1.74 billion against our revolving credit facility and repaid this amount in full in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nWe believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020 and through the date of this filing. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility.\nIn February 2020, our India subsidiary renewed its one-year 13 billion Indian rupee ($178 million at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate)\nworking capital facility, which requires us to repay any balances drawn down within 90 days from the date of disbursement. There is a 1.0% prepayment penalty applicable to payments made within 30 days of\ndisbursement. This working capital facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and may be renewed annually in February. As of December 31, 2020, there was no balance outstanding under the working capital facility.\nDuring 2020, we returned\n$2,034 m\nillion to our stockholders throu\ngh $1,554 million\nin share repurchases under our stock repurchase program and $480 million in dividend payments. Our stock repurchase program, as amended by our Board of Directors in December 2020, allows for the repurchase of an aggregate of up to $9.5 billion, excluding fees and expenses, of our Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we have $2.8 billion, excluding fees and expenses, available for repurchases under the program. Our shares outstanding decreased to 530 million as of December 31, 2020 from 548 million as of December 31, 2019.\nWe review our capital return plan on an on-going basis, considering the potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, our financial performance and liquidity position, investments required\nto execute our strategic plans and initiatives, acquisition opportunities, the economic outlook, regulatory changes and other relevant factors. As these factors may change over time, the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity, dividends, and acquisitions, if any, during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time.\nOther Liquidity and Capital Resources Information\nWe seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances. We evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the United States.\nIn March 2020, the Indian parliamen\nt enacted the Budget of India, which contained a number of provisions related to income tax, including a replacement of the DDT, previously due from the dividend payer, with a tax payable by the shareholder receiving the dividend. This provision reduced the tax rate applicable to us for cash repatriated from India. Following this change, during the first quarter of 2020, we limited our indefinite reinvestment assertion to India earnings accumulated in prior years. In July 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released final regulations, which became effective in September 2020, that reduced the tax applicable on our accumulated Indian earnings upon repatriation. As a result, during the third quarter of 2020, after a thorough analysis of the impact of these changes in law on the cost of earnings repatriation and considering our strategic decision to increase our investments to accelerate growth in various international markets and expand\nour global delivery footprint, we\nreversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on Indian earnings accumulated in prior years and\nrecorded a $140 million Tax on Accumulated Indian Earnings. The recorded income tax expense reflects the India withholding tax on unrepatriated Indian earnings, which were $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, net of applicable U.S. foreign tax credits.\nOn October 28, 2020, our subsidiary in India remitted a dividend of $2.1 billion, which resulted in a net payment of $2.0 billion to its shareholders (non-Indian Cognizant entities), after payment of $106 million of India withholding tax.\n30\nWe expect our operating cash flows, cash and short-term investment balances, together with our available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements and service our debt for the next twelve months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, make acquisitions, meet our long-term capital requirements beyond a twelve-month period and execute our capital return plan will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all.\nCommitments\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments:\n(1)    Consists of scheduled repayments of our Term Loan.\n(2)    Interest on the Term Loan was calculated at interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020.\n(3)    Other purchase commitments include, among other things, communications and information technology obligations, as well as other obligations that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $193 million of unrecognized income tax benefits. This represents the income tax benefits associated with certain income tax positions on our U.S. and non-U.S. tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution of these income tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages, and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters.\nContingencies\nSee\nto our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOther than our foreign exchange forward and option contracts, there were no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2020 and 2019 that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. We evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis. However, the actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n31\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements as they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our significant accounting policies are described in\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\n. Revenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method, under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs. Revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, testing and business process services are recognized using the cost to cost method, if the right to invoice is not representative of the value being delivered. The cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information. Such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known. Net changes in estimates of such future costs and contract losses were immaterial to the consolidated results of operations for the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes.\nDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation allowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. We are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws, regulations and relevant guidelines. As a result, and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines, we have pending applications for APAs before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions. It could take years for the relevant taxing authorities to negotiate and conclude these applications. The consolidated provision for income taxes may change period to period based on changes in facts and circumstances, such as settlements of income tax audits or finalization of our applications for APAs.\nOur provision for income taxes also includes the impact of reserves established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related interest, which may require us to apply judgment to complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n. Goodwill and intangible assets, including indefinite-lived intangible assets, arise from the accounting for business combinations. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires us to estimate the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price utilizes estimates and assumptions\nin determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets, including the timing and amount of forecasted revenues and cash flows, anticipated growth rates, client attrition rates and the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nWe exercise judgment to allocate goodwill to the reporting units expected to benefit from each business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, regulatory environment, established business plans, operating performance indicators or competition. Evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis, and a market approach, using market multiples. Under the income approach, we estimate projected future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and long-term growth rates, and determine the appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows. The discount rate used is based on a market participant weighted-average cost of capital and may be adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenues and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on\n32\noperating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nWe also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. Our 2020 qualitative assessment included the review of relevant macroeconomic factors and entity-specific qualitative factors to determine if it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was below carrying value.\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 negatively affected all major economic and financial markets and, although there is a wide range of possible outcomes and the associated impact is highly dependent on variables that are difficult to forecast, we deemed the deterioration in general economic conditions sufficient to trigger an interim impairment testing of goodwill as of March 31, 2020. Our interim test results as of March 31, 2020 indicated that the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and thus, no impairment of goodwill existed as of March 31, 2020. Based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets performed during the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances in each of our reporting units were not at risk of impairment.\nWe review our finite-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever eve\nnts or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups. The impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Assessing the fair value of asset groups involves significant estimates and assumptions including estimation of future cash flows, the timing of such cash flows and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows.\nContingencies.\nLoss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, we do not record a liability, but instead disclose the nature and amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an exposure is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective and based on the information available from the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess any potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in estimates of any potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nSee\nto our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “should” or “anticipate” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing.\nSuch forward-looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the SEC, in press releases or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our anticipated future revenues or operating margin, earnings, capital expenditures, impacts to our business, financial results and financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, anticipated effective income tax rate and income tax expense, liquidity, access to capital, capital return plan, investment strategies, cost management, realignment program, 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, plans and objectives, including those related to our digital practice areas, investment in our business, potential acquisitions, industry trends, client behaviors and trends, the outcome of regulatory and litigation matters, the incremental accrual related to the India Defined Contribution Obligation, the Proposed Exit and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, are based on our current expectations, estimates and projections, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Actual results, performance, achievements and outcomes could differ materially from the results expressed in, or anticipated or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

    "text": "Foreign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to changes in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures.\nRevenues from our clients in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Rest of World represented 8.0%, 9.9% and 6.5%, respectively, of our 2020 revenues, and are typically denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, our revenues may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates, primarily the British pound and the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar.\nA significant portion of our costs in India are denominated in the Indian rupee, representing approximately 20.0% of our global operating costs during 2020, and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations.\nWe have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2020, the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts by year of maturity were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the net unrealized\ngain o\nn our outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges was\n$70 million\n. Based upon a sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2020, which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges of approximately\n$224 million\n.\nA portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2020, we reported foreign currency exchange\nlosses, exclusiv\ne of hedging losses, of approximately $53 million, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. We use foreign exchange forward contracts to provide an economic hedge against balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2021. At December 31, 2020, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was\n$637 million\nand th\ne net unrealized gain\nwas less than $1 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2020, which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately\n$17 million\n.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have a Credit Agreement providing for a $750 million unsecured Term Loan and a $1,750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which are due to mature in November 2023. We are required under the Credit Agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan.\nThe Credit Agreement requires interest to be paid, at our option, at either the ABR or the Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, an Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Initially, the Applicable Margin is 0.875% with respect to Eurocurrency Rate loans and 0.00% with respect to ABR loans. Subsequently, the\n37\nApplicable Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Rate loans may range from 0.75% to 1.125%, depending on our public debt ratings (or, if we have not received public debt ratings, from 0.875% to 1.125%, depending on our Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement). Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which vary based on our public debt ratings (or, if we have not received public debt ratings, on the Leverage Ratio). Thus, our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense. A 10.0% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense.\nInformation provided by the sensitivity analysis of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk does not necessarily represent the actual changes that would occur under normal market conditions."

Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Responsibility for Financial Statements\nOur management is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of all information presented in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Management believes the consolidated financial statements fairly reflect the form and substance of transactions and that the financial statements fairly represent the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, meets regularly with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and representatives of management to review accounting, financial reporting, internal control and audit matters, as well as the nature and extent of the audit effort.\n38\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our chief executive and chief financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n.\nBased on its evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included on page F-2.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Controls\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate."

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nF-2\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition – Expected Labor Costs to Complete for Certain Fixed-Price Contracts\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, fixed-price contracts comprised $6.1 billion of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes performance obligations where control is transferred over time. For performance obligations where control is transferred over time, revenues are recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the deliverables to be provided. Management recognizes revenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology services as the service is performed using the cost to cost method, under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs. The cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information. Revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, testing and business process services are recognized based on management’s right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered. If management’s invoicing is not consistent with value delivered, revenues are recognized as the service is performed based on the cost to cost method described above.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition – expected labor costs to complete for certain fixed-price contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated total expected labor costs to complete fixed-price contracts and the significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s estimate of total expected labor costs\n.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the development of the estimated total expected labor costs to complete fixed-price contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for developing the estimated total expected labor costs for a sample of contracts, which included evaluating the reasonableness of the total expected labor cost assumptions used by management.  Evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions related to the total expected labor costs involved assessing management’s ability to reasonably develop total expected labor costs by (i) performing a comparison of actual labor costs incurred with expected labor costs for similar completed projects and (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to previous labor cost estimates, including actual labor costs in excess of estimates.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 12, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\nF-3\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(in millions, except par values)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-4\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(in millions, except per share data)\n(1)    Reflects    the adoption of the New Revenue Standard as well as ASU 2018-02 \"Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\" on January 1, 2018.\n(2)    Reflects    the adoption of the New Lease Standard on January 1, 2019.\n(3)\nReflects the adoption of the Credit Loss Standard as described in\n.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in millions)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\nF-8\nCOGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share data)\nThe terms “Cognizant,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\nDescription of Business.\nWe are one of the world’s leading professional services companies, engineering modern business for the digital era. Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Digital services have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. We are focused on continued investment in four key areas of digital: IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers.\nBasis of Presentation, Principles of Consolidation and Use of Estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of our consolidated subsidiaries for all periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. The COVID-19 pandemic may affect management's estimates and assumptions of variable consideration in contracts with customers as well as other estimates and assumptions, in particular those that require a projection of our financial results, our cash flows or broader economic conditions, such as the annual effective tax rate, the allowance for doubtful accounts, the recoverability of capitalized deferred charges and the fair value of goodwill, long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets We evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual amounts may vary from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all cash balances, including money market funds, certificates of deposits and commercial paper that have a maturity, at the date of purchase, of 90 days or less.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the date of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. Our held-to-maturity investment securities are financial instruments for which we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and we classify these securities with maturities less than one year as short-term investments. Any held-to-maturity investment securities with maturities beyond one year from the balance sheet date are classified as noncurrent. Held-to-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost. Interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for debt securities are included in interest income.\nOn initial recognition and on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our held-to-maturity investment securities for expected credit losses collectively when they share similar risk characteristics or individually, when the risk characteristics are different. The allowance for expected credit losses is determined using our historical loss experience. We monitor the credit ratings of the securities in our portfolio to evaluate the need for any changes to the allowance. An increase or a decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses is recorded through income as a credit loss expense or a reversal thereof. The allowance for expected credit losses is presented as a deduction from the amortized cost. A held-to-maturity investment security is written off when deemed uncollectible.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities.\nCash and certain cash equivalents, time deposits, trade receivables, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities are short-term in nature and, accordingly, their carrying values approximate fair value.\nProperty and Equipment.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Deposits paid towards acquisition of long-lived assets and the cost of assets not put in use by the balance sheet date are disclosed under the caption \"Capital work-in-progress\" in\n.\nF-9\nLeases.\nOur lease asset classes primarily consist of operating leases for office space, data centers and IT equipment. At inception of a contract, we determine whether a contract contains a lease, and if a lease is identified, whether it is an operating or finance lease. In determining whether a contract contains a lease we consider whether (1) we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the term of the contract, (2) we have the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the term of the contract and (3) we have the right to operate the asset throughout the term of the contract without the lessor having the right to change the terms of the contract. Some of our lease agreements contain both lease and non-lease components that we account for as a single lease component for all of our lease asset classes.\nOur ROU lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and may include any advance lease payments made and any initial direct costs and exclude lease incentives. Our lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the terms of the lease. ROU lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease and are calculated using the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Typically, our lease agreements do not provide sufficient detail to arrive at an implicit interest rate. Therefore, we use our estimated country-specific incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date of the lease to calculate the present value of the lease payments. In estimating our country-specific incremental borrowing rates, we consider market rates of comparable collateralized borrowings for similar terms. Our lease terms may include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the contractual lease term. Our ROU lease assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\nA portion of our real estate lease costs is subject to annual changes in the CPI. The changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Other variable lease costs primarily relate to adjustments for common area maintenance, utilities, property tax and lease concessions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These variable costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nWe elect not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with a term equal to or less than 12 months. We recognize the lease payments in our income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nBoth ROU assets and finance lease assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset group may not be recoverable.\nInternal Use Software.\nWe capitalize certain costs that are incurred to purchase, develop and implement internal-use software during the application development phase, which primarily include coding, testing and certain data conversion activities. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the software. Costs incurred in performing planning and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.\nCloud Computing Arrangements.\nWe capitalize certain implementation costs within prepaid assets that are incurred when implementing cloud computing service or SaaS arrangements, which primarily include efforts associated with configuration and development activities. Once the service is ready for use, capitalized costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement and recognized in income from operations.\nSoftware to be Sold, Leased or Marketed.\nWe capitalize costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached but before software is available for general release to clients, which primarily include coding and testing activities.\nOnce the product is ready for general release, capitalized costs are amortized over the useful life of the software.\nBusiness Combinations.\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their expected useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date\n.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company adjusted the allocation of the purchase price of certain prior period acquisitions that included revenue contracts with the sellers of the acquired businesses. As a result, we recorded a balance sheet adjustment to decrease total assets (primarily impacting intangible assets, goodwill and deferred income taxes) and total liabilities (primarily impacting deferred revenue) by approximately $\n70\nmillion each. The impact of the adjustment to our\nF-10\noperating results was immaterial. Management concluded that the adjustment was not material to any previously issued consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nEquity Method Investments.\nEquity investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and recorded in the caption \"Long-term investments\" on our consolidated statements of financial position. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost. We periodically review the carrying value of our equity method investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in the carrying value. The investment balance is increased to reflect contributions and our share of earnings and decreased to reflect our share of losses, distributions, and other-than-temporary impairments. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of the investee is recorded in the caption \"Income (loss) from equity method investments\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLong-lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets.\nWe review long-lived assets and certain finite-lived identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. The carrying amount may not be recoverable when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset groups. The impairment loss is determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and developed technology, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. An impairment of goodwill exists if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, if our annual qualitative assessment indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we test the assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of such assets to their carrying value. If an impairment is indicated, a write down to the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible asset is recorded.\nStock Repurchase Program.\nUnder the Board of Directors authorized stock repurchase program, the Company is authorized to repurchase its Class A common stock through open market purchases,\nincluding under a 10b5-1 Plan, or in private transactions, including through ASR agreements entered into with financial institutions, in accordance with applica\nble federal securities laws. We account for the repurchased shares as constructively retired. Shares are returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares at the time of repurchase or in the periods they are delivered if repurchased under an ASR. To reflect share repurchases in the consolidated statements of financial position, we (1) reduce common stock for the par value of the shares, (2) reduce additional paid-in capital for the amount in excess of par during the period in which the shares are repurchased and (3) record any residual amount in excess of available additional paid-in capital to retained earnings. Upfront payments related to ASRs are accounted for as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the consolidated statements of financial position in the period the payments are made.\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe recognize revenues as we transfer control of deliverables (products, solutions and services) to our clients in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. To recognize revenues, we apply the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from all parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. We apply judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intention to pay based on a variety of factors including the customer’s historical payment experience.\nFor performance obligations where control is transferred over time, revenues are recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the deliverables to be provided.\nRevenues related to fixed-price contracts for application development and systems integration services, consulting or other technology services are recognized as the service is performed using the cost to cost method, under which the total value of revenues is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract’s total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor costs. Revenues related to fixed-price application maintenance, testing and business process services are recognized based on our right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered. If our invoicing is not consistent with the value delivered, revenues are recognized as the service is performed based on the cost to cost method described above. The cost to cost method requires estimation of future costs, which is updated as the project progresses to reflect the latest available information; such estimates and changes in estimates involve the use of judgment. The\nF-11\ncumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately, where appropriate.\nRevenues related to fixed-price hosting and infrastructure services are recognized based on our right to invoice for services performed for contracts in which the invoicing is representative of the value being delivered. If our invoicing is not consistent with the value delivered, revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. The revenue recognition method applied to the types of contracts described above provides the most faithful depiction of performance towards satisfaction of our performance obligations; for example, the cost to cost method is used when the value of services provided to the customer is best represented by the costs expended to deliver those services.\nRevenues related to our time-and-materials, transaction-based or volume-based contracts are recognized over the period the services are provided either using an output method such as labor hours, or a method that is otherwise consistent with the way in which value is delivered to the customer.\nRevenues related to our non-hosted software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when the software is delivered as control is transferred at a point in time. For software license arrangements that require significant functionality enhancements or modification of the software, revenues for the software license and related services are recognized as the services are performed in accordance with the methods applicable to application development and systems integration services described above. In software hosting arrangements, the rights provided to the customer, such as ownership of a license, contract termination provisions and the feasibility of the client to operate the software, are considered in determining whether the arrangement includes a license or a service. Sales and usage-based fees promised in exchange for licenses of intellectual property are not recognized as revenue until the uncertainty related to the variable amounts is resolved. Revenues related to software maintenance and support are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period.\nIncentive revenues, volume discounts, or any other form of variable consideration is estimated using either the sum of probability weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts (expected value) or the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (most likely amount), depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which we may be entitled. We include in the transaction price variable consideration only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenues recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether and when to include estimated amounts in the transaction price may involve judgment and are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available to us.\nRevenues also include the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. Our warranties generally provide a customer with assurance that the related deliverable will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications and is therefore not considered an additional performance obligation in the contract.\nWe may enter into arrangements that consist of multiple performance obligations. Such arrangements may include any combination of our deliverables. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised deliverables, we apply judgment to determine whether promised deliverables are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised deliverables are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. For arrangements with multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate consideration among the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to the customer. When not directly observable, we typically estimate standalone selling price by using the expected cost plus a margin approach. We typically establish a standalone selling price range for our deliverables, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change.\nWe assess the timing of the transfer of goods or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. As a practical expedient, we do not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set up or transition fees paid upfront by our customers to represent a financing component, as such fees are required to encourage customer commitment to the project and protect us from early termination of the contract.\nF-12\nOur contracts may be modified to add, remove or change existing performance obligations. The accounting for modifications to our contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price. Services added to our application development and systems integration service contracts are typically not distinct, while services added to our other contracts, including application maintenance, testing and business process services contracts, are typically distinct.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). In doing so, we first evaluate whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, we are the principal; if not, we are the agent. Determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer may require judgment.\nTrade Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities.\nWe classify our right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment is due). For example, we recognize a receivable for revenues related to our time and materials and transaction or volume-based contracts when earned regardless of whether amounts have been billed. We present such receivables in \"Trade accounts receivable, net\" in our consolidated statements of financial position at their net estimated realizable value. A contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets are presented in \"Other current assets\" in our consolidated statements of financial position and primarily relate to unbilled amounts on fixed-price contracts utilizing the cost to cost method of revenue recognition. Our contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, consist of advance payments from clients and billings in excess of revenues recognized. We classify deferred revenue as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the revenues.\nOur contract assets and contract liabilities are reported on a net basis by contract at the end of each reporting period. The difference between the opening and closing balances of our contract assets and contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between our performance obligations and the client’s payment. We receive payments from clients based on the terms established in our contracts, which vary by contract type.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses\n. We calculate expected credit losses for our trade accounts receivable and contract assets. Expected credit losses include losses expected based on known credit issues with specific customers as well as a general expected credit loss allowance based on relevant information about past events, including historical loss rates, current conditions, and reasonable economic forecasts that affect collectibility. We update our allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis with changes in the allowance recognized in income from operations.\nCosts to Fulfill.\nRecurring operating costs for contracts with customers are recognized as incurred. Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (i.e., set-up or transition costs) are capitalized when such costs (1) relate directly to the contract, (2) generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future, and (3) are expected to be recovered. These costs are expensed ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship, including expected contract renewals. In determining the estimated life of the customer relationship, we evaluate the average contract term, on a portfolio basis by nature of the services to be provided, and apply judgment in evaluating the rate of technological and industry change. Capitalized amounts are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs to fulfill.\nStock-Based Compensation.\nStock-based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and non-employee directors is determined based on the grant date fair value of those awards. We recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the requisite service period of the award. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from original estimates. Stock-based compensation costs for PSUs that vest proportionally are recognized on a graded-vesting basis over the vesting period based on the most probable outcome of the performance conditions. If the minimum performance targets are not met, no compensation cost is recognized and any recognized compensation\ncost is reversed except for awards subject to a market condition. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is determined based on the number of stock units granted and the quoted price of our stock at the date of grant. The fair value of PSUs granted subject to a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\nForeign Currency.\nThe assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly\nF-13\nexchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the caption \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" on the consolidated statements of financial position.\nForeign currency transactions and balances are those that are denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency. An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for some of our foreign subsidiaries. For these subsidiaries, transactions and balances denominated in the local currency are foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency transactions and balances related to non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency of the entity at historical exchange rates while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency of the entity at current exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange gains or losses from remeasurement are included in the caption \"Foreign currency exchange gain (losses), net\" on our consolidated statements of operations together with gains or losses on our undesignated foreign currency hedges.\nDerivative Financial Instruments.\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated statements of financial position as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. Our derivative financial instruments consist primarily of foreign exchange forward and option contracts. For derivative financial instruments to qualify for hedge accounting, the following criteria must be met: (1) the hedging instrument must be designated as a hedge; (2) the hedged exposure must be specifically identifiable and must expose us to risk; and (3) it must be expected that a change in fair value of the hedging instrument and an opposite change in the fair value of the hedged exposure will have a high degree of correlation. Changes in our derivatives’ fair values are recognized in net income unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are designated and accounted for as hedges). We record the effective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in the caption \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in the consolidated statements of financial position. Any ineffectiveness or excluded portion of a designated cash flow hedge is recognized in net income. Upon occurrence of the hedged transaction, the gains and losses on the derivative are recognized in net income.\nIncome Taxes.\nWe provide for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date.\nOur provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as any related penalties and interest. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nEarnings Per Share.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS includes all potential dilutive common stock in the weighted average shares outstanding. We exclude from the calculation of diluted EPS options with exercise prices that are greater than the average market price and shares related to stock-based awards whose combined exercise price and unamortized fair value were greater in each of those periods than the average market price of our common stock for the period, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. We excluded less than\n1\nmillion of anti-dilutive shares in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018 from our diluted EPS calculation. We include PSUs in the dilutive potential common shares when they become contingently issuable per the authoritative guidance and exclude them when they are not contingently issuable.\nF-14\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nF-15\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe tables below present disaggregated revenues from contracts with clients by client location, service line and contract-type for each of our business segments. We believe this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by industry, market and other economic factors. Our consulting and technology services include consulting, application development, systems integration, and application testing services as well as software solutions and related services while our outsourcing services include application maintenance, infrastructure and business process services. Revenues are attributed to geographic regions based upon client location. Substantially all of the revenue in our North America region relates to operations in the United States.\nF-16\nF-17\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we made an offer to settle and exit a large customer engagement in Financial Services in Continental Europe. The offer includes, among other terms, a proposed payment and the forgiveness of certain receivables. The 2020 impact of the Proposed Exit was a reduction of\nrevenues of $\n118\nmillion and additional expenses of $\n33\nmillion, primarily related to the impairment of long-lived assets. While the amounts recorded are based on our best estimate of the expected terms of the exit, the negotiations are ongoing and, as such, we may not reach an agreement or the final terms of the agreement that is reached may materially differ from those contemplated in our accounting. In either instance, there could be additional impacts to our statement of operations, financial condition and our cash flows.\nCosts to Fulfill\nThe following table presents information related to the capitalized costs to fulfill, such as setup or transition activities\n.\nCosts to fulfill are recorded in \"Other noncurrent assets\" in our consolidated statements of financial position and the amortization expense of costs to fulfill is included in \"Cost of revenues\" in our consolidated statement of operations. Costs to obtain contracts were immaterial for the period disclosed.\nContract Balances\nA contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets are presented in \"Other current assets\" in our consolidated statements of financial position and primarily relate to unbilled amounts on fixed-price contracts utilizing the cost to cost method of revenue recognition.\nThe table below shows significant movements in contract assets:\nOur contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenues recognized. The table below shows significant movements in the deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent):\n(1)    See the\nBusiness Combinations\nsection in\n.\nRevenues recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 for performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods were immaterial.\nF-18\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, was\n$\n1,446\nmillion\n, of which approximately\n75\n% is expected to be recognized as revenues within\n2\nyears. Disclosure is not required for performance obligations that meet any of the following criteria:\n(1)\ncontracts with a duration of one year or less as determined under th\ne New Revenue Standard,\n(2)\ncontracts for which we recognize revenues based on the right to invoice for services performed,\n(3)\nvariable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-14(b), for which the criteria in ASC 606-10-32-40 have been met, or\n(4)\nvariable consideration in the form of a sales-based or usage based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.\nMany of our performance obligations meet one or more of these exemptions and therefore are not included in the remaining performance obligation amount disclosed above.\nTrade Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe calculate expected credit losses for our trade accounts receivable based on historical credit loss rates for each aging category as adjusted for the current market conditions and forecasts about future economic conditions.\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for our trade accounts receivable:\nAcquisitions completed during each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not individually or in the aggregate material to our operations. Accordingly, pro forma results have not been presented. We have allocated the purchase price related to these transactions to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, including deductible and non-deductible goodwill, based on their estimated fair values. The primary items that generated goodwill are the value of the acquired assembled workforces and synergies between the acquired companies and us, neither of which qualify as an amortizable intangible asset.\n2020\nIn 2020, we acquired\n100\n% ownership of:\n•\nCode Zero, a provider of consulting and implementation services acquired to strengthen our cloud solutions portfolio and Salesforce Configure-Price-Quote and billing capabilities (acquired on January 31, 2020);\n•\nLev, a Salesforce Platinum Partner specializing in digital marketing consultancy and implementation of custom cloud solutions acquired to further expand our global Salesforce practice (acquired on March 27, 2020);\n•\nEI-Technologies, a digital technology consulting firm and leading Salesforce specialist acquired to expand our global Salesforce practice (acquired on May 29, 2020);\n•\nCollaborative Solutions, a provider of Workday enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources acquired to strengthen our portfolio of cloud offerings (acquired on June 10, 2020);\n•\nNew Signature, an independent Microsoft public cloud transformation company acquired to expand our hyperscale cloud advisory services and provide the foundation for our new, dedicated practice centered on Microsoft cloud solutions (acquired on August 18, 2020);\nF-19\n•\nthe net assets of Tin Roof, a custom software and digital product development services company acquired to expand our software product engineering footprint in the United States (acquired on September 16, 2020);\n•\n10\nth\nMagnitude, a leading cloud specialist focused on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform acquired to expand our Microsoft Azure expertise (acquired on September 30, 2020);\n•\nthe net assets of Bright Wolf, a technology service provider specializing in customer Industrial IoT solutions acquired to expand our smart products offering and expertise in architecting and implementing Industrial IoT solutions (acquired on November 2, 2020); and\n•\nInawisdom, an Amazon Web Services consulting partner with expertise in AI, machine learning, and data analytics acquired to expand our client services in Europe and strengthen our end-to-end cloud-native AI and machine learning solutions portfolio (acquired on December 18, 2020).\nThe allocations of preliminary purchase price to the fair value of the aggregate assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:\n(1)\nThe purchase price for our acquisitions includes contingent consideration components with a collective maximum payout of $\n59\nmillion, valued at $\n42\nmillion at the date of acquisition, which is contingent upon achieving certain performance thresholds during the first two calendar years following the date of acquisition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, revenues from acquisitions completed in 2020, since the dates of acquisition, were $\n222\nmillion.\nFor acquisitions completed in 2020, the allocation is preliminary and will be finalized as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but in no event later than one year following the date of acquisition.\n2019\nIn 2019, we acquired\n100\n% ownership of:\n•\nMustache, a creative content agency based in the United States, acquired to extend our capabilities in creating original and branded content for digital, broadcast and social mediums (acquired on January 15, 2019);\n•\nMeritsoft, a financial software company based in Ireland, acquired to complement our service offerings to capital markets institutions (acquired on March 4, 2019);\n•\nSamlink, a developer of services and solutions for the financial sector based in Finland, acquired to strengthen our banking capabilities and create a strategic partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform (acquired on April 1, 2019);\n•\nZenith, a life sciences company based in Ireland, acquired to extend our service capabilities for connected biopharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers (acquired on July 29, 2019); and\n•\nContino, a technology consulting firm acquired to extend our capabilities in enterprise DevOps and cloud transformation (acquired on October 31, 2019).\nF-20\nThe allocations of purchase price to the fair value of the aggregate assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:\nDuring 2020, we incurred costs related to both our realignment program and our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan. Our realignment program, which began in 2017, improved our client focus, our cost structure and the efficiency and effectiveness of our delivery while continuing to drive revenue growth. Our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, which began in the fourth quarter of 2019, simplified our organizational model and optimized our cost structure in order to partially fund the investments required to execute on our strategy and advance our growth agenda and included our decision to exit certain content-related services that were not in line with our strategic vision for the Company. The total costs related to our realignment program and our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan are reported in \"Restructuring charges\" in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe do not allocate these charges to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, such expenses are included in our segment reporting as “unallocated costs”. See\n.\nCharges related to our realignment program and our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan were as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes $\n7\nmillion of accelerated depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe 2020 Fit for Growth Plan charges include $\n23\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion of costs incurred in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to our exit from certain content-related services.\nF-21\nChanges in our accrued employee separation costs, for both our realignment program and our 2020 Fit for Growth Plan, included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in our consolidated statements of financial position, are presented in the table below.\nOur investments were as follows as of December 31:\n(1)\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, $\n405\nmillion in restricted time deposits related to deposits under lien with the ITD were classified as long-term. As of December 31, 2019,\n$\n414\nmillion\nin restricted time deposits were classified as short-term.\nSee\n.\nEquity Investment Security\nOur equity investment security is a U.S. dollar denominated investment in a fixed income mutual fund. Realized and unrealized gains and losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAvailable-for-Sale Investment Securities\nDuring 2019, all\nof our available-for-sale investment securities either matured or were sold. We determine the cost of the securities sold based on the specific identification method.\nProceeds from sales of available-for-sale investment securities and the gross gains and losses that have been included in earnings as a result of those sales were as follows:\nF-22\nHeld-to-Maturity Investment Securities\nOur held-to-maturity investment securities consist of Indian rupee denominated investments primarily in commercial paper and international corporate bonds. Our investment guidelines are to purchase securities that are investment grade at the time of acquisition. The basis for the measurement of fair value of our held-to-maturity investments is Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of held-to-maturity investment securities were as follows as of December 31:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were\nno\nheld-to-maturity investment securities in an unrealized loss position.\nAs of December 31, 2019,\n$\n70\nmillion\nin commercial paper and $\n42\nmillion in corporate and other debt securities were in an unrealized loss position, the total unrealized loss was less than $\n1\nmillion and\nnone\nof the securities had been in an unrealized loss position for longer than 12 months.\nThe sec\nurities in our portfolio are highly rated and short-term in nature. As of December 31, 2020, our corporate and other debt securities were rated AAA by CRISIL, an Indian subsidiary of S&P Global.\nEquity and Cost Method Investments\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had equity method investments of $\n31\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively. During 2020, we acquired a\n$\n26\nmillion\nequity method investment in the technology sector. In addition, we have an equity method investment which consists of a\n49\n%\nownership interest in a strategic consulting firm specializing in the use of human sciences to help business leaders better understand customer behavior. During 2019, as a result of events indicating one of our investments experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, we assessed its fair value and determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value. As such, we recorded an impairment charge of $\n57\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2019 within the caption \"Income (loss) from equity method investments\" in our consolidated statement of operations. In determining the fair value of the equity method investment we considered results from the following valuation methodologies: income approach, based on discounted future cash flows, market approach, based on current market multiples and net asset value approach, based on the assets and liabilities of the investee. The basis for the measurement of fair value for this equity method investment is Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cost method investments of $\n4\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion, respectively.\nF-23\nProperty and equipment were as follows as of December 31:\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $\n407\nmillion, $\n363\nmillion and $\n347\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe gross amount of property and equipment recorded under finance leases was $\n37\nmillion and\n$\n30\nmillion\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accumulated amortization for our ROU finance lease assets was $\n23\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to our ROU finance lease assets was $\n7\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to our capital lease assets was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe gross amount of property and equipment recorded for software to be sold, leased or marketed reported in the caption \"Computer software\" above was $\n159\nmillion and $\n129\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accumulated amortization for software to be sold, leased or marketed was $\n73\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense for software to be sold, leased or marketed recorded as property and equipment was $\n30\nmillion,\n$\n22\nmillion\nand $\n14\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table provides information on the components of our operating and finance leases included in our consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31:\nF-24\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our operating lease costs were $\n302\nmillion and $\n264\nmillion, respectively, including variable lease costs of $\n14\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively. Our short-term lease rental expense was $\n20\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Lease interest expense related to our finance leases for years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was immaterial.\nThe following table provides information on the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for our operating leases as of December 31:\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow information related to our operating leases as of December 31:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of finance lease liabilities and ROU assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities were each immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table provides the schedule of maturities of our operating lease liabilities and a reconciliation of the undiscounted cash flows to the operating lease liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position as of December 31:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $\n92\nmillion of additional obligations related to operating leases whose lease term had yet to commence and which are therefore not included in our statement of financial position. These leases are primarily related to real estate and will commence in various months in 2021 and 2022 with lease terms of\n1\nyear to\n11\nyears.\nChanges in goodwill by our reportable segments were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nF-25\n(1)    See the\nBusiness Combinations\nsection in\n.\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2020, COVID-19 negatively affected all major economic and financial markets and, although there is a wide range of possible outcomes and the associated impact is highly dependent on variables that are difficult to forecast, we deemed the deterioration in general economic conditions sufficient to trigger an interim impairment testing of goodwill as of March 31, 2020. Our interim test results as of March 31, 2020 indicated that the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and thus, no impairment of goodwill existed as of March 31, 2020. Based on our most recent goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 31, 2020, we concluded that the goodwill in each of our reporting units was not at risk of impairment. We have not recognized any impairment losses on our goodwill.\nComponents of intangible assets were as follows as of December 31:\nOther than certain trademarks with indefinite lives, our intangible assets have finite lives and, as such, are subject to amortization. Amortization of intangible assets totaled $\n152\nmillion for 2020, $\n162\nmillion for 2019 and $\n151\nmillion for 2018.\nThe following table provides the estimated amortization expense related to our existing intangible assets for the next five years.\nF-26\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities were as follows as of December 31:\nIn 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement providing\nfor a $\n750\nmillion Term Loan and a $\n1,750\nmillion uns\necured revolving credit facility, which are due to mature in November 2023. We are required under the Credit Agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan.\nThe Credit Agreement requires interest to be paid, at our option, at either the ABR or the Eurocurrency Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, an Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Initially, the Applicable Margin is\n0.875\n% with respect to Eurocurrency Rate loans and\n0.00\n% with respect to ABR loans. Subsequently, the Applicable Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Rate loans may range from\n0.75\n% to\n1.125\n%, depending on our public debt ratings (or, if we have not received public debt ratings, from\n0.875\n% to\n1.125\n%, depending on our Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement). Our Credit Agreement also provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest to the Eurocurrency rate after LIBOR is no longer available. Under the Credit Agreement, we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, which vary based on our public debt ratings (or, if we have not received public debt ratings, on the Leverage Ratio). As the interest rates on our Term Loan and any notes outstanding under the revolving credit facility are variable, the fair value of our debt balances approximates their carrying value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as a financial covenant. The financial covenant is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and requires us to maintain a Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, not in excess of\n3.50\nto 1.00, or for a period of up to four quarters following certain material acquisitions,\n3.75\nto 1.00. We were in compliance with all debt covenants and representations of the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020.\nIn February 2020, our India subsidiary renewed its\n13\nbillion Indian rupee ($\n178\nmillion at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate) working capital facility, which requires us to repay any balances within 90 days from the date of disbursement.\nThere is a 1.0% prepayment penalty applicable to payments made within 30 days of\ndisbursement. This working capital facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and may be renewed annually in February. As of December 31, 2020, we have not borrowed funds under this facility.\nShort-term Debt\nThe following summarizes our short-term debt balances as of December 31:\nF-27\nLong-term Debt\nThe following summarizes our long-term debt balances as of December 31:\nThe following represents the schedule of maturities of our term loan:\nIncome before provision for income taxes shown below is based on the geographic location to which such income was attributed for years ended December 31:\nThe provision for income taxes consisted of the following components for the years ended December 31:\nIn March 2020, the Indian parliament enacted the Budget of India, which contained a number of provisions related to income tax, including a replacement of the DDT, previously due from the dividend payer, with a tax payable by the shareholder receiving the dividend. This provision reduced the tax rate applicable to us for cash repatriated from India. Following this change, during the first quarter of 2020, we limited our indefinite reinvestment assertion to India earnings accumulated in prior years. In July 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released final regulations on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\"), which became effective in September 2020, that reduced the tax applicable on our accumulated Indian earnings upon repatriation. As a result, during the third quarter of 2020, after a thorough analysis of the impact of these changes in law on the cost of earnings repatriation and considering our strategic decision to increase our investments to accelerate growth in various international markets and expand our global delivery footprint, we\nreversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on Indian earnings accumulated in prior years and\nrecorded a $\n140\nmillion Tax on Accumulated Indian Earnings. The recorded income tax expense reflects the India withholding tax on unrepatriated Indian earnings, which were $\n5.2\nbillion as of December 31, 2019, net of applicable U.S. foreign tax credits.\nOn October 28, 2020, our subsidiary in India remitted a dividend\nF-28\nof $\n2.1\nbillion, which resulted in a net payment of $\n2.0\nbillion to its shareholders (non-Indian Cognizant entities), after payment of $\n106\nmillion of\nIndia withholding tax.\nWe are involved in an ongoing dispute with the ITD in connection with a previously disclosed 2016 share repurchase transaction undertaken by C\nTS India to repurchase shares from its shareholders (non-Indian Cognizant entities) valued at $\n2.8\nbillion. As a result of that transaction, which was undertaken pursuant to a plan approved by the High Court in Chennai, India, we previously paid $\n135\nmillion in\nIndian income taxes - an amount we believe includes all the applicable taxes owed for this transaction under Indian law. In March 2018, we received a communication from the ITD asserting that the ITD is owed an additional\n33\nbillion Indian rupees ($\n452\nmillion at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate) on the 2016 transaction. Immediately thereafter, the ITD placed an attachment on certain of our India bank accounts. In addition to the dispute on the 2016 transaction, we are also involved in another ongoing dispute with the ITD relating to a 2013 transaction undertaken by CTS India to repurchase shares from its shareholders valued at\n$\n523\nmillion\n(the two disputes collectively referred to as the \"ITD Dispute\").\nIn April 2018, the High Court admitted our writ petition for a stay of the actions of the ITD and lifted the ITD’s attachment on our bank accounts. As part of the interim stay order, we deposited\n5\nbillion Indian rupees ($\n68\nmillion at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate and $\n70\nmillion at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate) representing\n15\n% of the disputed tax amount related to the 2016 transaction, with the ITD. In addition, the Court also placed a lien on certain time deposits of CTS India in the amount of\n28\nbillion Indian rupees ($\n384\nmillion at the December 31, 2020 exchange rate and $\n393\nmillion at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate), which is the remainder of the disputed tax amount related to the 2016 transaction. In June 2019, the High Court dismissed our previously admitted writ petitions on the ITD Dispute, holding that the Company must exhaust other remedies, such as pursuing the matter before other appellate bodies, for resolution of the ITD Dispute prior to intervention by the High Court. The High Court did not issue a ruling on the substantive issue of whether we owe additional tax as a result of either the 2016 or the 2013 transaction. In July 2019, we appealed the High Court’s orders before the Division Bench. In September 2019, the Division Bench partly allowed the Company’s appeal with respect to the 2016 transaction, but did not issue a ruling on the substantive issue of the tax implications of the transactions. In October 2019, we filed a SLP before the SCI with respect to the 2016 transaction.\nIn March 2020, the SCI referred the case based on the 2016 transaction back to the ITD with directions to carry out the assessment following the due process\nof law. Further, until the conclusion of the assessment, the SCI maintained in place the lien on\nour\n28\nbillion Indian rupees time deposit and did not order the release of the\n5\nbillion Indian rupees deposit held by the ITD. In April 2020, we received an assessment from the\nITD, which is consistent with its previous assertions regarding our 2016 transaction. In June 2020, we filed an appeal against this assessment. The ruling of the SCI and the ITD's assessment created additional uncertainty as to the timing of the resolution of this case and, as a result, in the first quarter of 2020 we reclassified the deposits under lien, which are considered restricted assets, and the deposit with the ITD to noncurrent assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of deposits under lien was $\n405\nmillion presented in \"Long-term investments\" and\n$\n414\nmillion\npresented in \"Short-term investments\", respectively, including a portion of the interest previously earned. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the deposit with the ITD was $\n68\nmillion presented in \"Other noncurrent assets\" and $\n70\nmillion presented in \"Other current assets\", respectively.\nWe believe we have paid all applicable taxes owed on both the 2016 and the 2013 transactions. Accordingly, we have not recorded any reserves for these matters as of December 31, 2020.\nF-29\nThe reconciliation between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nThe significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position were as follows as of December 31:\nAt December 31, 2020, we had foreign and U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n55\nmillion and $\n98\nmillion, respectively. We have recorded valuation allowances on certain net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred income tax assets related to the MAT carryforwards were $\n98\nmillion and $\n176\nmillion, respectively. The calculation of the MAT includes all profits realized by our Indian subsidiaries and any MAT paid is creditable against future corporate income tax, subject to certain limitations.\nOur Indian subsidiaries are primarily export-oriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the government of India for export activities conducted within SEZs for periods of up to\n15\nyears. Our SEZ income tax holiday benefits are currently scheduled to expire in whole or in part through the year 2028 and may be extended on a limited basis for an additional five years per unit if certain reinvestment criteria are met. Our Indian profits ineligible for SEZ benefits are subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 34.94%. In addition, all Indian profits, including those generated within SEZs, are subject to the MAT. The current rate of MAT is 17.47%. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effect of the income tax holidays granted by the Indian government was to reduce the overall income tax provision and increase net\nF-30\nincome by $\n48\nmillion, $\n90\nmillion and $\n146\nmillion, respectively, and increase diluted EPS by $\n0.09\n, $\n0.16\nand $\n0.25\n, respectively.\nIn December 2019, the Government of India enacted the India Tax Law effective retroactively to April 1, 2019 that enables Indian companies to elect to be taxed at a lower income tax rate of 25.17%, as compared to the current income tax rate of 34.94%. Once a company elects into the lower income tax rate, a company may not benefit from any tax holidays associated with SEZs and certain other tax incentives, including MAT carryforwards, and may not reverse its election. Our current intent is to elect into the new tax regime once our MAT carryforwards are fully or substantially utilized. While our existing MAT carryforwards expire between March 2027 and March 2032, we expect to fully or substantially utilize our existing MAT carryforwards in or after the India financial year starting April 1, 2022. Our intent is based on a number of assumptions and financial projections. An election into the new tax law regime prior to utilization of our MAT carryforwards would result in a write-off of any remaining deferred income tax assets relating to the MAT carryforwards. As a result of the enactment of the India Tax Law, we recorded a one-time net income tax expense of $\n21\nmillion in 2019, due to the revaluation to the lower income tax rate of our India net deferred income tax assets that are expected to reverse after we expect to elect into the new tax regime.\nWe conduct business globally and file income tax returns in the United States, including federal and state, as well as various foreign jurisdictions. Tax years that remain subject to examination by the IRS are 2012 and onward, and years that remain subject to examination by state authorities vary by state. Years under examination by foreign tax authorities are 2001 and onward. In addition, transactions between our affiliated entities are arranged in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws, regulations and relevant guidelines. As a result, and due to the interpretive nature of certain aspects of these laws and guidelines, we have pending applications for APAs before the taxing authorities in some of our most significant jurisdictions.\nWe record incremental tax expense, based upon the more-likely-than-not standard, for any uncertain tax positions. In addition, when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded income tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled or otherwise resolved. Our ongoing evaluations of the more-likely-than-not outcomes of the examinations and related tax positions require judgment and can result in adjustments that increase or decrease our effective income tax rate, as well as impact our operating results. The specific timing of when the resolution of each tax position will be reached is uncertain.\nChanges in unrecognized income tax benefits were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nThe unrecognized income tax benefits would affect our effective income tax rate, if recognized. While the Company believes uncertain tax positions may be settled or resolved within the next twelve months, it is difficult to estimate the income tax impact of these potential resolutions at this time. We recognize accrued interest and any penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $\n22\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion, respectively, and relates to U.S. and foreign tax matters. The amounts of interest and penalties recorded in the provision for income taxes in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were\nimmaterial.\nF-31\nIn the normal course of business, we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Derivatives may give rise to credit risk from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to us.\nWe have limited our credit risk by limi\nting the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conducting ongoing evaluation of the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we do business. In addition, all the assets and liabilities related to our foreign exchange derivative contracts set forth in the below table are subject to master netting arrangements, such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement, with each individual counterparty. These master netting arrangements generally provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with the counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. We have presented all the assets and liabilities related to our foreign exchange derivative contracts, as applicable, on a gross basis, with no offsets, in our consolidated statements of financial position. There is no financial collateral (including cash collateral) posted or received by us related to our foreign exchange derivative contracts.\nThe following table provides information on the location and fair values of derivative financial instruments included in our consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31:\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe have entered into a series of foreign exchange derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar on future operating costs and are scheduled to mature each month during 2021 and 2022. The changes in fair value of these contracts are initially reported in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in our consolidated statements of financial position and are subsequently reclassified to earnings within the captions \"Cost of revenues\" and \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period th\nat the forecasted Indian rupee denominated payments are recorded in earnings. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate that $\n35\nmillion, net of tax, of the net gains relate\nd to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges reported in the caption \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in our consolidated statements of financial position is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.\nF-32\nThe notional value of our outstanding contracts by year of maturity and the net unrealized gains and losses included in the caption \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in our consolidated statements of financial position, for such contracts were as follows as of December 31:\n(1)\nIncludes $\n133\nmillion notional value of option contracts as of December 31, 2020, with the remaining notional value related to forward contracts.\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains on our cash flow hedges for the year ended December 31:\nThe activity related to the change in net unrealized gains and losses on our cash flow hedges included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in our consolidated statements of stockholders' equity is presented in\n.\nOther Derivatives\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to provide an economic hedge against balance sheet exposures to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries, primarily th\ne Indian rupee, the British Pound and the Euro.\nWe entered into foreign exchange forward contracts that are scheduled to mature in 2021. Realized gains or losses and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in the caption \"Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net\" on our consolidated statements of operations.\nAdditional information related to our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments was as follows as of December 31:\nF-33\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of realized and unrealized pre-tax (losses) gains on our other derivative financial instruments for the year ended December 31:\nThe related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.\nWe measure our cash equivalents, certain investments, contingent consideration liabilities and foreign exchange forward and option contracts at fair value. The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon their own market assumptions.\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:\n•\nLevel 1 – Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 – Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and market-corroborated inputs which are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.\n•\nLevel 3 – Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.\nThe following table summarizes our financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020:\n(1) Balance represents restricted time deposits. See\n.\nF-34\nThe following table summarizes our financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019:\n(1)\nIncludes $\n414\nmillion in restricted time deposits. See\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Level 3 contingent consideration liabilities:\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and measure the fair value of our equity security based on the published daily net asset value at which investors can freely subscribe to or redeem from the fund. The fair value of commercial paper is measured based on relevant trade data, dealer quotes, or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data, such as yield curves and credit spreads. The carrying value of the time deposits approximated fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model. This model calculates the difference between the current market forward price and the contracted forward price for each foreign exchange contract and applies the difference in the rates to each outstanding contract. The market forward rates include a discount and credit risk factor. We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange option contract by using a variant of the\nBlack-Scholes model. This model uses present value techniques and reflects the time value and intrinsic value based on\nobservable market rates.\nWe estimate the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities associated with our acquisitions using a variation of the income approach, which utilizes one or more significant inputs that are unobservable. This approach calculates the fair value of such liabilities based on the probability-weighted expected performance of the acquired entity against the target performance metric, discounted to present value when appropriate.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 there were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets and liabilities.\nF-35\nChanges in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" by component were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nF-36\nChanges in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" by component were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nF-37\nWe are involved in various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, we do not record a liability, but instead disclose the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Legal fees are expensed as incurred. While we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of any existing claims and proceedings (other than the specific matters described below, if decided adversely), individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, an unfavorable outcome in some or all of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future.\nOn January 15, 2015, Syntel sued TriZetto and Cognizant in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Syntel’s complaint alleged breach of contract against TriZetto, and tortious interference and misappropriation of trade secrets against Cognizant and TriZetto, stemming from Cognizant’s hiring of certain former Syntel employees. Cognizant and TriZetto countersued on March 23, 2015, for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and tortious interference, based on Syntel’s misuse of TriZetto confidential information and abandonment of contractual obligations. Cognizant and TriZetto subsequently added federal Defend Trade Secrets Act and copyright infringement claims for Syntel’s misuse of TriZetto’s proprietary technology. The parties’ claims were narrowed by the court and the case was tried before a jury, which on October 27, 2020 returned a verdict in favor of Cognizant in the amount of $\n854\nmillion, including $\n570\nmillion in punitive damages.\nWe expect Syntel to app\neal the decision and thus we will not record the gain in our financial statements until it becomes realizable.\nOn February 28, 2019, a ruling of the SCI interpreting the India Defined Contribution Obligation altered historical understandings of the obligation, extending it to cover additional portions of the employee’s income. As a result, the ongoing contributions of our affected employees and the Company were required to be increased. In the first quarter of 2019, we accrued $\n117\nmillion with respect to prior periods, assuming retroactive application of the Supreme Court’s ruling, in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated statement of operations. There is significant uncertainty as to how the liability should be calculated as it is impacted by multiple variables, including the period of assessment, the application with respect to certain current and former employees and whether interest and penalties may be assessed. Since the ruling, a variety of trade associations and industry groups have advocated to the Indian government, highlighting the harm to the information technology sector, other industries and job growth in India that would result from a retroactive application of the ruling. It is possible the Indian government will review the matter and there is a substantial question as to whether the Indian government will apply the SCI’s ruling on a retroactive basis. As such, the ultimate amount of our obligation may be materially different from the amount accrued.\nOn October 5, 2016, October 27, 2016 and November 18, 2016, three putative securities class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants. These complaints were consolidated into a single action and on April 7, 2017, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on behalf of a putative class of persons and entities who purchased our common stock during the period between February 27, 2015 and September 29, 2016, naming us and certain of our current and former officers as defendants and alleging violations of the Exchange Act, based on allegedly false or misleading statements related to potential violations of the FCPA, our business, prospects and operations, and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. The lead plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory damages, among other relief, and their reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on June 6, 2017. On August 8, 2018, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey issued an order which granted the motion to dismiss in part, including dismissal of all claims against current officers of the Company, and denied them in part. On September 7, 2018, we filed a motion in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to certify the August 8, 2018 order for immediate appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). On October 18, 2018, the District Court issued an order granting our motion, and staying the action pending the outcome of our appeal petition to the Third Circuit. On October 29, 2018, we filed a petition for permission to appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On March 6, 2019, the Third Circuit denied our petition without prejudice. In an order dated March 19, 2019, the District Court directed the lead plaintiffs to provide the defendants with a proposed amended complaint. On April 26, 2019, lead plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on June 10, 2019. On June 7, 2020, the District Court issued an order denying our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On July 10, 2020, we filed our answer to the second amended complaint. On July 23, 2020, the DOJ filed a motion on consent for leave to intervene and to stay all discovery through the conclusion of the criminal proceedings in United States v. Gordon J. Coburn and Steven Schwartz, Crim. No. 19-120 (KM), except for\nF-38\ndocuments produced by us to the DOJ in connection with those criminal proceedings. On July 24, 2020, the District Court granted the DOJ’s motion; and on that same day, we filed a motion in the District Court to certify the June 7, 2020 order for immediate appeal to the Third Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1292(b), which motion is now fully briefed.\nOn October 31, 2016, November 15, 2016 and November 18, 2016, three putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed in New Jersey Superior Court, Bergen County, naming us, all of our then current directors and certain of our current and former officers as defendants. These actions were consolidated in an order dated January 24, 2017. The complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, mismanagement, and/or insider selling by defendants. On March 16, 2017, the parties filed a stipulation deferring all further proceedings pending a final, non-appealable ruling on the then anticipated motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action. On April 26, 2017, in lieu of ordering the stipulation filed by the parties, the New Jersey Superior Court deferred further proceedings by dismissing the consolidated putative shareholder derivative litigation without prejudice but permitting the parties to file a motion to vacate the dismissal in the future.\nOn February 22, 2017, April 7, 2017 and May 10, 2017, three additional putative shareholder derivative complaints alleging similar claims were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, naming us and certain of our current and former directors and officers as defendants. These complaints asserted claims similar to those in the previously-filed putative shareholder derivative actions. In an order dated June 20, 2017, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey consolidated these actions into a single action, appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel, and stayed all further proceedings pending a final, non-appealable ruling on the motions to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action. On October 30, 2018, lead plaintiff filed a consolidated verified derivative complaint.\nOn March 11, 2019, a seventh putative shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, naming us, certain of our current and former directors, and certain of our current and former officers as defendants. The complaint in that action asserts claims similar to those in the previously-filed putative shareholder derivative actions. On May 14, 2019, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey approved a stipulation that (i) consolidated this action with the putative shareholder derivative suits that were previously filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; and (ii) stayed all of these suits pending order on the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in the securities class action. On August 3, 2020, lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\nWe are presently unable to predict the duration, scope or result of the consolidated putative securities class action, the putative shareholder derivative actions or any other lawsuits. As such, we are presently unable to develop a reasonable estimate of a possible loss or range of losses, if any, and thus have not recorded any accruals related to these matters. While the Company intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously, these lawsuits and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, the actual cost of such litigation will depend upon many unknown factors and the outcome of the litigation is necessarily uncertain.\nWe have indemnification and expense advancement obligations pursuant to our bylaws and indemnification agreements with respect to certain current and former members of senior management and the Company’s directors. In connection with the matters that were the subject of our previously disclosed internal investigation, the DOJ and SEC investigations and the related litigation, we have received and expect to continue to receive requests under such indemnification agreements and our bylaws to provide funds for legal fees and other expenses. We have expensed such costs incurred through December 31, 2020.\nWe have maintained directors and officers insurance and have recorded\nan insurance receivable of $\n7\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in \"Other current assets\" o\nn our consolidated statement of financial position related to the recovery of a portion of the indemnification expenses and costs related to the putative securities class action complaints. We are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period related to the indemnification and expense advancement obligations described here.\nSee\nfor information relating to the ITD Dispute.\nMany of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients’ business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a client’s systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a client’s confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover all types of claims, continue\nF-39\nto be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for a particular period.\nIn the normal course of business and in conjunction with certain client engagements, we have entered into contractual arrangements through which we may be obligated to indemnify clients or other parties with whom we conduct business with respect to certain matters. These arrangements can include provisions whereby we agree to hold the indemnified party and certain of their affiliated entities harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as our breach of certain representations or covenants, our intellectual property infringement, our gross negligence or willful misconduct or certain other claims made against certain parties. Payments by us under any of these arrangements are generally conditioned on the client making a claim and providing us with full control over the defense and settlement of such claim. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential liability under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, we have not made material payments under these indemnification agreements and therefore they have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. However, if events arise requiring us to make payment for indemnification claims under our indemnification obligations in contracts we have entered, such payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows for a particular period.\nWe contribute to defined contribution plans in the United States and Europe, including 401(k) savings and supplemental retirement plans in the United States. Total expenses for our contributions to these plans were $\n118\nmillion, $\n117\nmillion and $\n108\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe maintain employee benefit plans that cover substantially all India-based employees. The employees’ provident fund, pension and family pension plans are statutorily defined contribution retirement benefit plans. Under the plans, employees contribute up to\n12.0\n% of their eligible compensation, which is matched by an equal contribution by the Company. For these plans, we recognized a contribution expense of $\n98\nmillion, $\n101\nmillion and $\n88\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. On February 28, 2019, a ruling of the SCI altered historical understandings of the obligation under these plans, extending them to cover additional portions of the employee’s income. In the first quarter of 2019, we accrued $\n117\nmillion with respect to prior periods, assuming retroactive application of the SCI’s ruling, in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated statements of operations. See\nfor further information.\nWe also maintain a gratuity plan in India that is a statutory post-employment benefit plan providing defined lump sum benefits. We make annual contributions to the employees’ gratuity fund established with a government-owned insurance corporation to fund a portion of the estimated obligation. Accordingly, our liability for the gratuity plan reflected the undiscounted benefit obligation payable as of the balance sheet date, which was based upon the employees’ salary and years of service. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount accrued under the gratuity plan was $\n124\nmillion and $\n135\nmillion, which is net of fund assets of $\n186\nmillion and $\n160\nmillion, respectively\n. Expense\nrecognized by us was $\n35\nmillion, $\n38\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company's 2017 Incentive Plan and the Purchase Plan provide for the issuance of up to\n48.8\nmillion (plus any shares underlying outstanding awards that are forfeited under the 2009 Incentive Plan) and\n40.0\nmillion shares, respectively, of Class A common stock to eligible employees. The 2017 Incentive Plan does not affect any awards outstanding under the 2009 Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2020, we have\n28.8\nmillion and\n5.9\nmillion shares available for grant under the 2017 Incentive Plan and the Purchase Plan, respectively.\nThe allocation of total stock-based compensation expense between cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses as well as the related income tax benefit were as follows for the three years ended December 31:\nF-40\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units\nWe granted RSUs that vest proportionately in quarterly or annual installments ranging from\none year\nto\nfour years\nto employees, including our executive officers. Stock-based compensation expense relating to RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nA summary of the activity for RSUs granted under our stock-based compensation plans as of December 31, 2020 and changes during the year then ended is presented below:\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n61.85\n, $\n64.12\nand $\n74.94\n, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $\n247\nmillion of total remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to RSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of\n1.8\nyears.\nWe granted PSUs that vest over periods ranging from\none year\nto\nfour years\nto employees, including our executive officers. The vesting of PSUs is contingent on both meeting certain financial performance targets and continued service. A summary of the activity for PSUs granted under our stock-based compensation plans as of December 31, 2020 and changes during the year then ended is presented below.\nThe presentation reflects the number of PSUs at the maximum performance milestones.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of PSUs granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n62.00\n, $\n70.77\nand $\n81.98\n, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $\n34\nmillion of the total remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to PSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of\n2.0\nyears.\nAll RSUs and PSUs have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. Dividend equivalent rights are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs and PSUs and are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest.\nThe Purchase Plan\nThe Purchase Plan provides for eligible employees to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a price of\n90\n% of the lesser of: (a) the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the first date of the purchase period or (b) the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the last date of the purchase period. Stock-based compensation expense for the Purchase Plan is recognized over the vesting period of\nthree months\non a straight-line basis.\nF-41\nThe fair values of the options granted under the Purchase Plan, were estimated at the date of grant during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 based upon the following assumptions and were as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued\n3.0\nmillion shares of Class A common stock under the Purchase Plan with a total fair value of approximately $\n28\nmillion.\nIn 2018, we provided $\n100\nmillion of initial funding to the Cognizant U.S. Foundation. The expense was reported in the caption \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in our consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, two of our executive officers served as directors of the Cognizant U.S. Foundation in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOur reportable segments are:\n•\nFinancial Services, which consists of our banking and insurance operating segments;\n•\nHealthcare, which consists of our healthcare and life sciences operating segments;\n•\nProducts and Resources, which consists of our retail and consumer goods; manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities; and travel and hospitality operating segments; and\n•\nCommunications, Media and Technology, which includes our communications and media operating segment and our technology operating segment.\nOur client partners, account executives and client relationship managers are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating segments may affect revenues and operating expenses to differing degrees.\nExpenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs (including stock-based compensation expense) as well as a per employee charge for use of our global delivery centers and infrastructure. Certain SG&A expenses, the excess or shortfall of incentive-based compensation for commercial and delivery employees as compared to target, restructuring costs, COVID-19 Charges, costs related to the ransomware attack, a portion of depreciation and amortization and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit and are included below as “unallocated costs” and adjusted against our total income from operations.
