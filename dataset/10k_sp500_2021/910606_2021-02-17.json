    "text": "Regency Centers Corporation is a fully integrated real estate company and self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust that began its operations as a publicly-traded REIT in 1993.  Regency Centers L.P. is the entity through which Regency Centers Corporation conducts substantially all of its operations and owns substantially all of its assets.\nOur business consists of acquiring, developing, owning and operating income-producing retail real estate principally located in many of the top markets in the United States.  We generate revenues by leasing space to retail tenants such as highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers.\nRegency has been an S&P 500 Index member since 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had full or partial ownership interests in 411 properties, primarily anchored by market leading grocery stores, encompassing 51.9 million square feet (“SF”) of gross leasable area (“GLA”).  Our Pro-rata share of this GLA is 42.2 million square feet, including our share of the partially owned properties.\nOur mission is to be the preeminent national owner, operator, and developer of shopping centers, creating places that provide a thriving environment for outstanding retailers and service providers to connect with the surrounding neighborhoods and communities.\nOur goals are to:\n1\nKey strategies to achieve our goals are to:\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was declared a pandemic (“COVID-19 pandemic” or the “pandemic”) by the World Health Organization as the disease spread throughout the world.  The pandemic continues to evolve, making the broader implications on our future results of operations and overall financial performance uncertain at this time.  While much of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments, our tenants’ ability to meet their lease obligations has been negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of the pandemic.  Certain of our tenants’ ability to respond to these disruptions, including adapting to governmental orders, recommendations, and changes in their customers’ shopping habits and behaviors, could influence their ability to survive and ultimately fulfill their lease obligations.  While the announcement of vaccine approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in early December 2020 was a positive development, at about the same time, several states and many localities reinstituted mandatory business limitations and closures as infection rates increased, in advance of full scale vaccine deployment.  Forced closures may continue to occur as infection rates increase or additional strains of the virus emerge, while the speed of vaccine rollout remains uncertain.\nDue to the pandemic, certain tenants have requested rent concessions or have sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment.  Other tenants have chosen not to reopen or honor the terms of their existing lease agreements.  In addition, in 2020 we saw a meaningful increase in the number of bankruptcy filings by our tenants versus prior years, which in certain cases can lead to a tenant “rejecting” (terminating) one or more of our leases as permitted by applicable bankruptcy law, or seeking to negotiate reduced rent as part of the bankruptcy reorganization process.\nWe are closely monitoring our rent collections from our tenants, which significantly declined from historic levels at the start of the pandemic, but have since gradually improved.  As of February 8, 2021, we experienced sequential improvement in our collection rates of Pro-rata base rent billed by quarter in 2020 as follows:\nSince the pandemic began, we have executed approximately 1,600 rent deferral agreements within our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate portfolios.  The weighted average deferral period of these agreements is approximately 3.3 months, with repayment periods of approximately 9.7 months beginning on average in December 2020.  In some cases, we expect to continue to work with tenants to address the adverse impacts of the pandemic, which may result in further rent deferrals, concessions or abatements.  As a result, there can be no assurance that our future base rent collection percentages will continue at or above Q4 2020 levels, or that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to sustain and fund our dividend payments without the benefit of other sources of capital or changes to our current dividend levels.  In the event of a surge in COVID-19 cases or new governmental restrictions causing our tenants to reduce their operations or close, our base rent collection percentages and percent leased could decline from current levels.\nNew leasing activity declined in 2020 and is expected to remain below 2019 levels into 2021 as businesses delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts of the pandemic.  This, coupled with tenant failures and bankruptcies, may result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers, which could result in difficulty attracting new tenants resulting in pricing pressure on rents.  Additionally, if construction of tenant improvements are delayed due to the impacts of the pandemic, it may take longer before new tenants are able to open and commence rent payments.\nThe pandemic has significantly slowed and in certain situations delayed tenant buildouts, new ground up developments or redevelopment of existing properties.  The pandemic has also limited our ability to timely source materials for construction and has caused labor shortages, which have impacted our ability to complete construction projects on anticipated schedules.  In the event a surge in new cases resulting in additional lockdowns occurs, similar impacts to our supply chain may arise which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We continue to closely monitor our projects, which has resulted in prudently delaying, phasing or curtailing certain of our development, redevelopment and capital expenditure projects.\n2\nThe duration and severity of the\npandemic across\nthe United States will continue to\nnegatively impact\nmany of\nour\ntenants\nand\ntheir ability to meet their rent obligations under their lease agreements.\nAs such, the\npandemic\ncould\ncontinue to\nnegatively impact our\nr\nesults of operations and overall financial\ncondition in the future\n.\nSee also Part I\n, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors for further discussion.\nOur business continuity and disaster recovery plan enabled us to continue operating productively during the pandemic.  We have maintained, and expect to continue to maintain, without interruption, our financial reporting systems as well as our internal controls over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nCompetition\nWe are among the largest owners of shopping centers in the nation based on revenues, number of properties, GLA, and market capitalization.  There are numerous companies and individuals engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition, and operation of shopping centers that compete with us in our targeted markets, including grocery store chains that also anchor some of our shopping centers.  This results in competition for attracting tenants, as well as the acquisition of existing shopping centers and new development sites.  In addition, brick and mortar shopping centers, in general, face continued competition from alternative shopping and delivery methods, including e-commerce and home delivery.  We believe that our competitive advantages are driven by:\nCorporate Responsibility\nOur vision is to be the preeminent national owner, operator and developer of shopping centers, connecting outstanding retailers and service providers with their neighborhoods and communities while striving to achieve best-in-class corporate responsibility.  To integrate corporate responsibility into our vision, we focus on three key overarching concepts: long-term value creation, our Regency brand and reputation, and the importance of maintaining our culture.\nWe have established four pillars for our corporate responsibility program that we believe enable us to support our vision and implement these concepts:\nOur People\n– Our people are our most important asset and we strive to ensure that they are engaged, passionate about their work, connected to their teams, and supported to deliver their best performance.  We recognize and value the importance of attracting and retaining talented individuals to Regency’s performance and growth.  We strive to maintain a safe and healthy workspace, promote employee well-being, and empower our employees by focusing on their training and education.  Another key element of our focus on people is our understanding and appreciation of the value of an inclusive and diverse workforce.  In 2020, we began developing and implementing a comprehensive three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) strategy, which includes training, recruitment, and engagement.  Our employees have been directly engaged in the development of our DEI strategy to ensure they are connected to and actively involved in its implementation across the entirety of our business.\nOur Communities\n– Our predominately grocery-anchored neighborhood centers provide many benefits to the communities in which we live and work, including significant local economic impacts in the form of investment, jobs and taxes.  Our local teams are also passionate about investing in and engaging with our communities, as they customize and cultivate our centers to create a distinctive environment to bring our tenants and shoppers together for the best retail experience.  Further, philanthropy and giving back are cornerstones of what we do and who Regency is.  In addition, charitable contributions are made directly by the Company, and the vast majority of our employees donate their time and money to local non-profits serving their communities.\n3\nEthics and Governance\n–\nAs\nlong-term\nstewards of our investors’ capital, we are committed to best-in-class corporate governance.\nTo create long-term value for our stakeholders, w\ne place great emphasis on\nour culture and core values, the\nintegrity and transparency\nof our reporting practices\n,\nand our overall governance structure\nin respect of oversight and shareholder rights\n.\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n– We believe sustainability is in the best interest of our investors, tenants, employees, and the communities in which we operate, and we strive to integrate sustainable practices throughout our business.  We have six strategic priorities when it comes to identifying and implementing sustainable business practices and minimizing our environmental impact: green building, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, water conservation, waste minimization and management, and climate resilience.  We believe these commitments are not only the right thing to do to address material environmental topics such as air pollution, climate change, and resource scarcity, but also support us in achieving key strategic objectives in our operations and development projects.\nMore information about our corporate responsibility strategy, goals, performance, and reporting is available on our website at www.regencycenters.com.  The content of our website, including information relating to corporate responsibility, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nEmployees\nOur corporate headquarters are located at One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida.  We presently maintain 22 market offices nationwide, including our corporate headquarters, where we conduct management, leasing, construction, and investment activities.  We have 431 employees throughout the United States and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.\nCompliance with Governmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various regulatory and tax-related requirements within the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Changes to such requirements may result in unanticipated financial impacts or adverse tax consequences, and could affect our operating results and financial condition.  Significant regulatory requirements include the laws and regulations described below.\nREIT Laws and Regulations\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the federal income tax laws. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Under the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), REITs are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90% of taxable income each year. We will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income. We will also generally not qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Even if we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.\nWe have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”). In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes which, to date, have not been material to us.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be liable for the cost to assess and remediate certain hazardous substances at our shopping centers that generally arise from dry cleaners, gas stations, asbestos, and historic land use practices.  These requirements often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or committed the acts or omissions that caused, the presence of the hazardous substances.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly address contamination caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  Although we have a number of properties that could require or are currently undergoing varying levels of assessment and remediation, known environmental liabilities are not currently expected to have a material financial impact.\n4\nExecutive Officers\nOur executive officers are appointed each year by our Board of Directors.  Each of our executive officers has been employed by us for more than five years and, as of December 31, 2020, included the following:\nCompany Website Access and SEC Filings\nOur website may be accessed at\nwww.regencycenters.com\n.  All of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) can be accessed free of charge through our website promptly after filing; however, in the event that the website is inaccessible, we will provide paper copies of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, the most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, current reports filed or furnished on Form 8-K, and all related amendments, excluding exhibits, free of charge upon request.  These filings are also accessible on the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov\n.  The content of our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nGeneral Information\nOur registrar and stock transfer agent is Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. (“Broadridge”), Philadelphia, PA.  We offer a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) that enables our shareholders to reinvest dividends automatically, as well as to make voluntary cash payments toward the purchase of additional shares.  For more information, contact Broadridge toll free at (855) 449-0975 or our Shareholder Relations Department at (904) 598-7000.\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and trades under the stock symbol “REG”.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is KPMG LLP, Jacksonville, Florida.  Our legal counsel is Foley & Lardner LLP, Jacksonville, Florida.\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders\nOur 2021 annual meeting of shareholders is currently expected to be held on Wednesday, May 5, 2021.  In light of public health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to help protect the safety of our shareholders, directors, employees, and other participants, the Company’s annual meeting will be conducted in a virtual-only format.\nDefined Terms\nIn addition to the required Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) presentations, we use certain non-GAAP performance measures as we believe these measures improve the understanding of the Company's operational results.  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning\n5\npurposes.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.\nWe do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company.\nThe following terms, as defined, are commonly used by management and the investing public to understand and evaluate our operational results:\nCompanies use different depreciable lives and methods, and real estate values historically fluctuate with market conditions.  Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sale and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs.  This provides a perspective of our financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations.  We provide a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to Nareit FFO.\n6\nWe provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of assets, liabilities, operating results, and other metrics, along with certain other non-GAAP measures, makes comparisons of other REITs’ operating results to ours more meaningful.  The Pro-rata information provided is not, nor is it intended to be, presented in accordance with GAAP.  The Pro-rata supplemental details of assets and liabilities and supplemental details of operations reflect our proportionate economic ownership of the assets, liabilities, and operating results of the properties in our portfolio\nThe Pro-rata information is prepared on a basis consistent with the comparable consolidated amounts and is intended to more accurately reflect our proportionate economic interest in the assets, liabilities, and operating results of properties in our portfolio.  We do not control the unconsolidated investment partnerships, and the Pro-rata presentations of the assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses do not represent our legal claim to such items.  The partners are entitled to profit or loss allocations and distributions of cash flows according to the operating agreements, which generally provide for such allocations according to their invested capital.  Our share of invested capital establishes the ownership interests we use to prepare our Pro-rata share.\nThe presentation of Pro-rata information has limitations which include, but are not limited to, the following:\nBecause of these limitations, the Pro-rata financial information should not be considered independently or as a substitute for our financial statements as reported under GAAP.  We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements, using the Pro-rata information as a supplement.\n7"

    "text": "Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those listed below.  When considering an investment in our securities, carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our other filings and submissions to the SEC, which provide much more information and detail.  If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition and/ or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nPandemics or other health crises, such as the pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nDuring the ongoing pandemic, U.S. federal, state, and local governments have continued to mandate or recommend various actions to reduce or prevent the spread of COVID-19 which continues to directly impact many of our tenants, and in particular those whose businesses may be considered non-essential.  Grocery stores, which anchor over 80% of our operating centers, have generally been able to continue operating and serving their customers. However, non-essential businesses such as dine-in restaurants, fitness facilities and movie theaters in many states continue to experience significant declines in customer traffic when compared to previous years, or have temporarily closed their locations (in some cases multiple times) in response to governmental orders or voluntary efforts to support social distancing.\nDue to the pandemic, certain tenants have requested rent concessions or have sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment.  Other tenants have chosen not to reopen or honor the terms of their existing lease agreements.  In addition, moratoria and other temporary legal restrictions in certain states on our ability to bring legal action to enforce our leases have impacted our ability to collect rent and may continue to do so into 2021.\nNew leasing activity has declined and is expected to remain at lower levels than pre-pandemic into 2021 as businesses delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts of the pandemic. This, coupled with tenant failures, may result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers, which could result in downward pressure on rents.  Additionally, due to delays in construction of tenant improvements due to the impacts of the pandemic, it may take longer before new tenants are able to open and commence rent payments.\nThe pandemic has adversely impacted our ability to start or complete tenant buildouts, new ground up development and redevelopment of existing properties.  The pandemic has also impacted our ability to timely source materials for construction and caused labor shortages, which have impacted our ability to complete construction projects on anticipated schedules.  New or extended government orders to combat the further spread of the virus could result in similar impacts to our development and redevelopment projects and supply chain, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe full impacts of the pandemic on our future results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain.  While the vast majority of our lease income is derived from contractual rent payments, the ability of certain of our tenants to meet their lease obligations have been negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of the pandemic. Our tenants’ ability to respond to these disruptions and uncertainties, including adjusting to governmental orders and changes in their customers’ shopping habits and behaviors, will impact their businesses’ ability to survive, and ultimately, their ability to comply with their lease obligations.  The risk of diminished sales and future closures exists so long as the virus remains active and continues to spread. Ultimately, t\nhe duration and severity of the health crisis in the United States and the speed at which the country, states and localities are able to safely reopen and remain open, will continue to materially impact the overall economy, our retail tenants, and therefore our results of operations\n, financial condition and cash flows. Until the virus is contained or eradicated, or effective and reliable treatments and/or vaccines are widely available and accepted by the public, commerce and employment may not return to pre-pandemic levels and we may experience material reductions in our cash flows, NOI and financial performance compared to pre-pandemic periods.\n8\nRisk Factors Related to\nOperating Retail-Based Shopping Centers\nEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses.\nOur properties are leased primarily to retail tenants from whom we derive most of our revenue in the form of base rent, expense recoveries and other income.  Therefore, our performance and operating results are directly linked to the economic and market conditions occurring in the retail industry.  We are subject to the risks that, upon expiration, leases for space in our properties are not renewed by existing tenants, vacant space is not leased to new tenants, and/or tenants demand modified lease terms, including costs for renovations or concessions.  Moreover, pandemics, such as the pandemic, may exacerbate the effects of these risks.  The economic and market conditions potentially affecting the retail industry and our properties specifically include the following:\nTo the extent that any or a combination of these conditions occur they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the demand and market rents for retail space, the percent leased levels of our properties, our ability to sell, acquire or develop properties, our operating results and our cash available for distributions to stock and unit holders.\nShifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows.\nRetailers are increasingly impacted by e-commerce and changes in customer buying habits, including the delivery or curbside pick-up of items ordered online.  The pandemic has likely accelerated these trends and their potential impacts.  Retailers are considering these e-commerce trends when making decisions regarding their bricks and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing retail environment.  Many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods, which have historically been less likely to be purchased online; however, the continuing increase in e-commerce sales in all retail categories may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of their retail locations in the future or close stores.  Our grocer tenants are incorporating e-commerce concepts through home delivery and curbside pick-up, which could reduce foot traffic at our centers.  In certain higher-income markets, foot traffic at our centers may be impacted more meaningfully by these alternative delivery methods if consumers are willing to pay premiums for such services.  Changes in shopping trends as a result of the growth in e-commerce may also impact the profitability of retailers that do not adapt to changes in market conditions, including their financial condition and ability to pay rent.  This shift may adversely impact our percent leased and rental rates, which would impact our results of operations and cash flows.\n9\nChanging economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow.\nEconomic conditions in markets where our properties are concentrated can greatly influence our financial performance.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, our properties in California, Florida, Texas, New York and Georgia accounted for 27.2%, 22.1%, 7.5%, 5.2%, and 5.1% respectively, of our NOI from Consolidated Properties plus our Pro-rata share from Unconsolidated Properties.  Our revenues and cash flow may be adversely affected by this geographic concentration if market conditions, such as supply of or demand for retail space, deteriorate more significantly in these states compared to other geographic areas.  For example, with respect to the pandemic, California has imposed very stringent restrictions on re-opening and has implemented stringent eviction moratoria, making it more difficult in certain circumstances to collect rent and enforce our leases.  Additionally, there is a risk that many businesses and residents in major metropolitan cities may desire to relocate to different states or suburban markets as a result of the pandemic, following the impact of state regulations on businesses and residents coupled with the shift to remote work.\nOur success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants.\n“Anchor Tenants” (tenants occupying 10,000 square feet or more) operate large stores in our shopping centers, pay a significant portion of the total rent at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by attracting shoppers to the property.  Our net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by the loss of revenues and incurrence of additional costs in the event a significant Anchor Tenant:\nSome anchors have the right to vacate their space and may prevent us from re-tenanting by continuing to comply and pay rent in accordance with their lease agreement.  Vacated anchor space, including space that may be owned by the anchor (as discussed below), can reduce rental revenues generated by the shopping center in other spaces because of the loss of the departed anchor's customer drawing power.  In addition, if a significant tenant vacates a property, co-tenancy clauses in select lease contracts may allow other tenants to modify or terminate their rent or lease obligations.  Co-tenancy clauses have several variants: they may allow a tenant to postpone a store opening if certain other tenants fail to open their stores; they may allow a tenant to close its store prior to lease expiration if another tenant closes its store prior to lease expiration; or more commonly, they may allow a tenant to pay reduced levels of rent until a certain number of tenants open their stores within the same shopping center.\nAdditionally, some of our shopping centers are anchored by retailers who own their space whose location is within or immediately adjacent to our shopping center (“shadow anchors”).  In those cases, the shadow anchors appear to the consumer as a retail tenant of the shopping center and, as a result, attract additional consumer traffic to the center.  In the event that a shadow anchor were to close, it could negatively impact our center as consumer traffic would likely be reduced.\nA significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful.\nAt December 31, 2020, tenants occupying less than 10,000 square feet (“Shop Space Tenants”) represent approximately 35.6% of our GLA, with approximately 14.3% of those considered local tenants.  These tenants may be more vulnerable to negative economic conditions, including the impacts from pandemics, as they may have more limited resources and access to capital than Anchor Tenants.  Shop Space Tenants may be facing reduced sales as a result of an increase in competition including from e-commerce retailers.  The types of Shop Space Tenants vary from retail shops and restaurants to service providers.  If we are unable to attract the right type or mix of Shop Space Tenants into our centers, our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted.\nDuring times of economic downturns or uncertainties, including during pandemics such as COVID-19, some tenants may suffer disproportionally greater impacts and be at greater risk of default on their lease obligations or request lease concessions from us.  If we are unable to attract the right type or mix of low or non-credit tenants into our centers, our revenues and cash flow may be adversely impacted.\n10\nWe may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy.\nAlthough lease income is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file for bankruptcy have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  Moreover, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we saw meaningfully higher levels of tenant bankruptcies than in recent years as a result of the pandemic, and we expect this trend to continue into at least the first half of 2021.  Additionally, we may incur significant expense to recover our claim and to re-lease the vacated space. In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files for bankruptcy and rejects its leases, we may experience a significant reduction in our revenues and may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by the bankrupt tenant.\nMany of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases.\nCertain costs and expenses associated with our operating our properties, such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and common area expenses, generally do not decrease in the event of reduced occupancy or rental rates, non-payment of rents by tenants, general economic downturns, pandemics or other similar circumstances. In fact, in some cases, such as real estate taxes and insurance, they may actually increase despite such events. As such, we may not be able to lower the operating expenses of our properties sufficiently to fully offset such circumstances, and may not be able to fully recoup these costs from our tenants. In such cases, our cash flows, operating results and financial performance may be adversely impacted.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may have a negative effect on us.\nAll of our properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with ADA requirements may require removal of access barriers, and noncompliance may result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. While the tenants to whom we lease space in our properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and typically under tenant leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance, if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these tenants to cover costs may be adversely affected. In addition, we are required to operate the properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental entities and become applicable to the properties. Costs to be in compliance with the ADA or any other building regulations could be material and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to Real Estate Investments\nOur real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income.\nOur real estate properties are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  We evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, such that the value of the real estate properties (including any related tangible or intangible assets or liabilities, including goodwill) may not be recoverable.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated holding periods, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and may differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the holding period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss may be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.\nThe fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through the use of comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections take into account expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other relevant criteria, and therefore are subject to management judgment.  The impacts of the pandemic to future income, trends and prospects is uncertain and continues to evolve, therefore any assumptions impacting real estate values may be subject to change in the future, which may impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.\nThese subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income, which may be material.  There can be no assurance that we will not record impairment charges in the future related to our assets.\n11\nWe face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.\nWe actively pursue opportunities for new retail development and existing property redevelopment or expansion.  Development and redevelopment activities require various government and other approvals for entitlements and any delay in such approvals may significantly delay development and redevelopment projects.  We may not recover our investment in our projects for which approvals are not received, and delays may adversely impact our expected returns.  Additionally, changes in political elections and policies may impact our ability to obtain favorable land use and zoning for in-process and future developments and redevelopment projects.  We are subject to other risks associated with these activities, including the following:\nWe face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.\nWe have expanded our investment focus to include a limited number of more complex acquisitions and mixed-use development and redevelopment projects in dense urban locations, which pose unique risks to our return on investment.  Mixed-use projects refer to real estate projects that, in addition to retail space, may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes.  We have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do retail real estate.  As a result, if a development or redevelopment project includes a non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer, or partner with a developer.\nIn addition, redevelopment of existing shopping centers into mixed-use projects generally includes tenant vacancies before and during the redevelopment, which could result in volatility in NOI.\n12\nWe face risks associated with the acquisition of properties.\nOur investment strategy includes investing in high-quality shopping centers that are leased to market-leading grocers, category-leading anchors, specialty retailers, or restaurants located in areas with high barriers to entry and above average household incomes and population densities.  The acquisition of properties and/or real estate entities entails risks that include, but are not limited to, the following, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows:\nWe may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions.\nOur properties, including their related tangible and intangible assets, represent the majority of our total consolidated assets and they may not be readily convertible to cash.  Moreover, pandemics such as COVID-19 may impact our ability to sell properties on our preferred timing and at prices and returns we deem acceptable.  As a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties, including properties held in joint ventures, in response to changes in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited.  The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control.  There may be less demand for lower quality properties that we have identified for ultimate disposition in markets with uncertain economic or retail environments, and where buyers are more reliant on the availability of third party mortgage financing.  If we want to sell a property, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or even exceed the carrying value of our investment.\nChanges in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.\nCertain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a taxable gain on sale.  We intend to utilize Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 like-kind exchanges to mitigate taxable income; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions or that changes to the tax laws do not eliminate or significantly change 1031 exchanges.  In the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments.\nRisk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our Properties\nClimate change may adversely impact our properties directly, and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees.\nWe cannot reliably predict the extent, rate, or impact of climate change.  To the extent climate change causes adverse changes in weather patterns, our properties in certain markets, especially those nearer to the coasts, may experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea‑levels.  Further, population migration may occur in response to these or other factors and negatively impact our centers. Climate and other environmental changes may result in volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate certain properties at all.  Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of insurance, or making insurance unavailable.  Moreover, while the federal government has not yet enacted comprehensive legislation to address climate change, certain states in which we own and operate shopping centers, including California and New York, have done so.  Compliance with these and future new laws or regulations related to climate change may require us to make improvements to our existing properties, resulting in increased capital expenditures, or pay additional taxes and fees assessed on us or our properties.  Although we strive to identify, analyze, and respond to the risk and opportunities that climate change presents, at this time, there can be no assurance that climate change will not have an adverse effect on the value of our properties and our financial performance.\n13\nGeographic concentration of our properties makes our business\nmore\nvulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather\nconditions and climate change.\nA significant number of our properties are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, sea-level rise due to climate change, and other natural disasters.  At December 31, 2020, 22% of the GLA of our portfolio is located in the state of California, including a number of properties in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles areas.  Additionally, 23% and 8% of the GLA of our portfolio is located in the states of Florida and Texas, respectively.  Insurance costs for properties in these areas have increased, and recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to increase significantly in the future.  We recognize that the frequency and / or intensity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase.  These weather conditions may disrupt our business and the business of our tenants, which may affect the ability of some tenants to pay rent and may reduce the willingness of tenants or residents to remain in or move to these affected areas.  Therefore, as a result of the geographic concentration of our properties, we face risks, including disruptions to our business and the businesses of our tenants and higher costs, such as uninsured property losses, higher insurance premiums, and potential additional regulatory requirements by government agencies in response to perceived risks.\nCosts of environmental remediation may impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.\nUnder various federal, state, and local laws, an owner or manager of real property may be liable for the costs to assess and remediate the presence of hazardous substances on the property, which in our case generally arise from former dry cleaners, gas stations, asbestos usage, and historic land use practices.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances.  The presence of, or the failure to properly address the presence of, hazardous substances may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or borrow using the property as collateral.  We can provide no assurance that we are aware of all potential environmental liabilities or their ultimate cost to address; that our properties will not be affected by tenants or nearby properties or other unrelated third parties; and that future uses or conditions, or changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their interpretation, will not result in additional material environmental liabilities to us.\nRisk Factors Related to Corporate Matters\nAn uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties.\nWe carry comprehensive liability, fire, flood, terrorism, business interruption, and environmental insurance for our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties.  Some types of losses, such as losses from named windstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, or wars may have more limited coverage, or in some cases, can be excluded from insurance coverage.  In addition, it is possible that the availability of insurance coverage in certain areas may decrease in the future, and the cost to procure such insurance may increase due to factors beyond our control.  We may reduce the insurance we procure as a result of the foregoing or other factors.  While we believe our coverage is appropriate and adequate to cover our insurable risks, should a loss occur at any of our properties that is in excess of the property or casualty insurance limits of our policies, we may lose part or all of our invested capital and revenues from such property, which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.\nTerrorist activities or violence occurring at our properties also may directly affect the value of our properties through damage, destruction or loss.  Insurance for such acts may be unavailable or cost more resulting in an increase to our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.  To the extent that our tenants are affected by such attacks and threats of attacks, their businesses may be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to meet obligations under their existing leases.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, and our ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees may significantly impact our future performance.  Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be assured that we will retain all of our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future.  Losing any one or more of these persons may have an adverse effect on us.\n14\nThe unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.\nMany of our information technology systems (including those we use for administration, accounting, and communications, as well as the systems of our co-investment partners and other third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers) contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our tenants and employees.  Many of our information technology systems also contain our proprietary information and other confidential information related to our business.  We are frequently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems.  To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of tenants’ or employees' data or our confidential information stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, such a breach may damage our reputation and cause us to lose tenants and revenues, incur third party claims and cause disruption to our business and plans.  Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability, and we may not be able to recover these expenses from our service providers, responsible parties, or insurance carriers.  Despite the ongoing significant investments in technology and training we make in cybersecurity, we can provide no assurance that we will avoid or prevent such breaches or attacks.\nAdditionally, federal, state and local authorities continue to develop laws to address data privacy protection.  Monitoring such changes, and taking steps to comply, involves significant costs and effort by management, which may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nDespite the implementation of security measures for our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, our systems are vulnerable to damages from multiple sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication failure.  Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business and cause us to incur additional costs to remedy such damages.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint Ventures\nWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued.\nWe have invested substantial capital as a partner in a number of partnerships and joint ventures to acquire, own, lease, develop or redevelop properties.  These activities are subject to the same risks as our investments in our wholly-owned properties.  These investments, and other future similar investments may involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions.  Partners or other owners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.\nThese investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale or financing, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture.  Disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that may increase our expenses and prevent management from focusing their time and efforts on our business.  Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. In addition, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners.  These factors may limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates.\nThe termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.\nIf partnerships owning a significant number of properties were dissolved for any reason, we could lose the asset, property management, leasing and construction management fees from these partnerships as well as the operating income of the properties, which may adversely affect our operating results and our cash available for distribution to stock and unit holders.  Certain of our partnership operating agreements provide either member the ability to elect buy/sell clauses.  The election of these dissolution provisions could require us to invest additional capital to acquire the partners’ interest or to sell our share of the property thereby losing the operating income and cash flow.\n15\nRisk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital Structure\nOur ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings.\nAs part of our funding strategy, we sell operating properties that no longer meet our investment standards or those with a limited future growth profile.  These sales proceeds are used to fund debt repayment, acquisition of operating properties, and the construction of new developments and redevelopments.  An increase in market capitalization rates or a decline in NOI may cause a reduction in the value of centers identified for sale, which would have an adverse impact on the amount of cash generated.  Additionally, the sale of properties resulting in significant tax gains may require higher distributions to our stockholders or payment of additional income taxes in order to maintain our REIT status.\nWe depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nTo qualify as a REIT, the Parent Company must, among other things, distribute to its stockholders each year at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding any net capital gains).  Because of these distribution requirements, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations.  In such instances, we would rely on third-party sources of capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings.  Our access to debt depends on our credit rating, the willingness of creditors to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets.  In addition to finding creditors willing to lend to us, we are dependent upon our joint venture partners to contribute their pro rata share of any amount needed to repay or refinance existing debt when lenders reduce the amount of debt our partnerships and joint ventures are eligible to refinance.\nIn addition, our existing debt arrangements also impose covenants that limit our flexibility in obtaining other financing.  Additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders' interests and additional debt financing may substantially increase our degree of leverage.\nWithout access to external sources of capital, we would be required to pay outstanding debt with our operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales.  Our operating cash flows may not be sufficient to pay our outstanding debt as it comes due and real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly at a return we believe is appropriate.  If we are required to deleverage our business with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales, we may be forced to reduce the amount of, or eliminate altogether, our distributions to stock and unit holders or refrain from making investments in our business.\nOur debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we do not expect to generate sufficient operating cash flow to make balloon principal payments on our debt when due.  If we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we may be forced (i) to dispose of properties, which might result in losses, or (ii) to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may reduce the cash flow available for distributions to stock and unit holders.  If we cannot make required mortgage payments, the mortgagee may foreclose on the property securing the mortgage.\nCovenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur unsecured notes, unsecured term loans, and unsecured line of credit (the “Line”) contain customary covenants, including compliance with financial ratios, such as ratio of indebtedness to total asset value and fixed charge coverage ratio.  These covenants may limit our operational flexibility and our investment activities.  Moreover, if we breach any of the covenants in our debt agreements, and do not cure the breach within the applicable cure period, our lenders may require us to repay the debt immediately, even in the absence of a payment default.  Many of our debt arrangements, including our unsecured notes, unsecured term loan, and unsecured line of credit are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other material debt obligations.  As a result, any default under our debt covenants may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations, and the market value of our stock.\n16\nIncreases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations.\nAlthough a significant amount of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, we do borrow funds at variable interest rates under our credit facility, term loan, and certain secured borrowings.  As of December 31, 2020, less than 1.0% of our outstanding debt was variable rate debt not hedged to fixed rate debt.  Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on any variable rate debt to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition, increases in interest rates will affect the terms under which we refinance our existing debt as it matures, to the extent we have not hedged our exposure to changes in interest rates.  This would reduce our future earnings and cash flows, which may adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also may reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our stock and unit holders.\nHedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.\nWe manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements.  These arrangements involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, and that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes.  There can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will qualify for hedge accounting or that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations.  Should we desire to terminate a hedging arrangement, there may be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our obligations under the hedging arrangement.  In addition, failure to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe interest rates on our Unsecured Credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which LIBOR or its replacement rate is determined.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) that regulates the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021.  As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts.  We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets.  Any changes adopted by FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR.  If that were to occur, our interest payments could change.  In addition, uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.\nWe have contracts that are indexed to LIBOR, including our $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and fifteen mortgages within our consolidated and unconsolidated portfolios totaling $225.5 million on a Pro-rata basis, as well as interest rate swaps to fix these variable cash flows with notional amounts totaling $177.0 million on a Pro-rata basis.  These LIBOR based instruments mature between 2020 and 2028.  We are monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans or amounts received and paid on derivative instruments.  These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur.  The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued.  For some instruments, the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging, as they may require negotiation with the respective counterparty.\nIf a contract is not transitioned to an alternative rate and LIBOR is discontinued, the impact is likely to vary by contract.  If LIBOR is discontinued or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and related interest rate swaps may be adversely affected.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form through June 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become nonrepresentative prior to that point.  This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator.  In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified.\n17\nRisk Factors Related to\nt\nhe Market Price for Our Securities\nChanges in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nThe market price of our debt and equity securities may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, many of which are out of our control, including:\nThese factors may cause the market price of our securities to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.  It is impossible to ensure that the market price of our securities, including our common stock, will not fall in the future.  A decrease in the market price of our common stock may reduce our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets.  Selling common stock at a decreased market price would have a dilutive impact on existing stockholders.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.\nOur ability to continue to pay dividends at historical rates or to increase our dividend rate will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:\nIf we do not maintain or periodically increase the dividend on our common stock, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and other securities.\n18\nRisk Factors Relating to the Company’s Qualification as a REIT\nIf the Parent Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.\nWe believe that the Parent Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and we plan to operate so that we can continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT.  If the Parent Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders.  Many REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.  The determination that the Parent Company is a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances, some of which may not be totally within our control and some of which involve questions of interpretation. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from specific passive sources, like rent, that are itemized in the REIT tax laws.  There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or a court would agree with the positions we have taken in interpreting the REIT requirements.  We are also required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains.  We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.  The fact that we hold many of our assets through co-investment partnerships and their subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements.  Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings, that make it more difficult for the Parent Company to remain qualified as a REIT.\nAlso, unless the IRS granted relief under certain statutory provisions, the Parent Company would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year it first failed to qualify.  If the Parent Company failed to qualify as a REIT (currently and/or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we would have to pay significant income taxes, reducing cash available to pay dividends, which would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, we would no longer be required to pay any dividends to stockholders in order to maintain our REIT status.  Although we believe that the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT, we cannot be assured that the Parent Company will continue to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes.\nEven if the Parent Company qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we are required to pay certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and property.  For example, if we have net income from “prohibited transactions,” that income will be subject to a 100% tax.  In general, prohibited transactions include sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.  The determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale.  While we have undertaken a significant number of asset sales in recent years, we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not contend otherwise.\nNew legislation, as well as new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions may be introduced, enacted, or promulgated from time to time, that may change the tax laws or interpretations of the tax laws regarding qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification, in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders.\nDividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates.\nSubject to limited exceptions, dividends paid by REITs (other than distributions designated as capital gain dividends, qualified dividends or returns of capital) are not eligible for reduced rates for qualified dividends paid by “C” corporations and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates.  The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which may adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the shares of our capital stock.\nCertain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT.\nA foreign person disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition.  This tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is “domestically controlled.”  In general, we will be a domestically controlled REIT if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of our stock, less than 50% in value of our stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons.  If we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of our common stock would be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless our common stock was traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specified testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock.\n19\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us.\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, may adversely affect Regency or our investors.  We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect Regency or our investors.  New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us.  There is also a risk that REIT status may be adversely impacted by a change in tax or other laws.  Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, may change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.  Generally, income from a hedging transaction that constitutes “qualifying income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests applicable to REITs, does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests, provided that we properly identify the hedging transaction pursuant to the applicable sections of the Code and Treasury Regulations.  To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to make the proper tax identifications, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests.  As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of otherwise advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).\nRisks Related to the Company’s Common Stock\nRestrictions on the ownership of the Parent Company’s capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control.\nOwnership of more than 7% by value of our outstanding capital stock is prohibited, with certain exceptions, by the Parent Company's articles of incorporation, for the purpose of maintaining its qualification as a REIT.  This 7% limitation may discourage a change in control and may also (i) deter tender offers for our capital stock, which offers may be attractive to our stockholders, or (ii) limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their capital stock that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block in excess of 7% of our outstanding capital stock or to affect a change in control.\nThe issuance of the Parent Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control.\nThe Parent Company's articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 30,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 10,000,000 shares of special common stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any shares issued. The issuance of preferred stock or special common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. The provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act regarding affiliated transactions may also deter potential acquisitions by preventing the acquiring party from consummating a merger or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of our disinterested stockholders.\nOwnership in the Parent Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, a stockholder’s percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or other corporate purposes, including equity awards we will grant to our directors, officers and employees. In the past we have issued equity in the secondary market and may do so again in the future, depending on the price of our stock and other factors.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock."

Many of the leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration.  Our leases typically provide for the payment of fixed base rent, the tenant’s Pro-rata share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (“CAM”) expenses, and reimbursement for utility costs if not directly metered.\n23\nThe following table summarizes\nPro-rata\nlease expirations for the next ten years and thereafter, for our Consolidated and Unconsolidated Properties, assuming no tenants renew their leases (GLA and dollars in thousands):\nDuring 2021, we have a total of 1,086 leases expiring, representing 2.9 million square feet of GLA.  These expiring leases have an average base rent of $25.24 PSF.  The average base rent of new leases signed during 2020 was $26.22 PSF.  During periods of economic weakness or when percent leased is low, tenants have more bargaining power, which may result in rental rate declines on new or renewal leases.  In periods of recovery and/or when percent leased levels are high, landlords have more bargaining power, which generally results in rental rate growth on new and renewal leases.  As a result of the pandemic, new leasing activity has declined as many businesses delay executing leases amidst its immediate and uncertain future economic impacts.  This trend, coupled with additional potential retail failures resulting from the pandemic, may result in decreased demand for retail space in our centers, which could result in downward pressure on rents.\n24\nThe following table lists information about\nour Consolidated and Unconsolidated Properties\n.  For further information\n, see Item 7, Manag\nement's Discussion and Analysis.\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35"

    "text": "COVID-19 Pandemic\nFor a discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I Item 1. Business.\nExecuting on our Strategy\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we had Net income attributable to common stockholders of $44.9 million, which includes the impacts of a $132.1 million Goodwill impairment charge and $117.0 million of uncollectible Lease income, as compared to Net income attributable to common stockholders of $239.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020:\nWe continued our development and redevelopment of high quality shopping centers in a targeted manner amidst the pandemic, although many in process projects have stopped or slowed while we evaluate current market conditions and assess the feasibility of these projects.  As of December 31, 2020, we have a total of 14 properties in process of development or redevelopment with total estimated Pro-rata project costs of $319.3 million as compared to 22 properties and $350.8 million at December 31, 2019.\nWe maintained a conservative balance sheet providing liquidity and financial flexibility to respond to these uncertain economic times and to cost effectively fund investment commitments, opportunities, and debt maturities:\n40\nLeasing Activity and Significant Tenants\nWe believe our high-quality, grocery anchored shopping centers located in densely populated, desirable infill trade areas create attractive spaces for retail and service providers to operate their businesses.\nPro-rata Percent Leased\nThe following table summarizes Pro-rata percent leased of our combined Consolidated and Unconsolidated shopping center portfolio:\nOur percent leased in both the Anchor and Shop space categories declined during 2020 due to tenant closures and bankruptcies primarily as a result from the impacts of the pandemic.  Additionally, a number of tenants at our properties were either required or elected to temporarily close due to the pandemic.  Some of these tenants may be unable to sustain their business models in this current pandemic environment and may fail.  While the pandemic continues, we may be unable to find suitable replacement tenants for an extended period of time and the terms of the leases with replacement tenants may be less favorable to us.  As such, our percent leased could decline further in future periods, resulting in reduced Lease income from both lower base rent and recoveries from tenants for CAM, real estate taxes, and insurance costs at our centers.\nPro-rata Leasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes leasing activity, including our Pro-rata share of activity within the portfolio of our co-investment partnerships:\nNew leasing activity has declined as many businesses delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts from the pandemic; however, renewal leasing activity has remained consistent with 2019 levels.  New and renewal rent spreads, as compared to prior rents on these same spaces leased, remained positive at 2.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, although the spreads tightened throughout the year as compared to 5.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.  With\n41\nthe average annual base rent of all shop space leases due to expire during the next 12 months of $33.37 PSF, there is a possibility of negative rent spreads\noccurring as we execute\nnew or renewal lease deals, considering the t\notal weighted average base rent on signed shop space leases during\n2020\nwas\nlower at\n$32.87\nPSF\n.\nSignificant Tenants and Concentrations of Risk\nWe seek to reduce our operating and leasing risks through geographic diversification and by avoiding dependence on any single property, market, or tenant.  Based on percentage of annualized base rent, the following table summarizes our most significant tenants, of which the top four are grocers:\nBankruptcies and Credit Concerns\nThe impact of bankruptcies may increase significantly if tenants occupying our centers are unable to withstand and recover from the disruptions caused by the pandemic, which could materially adversely impact our Lease income.  Since the pandemic began, we have seen an increase in the number of tenants filing for bankruptcy.  Due to the pandemic there has been and continues to be a greater focus on whether tenants’ businesses are considered essential or non-essential, which may directly impact the tenants’ ability to operate and generate sufficient cash flows to meet their operating expenses, including lease payments.  Continued higher unemployment levels could also negatively impact consumer spending and, along with large-scale business failures, have an adverse effect on our results from operations.  We seek to mitigate these potential impacts through tenant diversification, replacing weaker tenants with stronger operators, anchoring our centers with market leading grocery stores that drive customer traffic, and maintaining a presence in affluent suburbs and dense infill trade areas.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately 63% of Pro-rata average base rent in our portfolio is derived from tenants’ businesses classified as essential.\nSince the pandemic began, the Company has been closely monitoring its cash collections which significantly declined from historic levels in the initial months of the pandemic, most notably from tenants whose businesses are classified as non-essential.  The pandemic has continued to result in certain tenants requesting concessions from rent obligations, including deferrals, abatements and requests to negotiate future rents, while some tenants have been unable to reopen or have not honored the terms of their existing lease agreements.  The Company has entered into approximately 1,600 agreements, representing $40.8 million of Pro-rata base rent or 4.6% of our total annual base rent, with tenants within our consolidated real estate portfolio and our unconsolidated real estate investment partnerships, enabling them to defer a portion of their rental payments and repay them over future periods.  The Company expects to continue to work with other tenants, which may result in further rent concessions or legal actions as determined to be necessary and appropriate.  Due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, there can be no assurances that all such deferred rent will ultimately be collected, or collected within the timeframes agreed upon.\nWe closely monitor the operating performance of tenants in our shopping centers as well as those experiencing significant changes to their business models, as can be seen through reduced customer traffic in their stores.  Operators / tenants who are unable to withstand these and other business pressures, such as significant cash flow declines or debt maturities, may file for bankruptcy.  As a result of our research and findings, we may reduce new leasing, suspend leasing, or curtail allowances for construction of leasehold improvements within certain retail categories or to a specific tenant in order to reduce our risk of loss from bankruptcies and store closings.\nAlthough base rent is supported by long-term lease contracts, tenants who file bankruptcy generally have the legal right to reject any or all of their leases and close related stores.  Any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant for unpaid rent might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims.  As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold.  Additionally, we may incur significant expense to adjudicate our claim and to release the vacated space.  In the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases, we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues.  As of December 31, 2020, tenants who are currently in bankruptcy and continue to occupy space in our shopping centers represent an aggregate of 0.4% of our annual base rent on a Pro-rata basis.  We anticipate fewer tenant bankruptcies in 2021, but it is possible they could increase depending on the length and severity of the pandemic.\n42\nResults from Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019\n:\nOur revenues changed as summarized in the following table:\nLease income decreased $114.1 million, driven by the following contractually billable components of rent to the tenants per the lease agreements:\n$105.1 million decrease from recognizing additional Uncollectible lease income, consisting of $28.1 million increase in uncollectible Straight-line rent receivables and $77.0 million increase in uncollectible billable tenant receivables.  The pandemic has been most impactful to those tenants considered non-essential by governmental authorities. The current economic environment has resulted in changes in our expectations of collecting certain tenant receivables and their related future contracted rent increases previously recognized through straight-line rent.\nApproximately 92% of Pro-rata base rent billed for the three months ended December 31, 2020, has been collected as of February 8, 2021.\n$5.7 million decrease from billable Base rent, as follows:\n$3.2 million decrease in Above and below market rent primarily from the sale of operating properties.\n$1.6 million increase in Other lease income from higher lease termination fees.\n$1.4 million decrease in Percentage rent due to lower sales in this pandemic environment by certain tenants.\n$361,000 remaining net decrease driven primarily by a reduction in straight-line rent.\nManagement, transaction and other fees decreased $3.1 million primarily from decreases in development, construction management, and property management fees from projects within our unconsolidated partnerships.  Two development projects within our unconsolidated partnerships completed during 2019, resulting in reduced development fees in 2020.  Additionally, decreases in property rent collections during this pandemic have negatively impacted our property management income earned from our unconsolidated partnerships.\nChanges in our operating expenses are summarized in the following table:\nDepreciation and amortization costs changed as follows:\n43\nOperating and maintenance costs remained steady even with increases in property insurance premiums as those increases were offset by decreases in common area maintenance costs during the pandemic and a decrease in lease termination expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses remained constant although there was a $10.2 million increase from less development overhead capitalized as many development and redevelopment projects were delayed due to the pandemic, offset by $8.2 million decrease in incentive compensation costs, and $2.3 million decrease in other expenses related to lower travel and conference costs amidst the pandemic.\nReal estate taxes changed as follows:\nOther operating expenses increased $4.8 million primarily attributable to a $7.9 million increase in development pursuit costs charged to expense for abandoned projects, offset by a $2.9 million decrease in state and franchise taxes.\nThe following table presents the components of other expense (income):\nThe $5.4 million net increase in total interest expense is primarily due to:\n44\nDuring the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2020\n, we recognized $132.1 million of Goodwill impairment, due to the significant market and economic impacts of the\npandemic\n.  The market disruptions triggered evaluation of reporting unit fair values for goodwill impairment.  Of our 269 reporting units with goodwill, 87 reporting units were determined to have fair values lower than carrying value.  As such, goodwill impairment losses were recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe $35.6 million decrease in Provision for impairment of real estate is due to:\nDuring 2020, we recognized gains of $67.5 million from the sale of ten land parcels, five operating properties, receipt of property insurance proceeds, and the re-measurement gain from the acquisition of controlling interest in a previously held equity investment.  During 2019, we sold five operating properties and six land parcels for gains totaling $24.2 million.\nDuring 2020, we incurred $21.8 million of debt extinguishment costs of which $19.4 million related to the early redemption of our unsecured notes due to mature in 2022 and a $2.4 million charge for termination of an interest rate swap on our term loan that was repaid in January 2021.  During 2019, we redeemed unsecured notes and repaid one mortgage, all prior to original maturity, resulting in $12 million of debt extinguishment costs.\nOur equity in income (losses) of investments in real estate partnerships changed as follows:\nThe $26.8 million decrease in total Equity in income in investments in real estate partnerships is attributed to:\n45\nThe following represents the remaining components that comprise net income attributable to the common stockholders and unit holders:\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nFor a comparison of our results from operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 18, 2020.\nSupplemental Earnings Information\nWe use certain non-GAAP performance measures, in addition to certain performance metrics determined under GAAP, as we believe these measures improve the understanding of our operating results.  We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.  Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.  We provide Pro-rata financial information because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP.  We believe presenting our Pro-rata share of operating results, along with other non-GAAP measures, may assist in comparing our operating results to other REITs.  We continually evaluate the usefulness, relevance, limitations, and calculation of our reported non-GAAP performance measures to determine how best to provide relevant information to the public, and thus such reported measures could change.  See “Defined Terms” in Part I, Item 1.\nWe do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders.  The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements.  In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.  In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating our financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects.\n46\nPro-rata\nSame Property NOI:\nOur Pro-rata same property NOI changed as follows:\nBillable Base rent decreased $3.2 million due to loss of rents from bankruptcies and other tenant move-outs which were partially offset by contractual rent increases.\nRecoveries from tenants decreased $1.2 million largely due to declines in percent leased stemming from bankruptcies and other tenant move-outs.\nPercentage rent decreased $1.5 million principally due to lower tenant sales which were impacted by lockdowns during the pandemic which affected customer traffic and tenant sales.\nTermination fees increased $4.3 million primarily due to strategic changes in merchandising mix and negotiated terminations for tenant failures related to COVID-19.\nUncollectible lease income increased $79.0 million due to changes in collection expectations of our lease income caused by the impact of the pandemic on our tenants.\nOther property income decreased $1.1 million primarily due to reduced demand for paid parking during the pandemic.\nReal estate taxes increased $5.8 million due to changes in assessed values at properties across our portfolio.\nSame Property Rollforward:\nOur same property pool includes the following property count, Pro-rata GLA, and changes therein:\n47\nN\nareit\nFFO:\nOur reconciliation of net income attributable to common stock and unit holders to Nareit FFO is as follows:\nReconciliation of Same Property NOI to Nearest GAAP Measure:\nOur reconciliation of Net income attributable to common stockholders to Same Property NOI, on a Pro-rata basis, is as follows:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe use cash flows generated from operating, investing, and financing activities to strengthen our balance sheet, finance our development and redevelopment projects, fund our investment activities, and maintain financial flexibility.  We continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt or equity, to repay maturing debt, or fund our capital commitments.\nExcept for $200 million of private placement debt, our Parent Company has no capital commitments other than its guarantees of the commitments of our Operating Partnership.  All remaining debt is held by our Operating Partnership or by our co-investment partnerships.  The Operating Partnership is a co-issuer and a guarantor of the $200 million of outstanding debt of our Parent Company.  The Parent Company will from time to time access the capital markets for the purpose of issuing new equity and will simultaneously contribute all of the offering proceeds to the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional partnership units.\nAs the pandemic and its related impacts continue to evolve, we have taken the following steps to ensure sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility:\n48\nWe also continue to closely monitor and assess the capital requirements of all in process and planned developments, redevelopments, and capital expenditures, which has resulted in our delaying, phasing or curtailing certain in-process and planned development, redevelopment and capital expenditure projects.  We have no unsecured debt maturities until 2024 and a manageable level of secured mortgage maturities during 2021, including those mortgages within our joint ventures.\nWe continually evaluate alternative financing options, and we believe we can obtain financing on reasonable terms; however, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us.\nBased upon our available cash balance, sources of capital, our current credit ratings, the number of high quality, unencumbered properties we own, and our decisions to delay, phase or curtail projects, we believe our available capital resources are sufficient to meet our expected capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nIn addition to our unrestricted cash at December 31, 2020, we have the following additional sources of capital available:\nThe declaration of dividends is determined quarterly by our Board of Directors.  On February 10, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a common stock dividend of $0.595 per share, payable on April 6, 2021, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2021.  While future dividends will be determined at the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to continue paying an aggregate amount of distributions to our stock and unit holders that, at a minimum, meet the requirements to continue qualifying as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nWe have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our dividend distributions.  During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated cash flow from operations of $499.1 million and $621.3 million, respectively, and paid $403.3 million and $391.6 million in dividends to our common stock and unit holders, respectively, including the payment of the dividend we declared on December 15, 2020 and paid on January 5, 2021 of $101.4 million.  We are closely monitoring our cash collections from our tenants which significantly declined from historic levels at the start of the pandemic and resulting restrictions.  As of February 8, 2021, we experienced sequential improvement in our collection rates of Pro-rata base rent billed by quarter in 2020 as follows:\nBased upon our collection experience since the pandemic began, we expect our collection rates will continue to trend lower than historical pre-pandemic averages for the foreseeable future until the vaccines are fully deployed, restrictions are lifted, and the percent\n49\nleased in our shopping centers increases\n.\nIf our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our current dividend level, a reduction in our cash dividend may be necessary or dividends could be paid in Regency stock, in order to remain in compliance with minimum REIT distributions.\nWe currently have 14 development and redevelopment projects in various stages of construction, along with a pipeline of potential projects for future development or redevelopment.  As the effects of the pandemic remain uncertain, we continue to evaluate the pandemic’s impacts on the feasibility of our pipeline projects and non-essential capital expenditures, including project scope, investment, tenant use, timing and return on investment.\nAfter repaying our $265 million Term Loan and funding our dividend payment in January 2021 with cash on hand, we estimate that we will require capital during the next twelve months of approximately $353.6 million to repay maturing debt, to fund construction and related costs for committed tenant improvements and in-process development and redevelopment, and to make capital contributions to our co-investment partnerships.  If we start new developments or redevelopments, commit to new acquisitions, prepay debt prior to maturity, or repurchase shares of our common stock, our cash requirements will increase.  The combination of our $1.2 billion capacity available on our Line and no unsecured debt maturities until 2024\nstrengthens our financial position enabling us to fund our expected near-term operating and capital expenditures amid the uncertainty of operating cash flows during this pandemic and recovery period.  We expect to generate the necessary cash to fund our long-term capital needs from cash flow from operations, borrowings from our Line, proceeds from the sale of real estate, mortgage loan and unsecured bank financing, and when the capital markets are favorable, proceeds from the sale of equity or the issuance of new unsecured debt.\nWe endeavor to maintain a high percentage of unencumbered assets, as measured by 89.6% of our wholly-owned real estate assets being unencumbered at December 31, 2020.  Such assets allow us to access the secured and unsecured debt markets and to maintain availability on the Line.  Our trailing twelve month Fixed charge coverage ratio, including our Pro-rata share of our partnerships, was 3.6x and 4.3x for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and our Pro-rata net debt-to-operating EBITDA\nre\nratio on a trailing twelve month basis was 6.0x and 5.4x, respectively, for the same periods.  We expect that these ratios could worsen during 2021 as a result of potential further impacts from the ongoing pandemic.\nOur Line, Term Loan, and unsecured debt require that we remain in compliance with various covenants, which are described in note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We are in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2020, and expect to remain in compliance.\nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\nThe following table summarizes net cash flows related to operating, investing, and financing activities of the Company:\nNet cash provided by operating activities:\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $122.2 million due to:\n50\nNet cash used in investing activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities changed by $257.1 million as follows:\nSignificant investing activities included:\nDuring the same period in 2019, we invested $66.9 million in our real estate partnerships, including:\n51\nWe plan to continue developing and redeveloping shopping centers for long-term investment\n,\nalthough in the midst of the\npandemic\nwe are re-evaluating\nthe feasibility\nof\nall pipeline development and redevelopment projects\n.\nThis evaluation may result\nin curtailment, delay or ph\nasing of\nsome or all\nprojects, as well as limiting capital expenditures not immediately necessary as the economic situation continues to unfold.\nDuring\n2020\n, we deployed capital of\n$180.8 million\nfor the development, redevelopment, and improvement of our\nreal estate properties,\ncomprised of the following:\n52\nThe following table summarizes our development projects\nin-process and completed\n:\nThe following table summarizes our redevelopment projects in-process and completed:\n53\nNet cash used in\nfinancing activities:\nNet cash flows used in financing activities changed during 2020, as follows:\nSignificant financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include the following:\n54\nContractual Obligations\nWe have debt obligations related to our mortgage loans, unsecured notes, unsecured credit facilities, interest rate swap obligations, and lease agreements as described further below and in notes 4, 7, 9, and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We have shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable long-term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us to construct and/or operate a shopping center.  We also have non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which we conduct our business.\nThe following table of Contractual Obligations summarizes our debt maturities, including our Pro-rata share of obligations within co-investment partnerships as of December 31, 2020, and excludes the following:\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nKnowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial statements.  The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities as of a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period.  These accounting estimates are based upon, but not limited to, our judgments about historical and expected future results, current market conditions, and interpretation of industry accounting standards.  They are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments, or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates.  We review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness; however, the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates.\n55\nCollectibility of Lease Income\nLease income, which includes base rent, percentage rent, and recoveries from tenants for common area maintenance costs, insurance and real estate taxes are the Company's principal source of revenue.  As a result of generating this revenue, we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants.\nLease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date.  At lease commencement, the Company generally expects that collectibility is probable due to the Company’s credit assessment of tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis.  For operating leases in which collectibility of Lease income is not considered probable, Lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized and uncollected Lease income is reversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  In addition to the lease-specific collectibility assessment, the Company may recognize a general reserve, as a reduction to Lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company’s historical collection experience.  Although we estimate uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income, actual experience may differ from those estimates.\nReal Estate Investments\nAcquisition of Real Estate Investments\nUpon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above and below-market leases and in-place leases), assumed debt, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date.  Based on these estimates, the Company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities.  Transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized, while such costs are expensed for business combinations in the period incurred.  Beginning in July 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update 2017-01,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805):  Clarifying the Definition of a Business\n, under which the acquisition of operating properties are generally considered asset acquisitions.  If, however, the acquisition is determined to be a business combination, any excess consideration above the fair value allocated to the applicable assets and liabilities results in goodwill.  Fair value is determined based on an exit price approach, which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Company's methodology for determining fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.\nThe value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period.  The value of in-place leases is recorded to Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.\nChanges to these assumptions could result in a different pattern of recognition.  If tenants do not remain in their lease through the expected term or exercise an assumed renewal option, there could be a material impact to earnings.\nValuation of Real Estate Investments\nIn accordance with GAAP, we evaluate our real estate for impairment whenever there are indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the carrying value of our real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  If such indicators occur, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, comparable sales information, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and the resulting impairment, if any, could differ from the actual gain or loss recognized upon ultimate sale in an arm's length transaction.  If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.\nThe fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, as well as the use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  Such\n56\ncash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.\nIn estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, we generally use market data and comparable sales information.\nChanges in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations as they apply to our shopping centers pertaining primarily to specific chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning tenants, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and the presence of underground petroleum storage tanks.  We believe that the few tenants who currently operate dry cleaning plants or gas stations do so in accordance with current laws and regulations.  Generally, we endeavor to require tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers or convert them to more environmentally friendly systems, in accordance with the terms of our leases.  We also have a blanket environmental insurance policy for third-party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination.  We have also secured environmental insurance policies, where appropriate, on a relatively small number of specific properties with known contamination, in order to mitigate our environmental risk.  We monitor the shopping centers containing environmental issues and in certain cases voluntarily remediate the sites.  We also have legal obligations to remediate certain sites, and we are in the process of doing so.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had accrued liabilities of $8.3 million for our Pro-rata share of environmental remediation, including our Investments in real estate partnerships.  We believe that the ultimate remediation of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.  We can give no assurance that existing environmental studies on our shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contamination; that our estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to us; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with other unconsolidated entities (other than our unconsolidated investment partnerships) or other persons, also known as variable interest entities, not previously discussed.  Many of our unconsolidated investment partnerships’ operating properties have been financed with non-recourse loans, to which we have no repayment guarantees.\nInflation/Deflation\nInflation has been historically low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers; however, inflation may become a greater concern in the future.  Substantially all of our long-term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation, which require tenants to pay their pro-rata share of operating expenses, including common-area maintenance, real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.  In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates.  However, during deflationary periods or periods of economic weakness, minimum rents and percentage rents may decline as the supply of available retail space exceeds demand and consumer spending declines.  Percent leased declines may also result in lower recovery rates of our operating expenses.\n57"

    "text": "We are exposed to two significant components of interest rate risk:\nWe continuously monitor the capital markets and evaluate our ability to issue new debt, to repay maturing debt, or fund our commitments.  Although the capital markets have experienced volatility related to the pandemic, we continue to believe that we will be able to successfully issue new secured or unsecured debt to fund maturing debt obligations given our credit ratings, our capacity under our unsecured credit facilities, and the number of high quality, unencumbered properties that we own which could collateralize borrowings.  However, the degree to which such capital market volatility will adversely impact the interest rates on any new debt that we may issue is uncertain.\nOur interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques.  The table below presents the principal cash flows, weighted average interest rates of remaining debt, and the fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2020.  For variable rate mortgages and unsecured credit facilities for which we have interest rate swaps in place to fix the interest rate, they are included in the Fixed rate debt section below at their all-in fixed rate.  The table is presented by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes.  Although the average interest rate for variable rate debt is included in the table, those rates represent rates that existed as of December 31, 2020, and are subject to change on a monthly basis.  In addition, the Company continually assesses the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $350,000 per year based on $34.1 million of floating rate mortgage debt outstanding at December 31, 2020.  If the Company increases its line of credit balance in the future, additional decreases to future earnings and cash flows could occur.\nFurther, the table below incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2020, and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date or obligations repaid before maturity.  Since firm commitments are not presented, the table has limited predictive value.  As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at that time, and actual interest rates.\nThe table below presents the principal cash flow payments associated with our outstanding debt by year, weighted average interest rates on debt outstanding at each year-end, and fair value of total debt as of December 31, 2020.\n58"

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter, including controls related to the identification and assessment of potential indicators of impairment. Using property financial and leasing data, we performed an assessment of changes in occupancy rates, net operating income and the rate of cash collections for individual real estate properties and compared the results to the Company’s assessment. In addition, to identify a change in property condition or a shortened hold period we inquired of Company officials, attended Company quarterly meetings and inspected documents such as meeting minutes of the Company’s board of directors.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1993.\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 17, 2021\n61\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nRegency Centers Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Regency Centers Corporation’s and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 17, 2021\n62\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors of Regency\nCenters Corporation, and the\nPartners of Regency Centers, L.P.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Regency Centers, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III – Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

(the “Operating Partnership”).  The Parent Company primarily engages in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, development and redevelopment of shopping centers through the Operating Partnership, has no other assets other than through its investment in the Operating Partnership, and its only liabilities are $\n200\nmillion of unsecured private placement notes, which are co-issued and guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.  The Parent Company guarantees all of the unsecured debt of the Operating Partnership.\nAs of  December 31, 2020, the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, and their controlled subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (the “Company” or “Regency”) owned\n297\nproperties and held partial interests in an additional\n114\nproperties through unconsolidated Investments in real estate partnerships (also referred to as “joint ventures” or “co-investment partnerships”).\nEstimates, Risks, and Uncertainties\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The most significant estimates in the Company’s financial statements relate to the net carrying values of its real estate investments, collectibility of lease income, goodwill, and acquired lease intangible assets and acquired lease intangible liabilities.  It is possible that the estimates and assumptions that have been utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements could change significantly if economic conditions were to weaken.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was declared a pandemic (“COVID-19 pandemic” or the “pandemic”) by the World Health Organization as the disease spread throughout the world.  The pandemic continues to evolve, making the broader implications on the Company’s future results of operations and overall financial performance uncertain at this time.  While much of the Company’s lease income is derived from contractual rent payments, the tenants’ ability to meet their lease obligations have been negatively impacted by the disruptions and uncertainties of the pandemic.  The tenants’ ability to respond to these disruptions, including adapting to governmental orders or recommendations and changes in their customers’ shopping habits and behaviors, will influence the tenants’ ability to survive and ultimately fulfill their lease obligations.  While\nthe announcement of vaccine approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in early December 2020 was a positive development, at about the same time, several states and many localities reinstituted mandatory business limitations and closures as cases spiked again, in advance of full scale vaccine deployment.  Further, forced closures may occur as cases spike or additional strains of the virus emerge, while the speed of vaccine rollout remains uncertain.\nDue to the pandemic, certain tenants have requested rent concessions or have sought to renegotiate future rents based on changes to the economic environment.  Other tenants have chosen not to reopen or honor the terms of their existing lease agreements.\nIn addition, in 2020 we saw a meaningful spike in the number of bankruptcy filings by our tenants versus prior years, which in certain cases can lead to a tenant “rejecting” (terminating) one or more of our leases as permitted by applicable bankruptcy law, or seeking to negotiate reduced rent as part of the bankruptcy reorganization process.\nThe Company is closely monitoring its cash collections from its tenants which significantly declined from historic levels at the start of the pandemic but have since gradually improved.\nAs of February 8, 2021, we experienced sequential improvement in our collection rates of Pro-rata base rent billed by quarter in 2020 as follows:\nSince the pandemic began, the Company has executed approximately 1,600 rent deferral agreements within its consolidated and unconsolidated real estate portfolio.  The weighted average deferral period of these agreements is approximately 3.3 months, with repayment periods of approximately 9.7 months beginning in December 2020.  The Company expects to continue to work with tenants to address the adverse impacts of the pandemic, which may result in further rent deferrals, concessions or abatements.  As a result, there can be no assurance that our base rent collection percentages will continue at or\n80\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS,

reduce their operations or close, our base rent collection percentages\nand\npercent leased\ncould decline from recent 2020 levels.\nNew leasing activity declined in 2020 and is expected to remain below 2019 levels into 2021 as businesses delay executing leases amidst the immediate and uncertain future economic impacts of the pandemic.  This, coupled with tenant failures and bankruptcies, may result in decreased demand for space in our centers, which could result in pricing pressure on rents.  Additionally, if construction of tenant improvements are delayed due to the impacts of the pandemic, it may take longer before new tenants are able to open and commence rent payments, or attract new tenants.\nThe pandemic has adversely impacted the Company’s ability to start or complete tenant buildouts, new ground up development, or redevelopment of existing properties.  The pandemic has also impacted the Company’s ability to timely source materials for construction and has caused labor shortages which have impacted its ability to complete construction projects on anticipated schedules.  In the event a surge in new cases resulting in additional lockdowns occurs, similar impacts to the Company’s supply chain may arise which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation.  The Company continues to closely monitor its projects, which has resulted in prudently delaying, phasing or curtailing certain in-process and planned development, redevelopment and capital expenditure projects.\nThe duration and severity of the pandemic across the United States will continue to negatively impact many of the Company’s tenants, and their ability to meet their rent obligations under their lease agreements with the Company.  As such, the impact from the pandemic could still negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nOur business continuity and disaster recovery plan enabled us to continue operating productively during the pandemic.  We have maintained, and expect to continue to maintain, without interruption, our financial reporting systems as well as our internal controls over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nConsolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company, the Operating Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and consolidated partnerships in which the Company has a controlling interest.  Investments in real estate partnerships not controlled by the Company are accounted for under the equity method.  All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company consolidates properties that are wholly owned or properties where it owns less than 100%, but which it has control over the activities most important to the overall success of the partnership.  Control is determined using an evaluation based on accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting interest entities.  For joint ventures that are determined to be a VIE, the Company consolidates the entity where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Determination of the primary beneficiary is based on whether an entity has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n81\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nOwnership of the Parent Company\nThe Parent Company has a single class of common stock outstanding.\nOwnership of the Operating Partnership\nThe Operating Partnership's capital includes general and limited common Partnership Units.  As of December 31, 2020, the Parent Company owned approximately\n99.6\n%, or\n169,680,138\n, of the\n170,445,184\noutstanding common Partnership Units of the Operating Partnership, with the remaining limited common Partnership Units held by third parties (“Exchangeable operating partnership units” or “EOP units”).  Each EOP unit is exchangeable for cash or one share of common stock of the Parent Company, at the discretion of the Parent Company, and the unit holder cannot require redemption in cash or other assets (i.e. registered shares of the Parent).  The Parent Company has evaluated the conditions as specified under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480,\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity\nas it relates to exchangeable operating partnership units outstanding and concluded that it has the right to satisfy the redemption requirements of the units by delivering unregistered common stock.  Accordingly, the Parent Company classifies EOP units as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity and Comprehensive Income.  The Parent Company serves as general partner of the Operating Partnership.  The EOP unit holders have limited rights over the Operating Partnership such that they do not have the power to direct the activities of the Operating Partnership.  As such, the Operating Partnership is considered a VIE, and the Parent Company, which consolidates it, is the primary beneficiary.  The Parent Company's only investment is the Operating Partnership.  Net income and distributions of the Operating Partnership are allocable to the general and limited common Partnership Units in accordance with their ownership percentages.\nReal Estate Partnerships\nRegency has a partial ownership interest in\n124\nproperties through partnerships, of which\n10\nare consolidated. Regency's partners include institutional investors and other real estate developers and/or operators (the “Partners” or “Limited Partners”).  Regency has a variable interest in these entities through its equity interests.  As managing member, Regency maintains the books and records and typically provides leasing and property and asset management services to the partnerships.  The Partners’ level of involvement in these partnerships varies from protective decisions (debt, bankruptcy, selling primary asset(s) of business) to participating involvement such as approving leases, operating budgets, and capital budgets.  The assets of these partnerships are restricted to the use of the partnerships and cannot be used by general creditors of the Company.  And similarly, the obligations of these partnerships can only be settled by the assets of these partnerships or additional contributions by the partners.\nThe net difference in the carrying amount of investments in real estate partnerships and the underlying equity in net assets is accreted to earnings and recorded in Equity in income of investments in real estate partnerships in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations over the expected useful lives of the properties and other intangible assets, which range in lives from\n10\nto\n40\nyears\n.\n82\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe majority of the operations of the VIEs are funded with cash flows generated by the properties, or in the case of developments, with capital contributions or third party construction loans.\nThe major classes of assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling equity interests held by the Company's consolidated VIEs, exclusive of the Operating Partnership, are as follows:\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling Interests of the Parent Company\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company include the following ownership interests held by owners other than the common stockholders of the Parent Company: (i) the limited Partnership Units in the Operating Partnership held by third parties (“Exchangeable operating partnership units”) and (ii) the minority-owned interest held by third parties in consolidated partnerships (“Limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships”).  The Parent Company has included all of these noncontrolling interests in permanent equity, separate from the Parent Company's stockholders' equity, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.  The portion of net income or comprehensive income attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income of the Parent Company.\nLimited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are not redeemable by the holders.  The Parent Company also evaluated its fiduciary duties to itself, its shareholders, and, as the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, to the Operating Partnership, and concluded its fiduciary duties are not in conflict with each other or the underlying agreements.  Therefore, the Parent Company classifies such units and interests as permanent equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Equity.\nNoncontrolling Interests of the Operating Partnership\nThe Operating Partnership has determined that limited partners' interests in consolidated partnerships are noncontrolling interests.  Subject to certain conditions and pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements, the Company generally has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the other member’s interest or sell its own interest in these consolidated partnerships.  The Operating Partnership has included these noncontrolling interests in permanent capital, separate from partners' capital, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capital.  The portion of net income (loss) or comprehensive income (loss) attributable to these noncontrolling interests is included in net income and comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements Comprehensive Income of the Operating Partnership.\nLeasing Income and Tenant Receivables\nThe Company leases space to tenants under agreements with varying terms that generally provide for fixed payments of base rent, with stated increases over the term of the lease.  Some of the lease agreements contain provisions that provide for\n83\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nadditional rents based on tenants' sales volume (\n“\npercentage rent\n”\n)\n, which are\nrecognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements.  Additionally, most lease agreements contain provisions for reimbursement of the tenants' share of actual real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance (“CAM”) costs (collectively\n“\nRecoverable Costs\n”\n) incurred.\nLease terms generally range from\nthree\nto\nseven\nyears\nfor tenant space under\n10,000\nsquare feet (“Shop Space”) and in excess of\nfive years\nfor spaces greater than\n10,000\nsquare feet (“Anchor Space”).  Many leases also provide the option for the tenants to extend their lease beyond the initial term of the lease.  If a tenant does not exercise its option or otherwise negotiate to renew, the lease expires and the lease contains an obligation for the tenant to relinquish its space, allowing it to be leased to a new tenant.  This generally involves some level of cost to prepare the space for re-leasing, which is capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the life of the subsequent lease or the life of the improvement.\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 842,\nLeases,\nincluding all related Accounting Standard Updates (“ASU”).  Prior to that, the Company applied ASC Topic 840,\nLeases\n, which required similar straight line lease income and expense recognition, and allowed initial indirect leasing costs to be deferred, but did not require balance sheet recognition of Right of use assets or Lease liabilities.\nClassification\nUnder\nTopic\n842, new leases or modifications thereto must be evaluated against specific classification criteria, which, based on the customary terms of the Company’s leases, are classified as operating leases, similar to the Company’s lease classification under the previous Topic 840.  However, certain longer-term leases (both lessee and lessor leases) may be classified as direct financing or sales type leases, which may result in selling profit and an accelerated pattern of earnings recognition.  At December 31, 2020, all of the Company’s leases were classified as operating leases.  See the pandemic discussion that follows for unique considerations amidst the pandemic.\nRecognition and Presentation\nCAM is a non-lease component of the lease contract under Topic 842, and therefore recognition for these CAM expenses would be accounted for under Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, and presented separate from Lease income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, based on an allocation of the overall consideration in the lease contract, which is not necessarily the amount that would be billable to the tenants for CAM reimbursements per the terms of the lease contract.  As the timing and pattern of providing the CAM service to the tenant is the same as the timing and pattern of the tenants' use of the underlying lease asset, the Company elected, as part of an available practical expedient, to combine CAM with the remaining lease components, along with tenants' reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance, and recognize them together as Lease income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCollectibility\nLease income for operating leases with fixed payment terms is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease for all leases for which collectibility is considered probable at the commencement date.  At lease commencement, the Company generally expects that collectibility of substantially all payments due under the lease is probable due to the Company’s credit checks on tenants and other creditworthiness analysis undertaken before entering into a new lease; therefore, income from most operating leases is initially recognized on a straight-line basis.  For operating leases in which collectibility of Lease income is not considered probable, Lease income is recognized on a cash basis and all previously recognized straight-line rent receivables are reversed in the period in which the Lease income is determined not to be probable of collection.  In addition to the lease-specific collectibility assessment performed under Topic 842, the Company may also recognize a general reserve, as a reduction to Lease income, for its portfolio of operating lease receivables which are not expected to be fully collectible based on the Company’s historical collection experience.\nThe Company estimates the collectibility of the accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rents, recoveries from tenants, and other revenue taking into consideration the Company's historical write-off experience, tenant credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and remaining lease terms.  Beginning with the adoption of ASC 842, Leases, on January 1, 2019, uncollectible lease income is a direct charge against Lease income.  Prior to 2019, uncollectible lease income was recorded in Other operating expenses, while uncollectible straight line rent was recorded as a charge to Lease income.\n84\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and\nRent Concessions\nDuring 2020, in response to the pandemic and the resulting entry into agreements for rent concessions between tenants and landlords, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19.  In this guidance, entities could elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions, and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract.  This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the right of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee.  The Company has elected to treat concessions that satisfy this criteria as though the concession was part of the existing contract and therefore not treated like a lease modification.\nSince the pandemic began, the Company has executed approximately\n1,600\nrent deferral agreements representing $\n40.8\nmillion of rent or\n4.6\n% of Pro-rata annual base rent, within its consolidated and unconsolidated real estate portfolio.  The weighted average deferral period of these agreements is approximately\n3.3 months\n, with repayment periods of approximately\n9.7 months\nbeginning in December 2020.  The Company will continue to negotiate with some tenants, which may result in further rent concessions as determined necessary and appropriate.  Collectibility assessment of these concessions generally includes consideration of the tenants’ business performance, ability to sustain their business in the current environment, as well as an assessment of their credit worthiness and ability to repay such amounts in the future.\nThe following table represents the components of Tenant and other receivables, net of amounts considered uncollectible, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nReal Estate Sales\nThe Company accounts for sales of nonfinancial assets under Subtopic 610-20, whereby the Company derecognizes real estate and recognizes a gain or loss on sales when a contract exists and control of the property has transferred to the buyer.  Control of the property, including controlling financial interest, is generally considered to transfer upon closing through transfer of the legal title and possession of the property.  Any retained noncontrolling interest is measured at fair value at that time.  The adoption this Subtopic 610-20 on January 1, 2018, resulted in the recognition, through opening retained\nearnings, of $\n30.9\nmillion of previously deferred gains from property sales to the Company's Investments in real estate partnerships.\nManagement Services and Other Property Income\nThe Company recognizes revenue under Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\nwhen or as control of the promised services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.  The following is a description of the Company's revenue from contracts with customers within the scope of Topic 606.\nProperty and Asset Management Services\nThe Company is engaged under agreements with its joint venture partnerships, which are generally perpetual in nature and cancellable through unanimous partner approval, absent an event of default.  Under these agreements, the Company is to provide asset and property management and leasing services for the joint ventures' shopping centers.  The fees are market-based, generally calculated as a percentage of either revenues earned or the estimated values of the properties managed or the proceeds received, and are recognized over the monthly or quarterly periods as services are rendered.  Property management and asset management services represent a series of distinct daily services. Accordingly, the Company satisfies its performance obligation as service is rendered each day and the variability associated with that compensation is resolved each day.  Amounts due from the partnerships for such services are paid during the month following the monthly or quarterly service periods.\n85\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nSeveral of the Company’s partnership agreements provide for incentive payments, generally referred to as “promotes” or “earnouts,” to Regency for appreciation in property values in Regency's capacity as manager.\nThe terms of these promotes are based on appreciation in real estate value over designated time intervals\nor upon designated\nevents\n.\nThe Company evaluates its expected promote payout at each reporting period, which generally does not result in revenue recognition until the measurement period has completed, when the amount can be reasonably determined and the amount is not probable of significant reversal.\nThe Company did not recognize any promote revenue during the\nyears ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n,\n2019\n, or\n2018\n.\nLeasing Services\nLeasing service fees are based on a percentage of the total rent due under the lease.  The leasing service is considered performed upon successful execution of an acceptable tenant lease for the joint ventures’ shopping centers, at which time revenue is recognized.  Payment of the first half of the fee\nis generally due upon lease execution and the second half is generally due upon tenant opening or rent payments commencing.\nTransaction Services\nThe Company also receives transaction fees, as contractually agreed upon with each joint venture, which include acquisition fees, disposition fees, and financing service fees. Control of these services is generally transferred at the time the related transaction closes, which is the point in time when the Company recognizes the related fee revenue.  Any unpaid amounts related to transaction-based fees are included in Tenant and other receivables within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Property Income\nOther property income includes parking fee and other incidental income from the properties and is generally recognized at the point in time that the performance obligation is met.\nAll income from contracts with the Company’s real estate partnerships is included within Management, transaction and other fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The primary components of these revenue streams, the timing of satisfying the performance obligations, and amounts are as follows:\nThe accounts receivable for management services, which are included within Tenant and other receivables in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, are $\n9.9\nmillion and $\n11.6\nmillion, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table details the components of Real estate assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n86\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nCapitalization and Depreciation\nMaintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are recorded in operating and maintenance expense.\nAs part of the leasing process, the Company may provide the lessee with an allowance for the construction of leasehold improvements.  These leasehold improvements are capitalized and recorded as tenant improvements, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the remaining lease term.  If the allowance represents a payment for a purpose other than funding leasehold improvements, or in the event the Company is not considered the owner of the improvements, the allowance is considered to be a lease incentive and is recognized over the lease term as a reduction of Lease income.  Factors considered during this evaluation include, among other things, who holds legal title to the improvements as well as other controlling rights provided by the lease agreement and provisions for substantiation of such costs (e.g. unilateral control of the tenant space during the build-out process).  Determination of the appropriate accounting for the payment of a tenant allowance is made on a lease-by-lease basis, considering the facts and circumstances of the individual tenant lease.\nDepreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of approximately\n15\nyears for land improvements,\n40\nyears for buildings and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term subject to a maximum of\n10\nyears for tenant improvements, and\nthree\nto\nseven\nyears\nfor furniture and equipment.\nDevelopment and Redevelopment Costs\nLand, buildings, and improvements are recorded at cost.  All specifically identifiable costs related to development and redevelopment activities are capitalized into Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are included in Construction in progress within the above table.  The capitalized costs include pre-development costs essential to the development or redevelopment of the property, development / redevelopment costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, and allocated direct employee costs incurred during the period of development or redevelopment.\nPre-development costs represent the costs the Company incurs prior to land acquisition or pursuing a redevelopment including contract deposits, as well as legal, engineering, and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing or redeveloping a shopping center.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had nonrefundable deposits and other pre development costs of approximately $\n25.3\nmillion and $\n17.7\nmillion, respectively.  If the Company determines that the development or redevelopment of a particular shopping center is no longer probable, any related pre-development costs previously capitalized are immediately expensed.  During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company expensed pre-development costs of approximately $\n10.5\nmillion, $\n2.5\nmillion, and $\n1.9\nmillion, respectively, in Other operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest costs are capitalized into each development and redevelopment project based upon applying the Company's weighted average borrowing rate to that portion of the actual development or redevelopment costs expended.  The Company discontinues interest and real estate tax capitalization when the property is no longer being developed or is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in no event would the Company capitalize interest on the project beyond\n12\nmonths after substantial completion of the building shell.  During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company capitalized interest of $\n4.4\nmillion, $\n4.2\nmillion, and $\n7.0\nmillion, respectively, on our development and redevelopment projects.\nWe have a staff of employees directly supporting our development and redevelopment program.  All direct internal costs attributable to these development activities are capitalized as part of each development and redevelopment project.  The capitalization of costs is directly related to the actual level of development activity occurring.  During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we capitalized $\n10.2\nmillion, $\n20.4\nmillion, and $\n17.1\nmillion, respectively, of direct internal costs incurred to support our development and redevelopment program.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company generally accounts for operating property acquisitions as asset acquisitions.  The Company capitalizes transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions and expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations.  Both asset acquisitions and business combinations require that the Company recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the operating property acquired (“acquiree”).\nThe Company's methodology includes estimating an “as-if vacant” fair value of the physical property, which includes land, building, and improvements.  In addition, the Company determines the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, considering the following categories: (i) value of in-place leases, and (ii) above and below-market value of in-place leases.\n87\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe value of in-place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases compared to the acquired in-place leases as well as the value associated with lost rental and recovery revenue during the assumed lease-up period.\nThe value of in-place leases is recorded to Depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the remaining expected term of the respective leases.\nAbove-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for comparable in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The value of above-market leases is amortized as a reduction of Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and the value of below-market leases is accreted to Lease income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including below-market renewal options, if applicable.  The Company does not assign value to customer\nrelationship intangibles if it has pre-existing business relationships with the major retailers at the acquired property since they do not provide incremental value over the Company's existing relationships.\nHeld for Sale\nThe Company classifies land, an operating property, or a property in development as held-for-sale upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan to sell a property (or group of properties), (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such properties, (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the property have been initiated, (iv) the sale of the property is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale, and (vi) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.  Properties held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.\nImpairment\nWe evaluate whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance and general market conditions, that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may not be recoverable.  For those properties with such indicators, management evaluates recoverability of the property's carrying amount.  Through the evaluation, we compare the current carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Our estimated cash flows are based on several key assumptions, including rental rates, expected leasing activity, costs of tenant improvements, leasing commissions, anticipated hold period, and assumptions regarding the residual value upon disposition, including the exit capitalization rate.  These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results.  Changes in our disposition strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group which may result in an impairment loss and such loss could be material to the Company's financial condition or operating performance.  To the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.  If such indicators are not identified, management will not assess the recoverability of a property's carrying value.  If a property previously classified as held and used is changed to held for sale, the Company estimates fair value, less expected costs to sell, which could cause the Company to determine that the property is impaired.\nThe fair value of real estate assets is subjective and is determined through comparable sales information and other market data if available, or through use of an income approach such as the direct capitalization method or the discounted cash flow approach.  Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors, and therefore is subject to management judgment and changes in those factors could impact the determination of fair value.  In estimating the fair value of undeveloped land, the Company generally uses market data and comparable sales information.\nA loss in value of investments in real estate partnerships under the equity method of accounting, other than a temporary decline, must be recognized in the period in which the loss occurs.  If management identifies indicators that the value of the Company's investment in real estate partnerships may be impaired, it evaluates the investment by calculating the fair value of the investment by discounting estimated future cash flows over the expected term of the investment.\nTax Basis\nThe net book basis of the Company's real estate assets exceeds the net tax basis by approximately $\n2.7\nbillion and $\n2.8\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily due to the tax free merger with Equity One and inheriting lower carryover tax basis.\n88\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nAny instruments which have an original maturity of\n90 days or less\nwhen purchased are considered cash equivalents.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $\n2.4\nmillion and $\n2.5\nmillion, respectively, of cash was restricted through escrow agreements and certain mortgage loans.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration from the Equity One merger in 2017 over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350,\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, and allocates its goodwill to its reporting units, which have been determined to be at the individual property level.  The Company performs an impairment evaluation of its goodwill at least annually, in November of each year, or more frequently as triggers occur.  See note 5.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation is completed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach.  Under a qualitative approach, the impairment review for goodwill consists of an assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill.  If a qualitative approach indicates it is more likely-than-not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit (including goodwill) exceeds its fair value, or if the Company chooses to bypass the qualitative approach for any reporting unit, the Company will perform the quantitative approach described below.\nThe quantitative approach consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted projected future cash flows and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company would then recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nInvestments\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date.  The fair value of securities is determined using quoted market prices.\nDebt securities are classified as held to maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.  Debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized through earnings in Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Debt securities not classified as held to maturity or as trading, are classified as available-for-sale, and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in the determination of comprehensive income and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income and presented within Investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDeferred leasing costs consist of costs associated with leasing the Company's shopping centers, and are presented net of accumulated amortization.  Such costs are amortized over the period through lease expiration.  If the lease is terminated early, the remaining leasing costs are written off.\nThe adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, changed the treatment of leasing costs, such that non-contingent internal leasing and legal costs associated with leasing activities can no longer be capitalized.  The Company, as a lessor, may only defer as initial direct costs the incremental costs of a tenant’s operating lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.  These costs generally consist of third party broker payments.\nThe Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or future payment of known and uncertain cash amounts, the amount of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's\n89\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nderivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company's known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company's borrowings.\nAll derivative instruments, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are recorded on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.  The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or forecasted transaction, and the Company designates these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges generally involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  The Company may also utilize cash flow hedges to lock U.S. Treasury rates in anticipation of future fixed-rate debt issuances.  The gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”).  Upon the settlement of a hedge, gains and losses remaining in AOCI are amortized through earnings over the underlying term of the hedged transaction.  The cash receipts or payments related to interest rate swaps are presented in cash flows provided by operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The Company assesses, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows and/or forecasted cash flows of the hedged items.\nIn assessing the valuation of the hedges, the Company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and termination costs at each balance sheet date.  All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\nThe Parent Company believes it qualifies, and intends to continue to qualify, as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Parent Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders are at least equal to REIT taxable income.  All wholly-owned corporate subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be a TRS or qualify as a REIT.  The TRS's are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns.  As a pass through entity, the Operating Partnership generally does not pay taxes, but its taxable income or loss is reported by its partners, of which the Parent Company, as general partner and approximately\n99.6\n%\nowner, is allocated its Pro-rata share of tax attributes.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes related to its TRS’s under the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in\neffect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is believed that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including forecasts of future taxable income, the reversal of other existing temporary differences, available net operating loss carryforwards, tax planning strategies and recent and projected results of operations in order to make that determination.\nIn addition, tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities.  Such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.  The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years (2016 and forward for federal and state) based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter.\n90\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act was signed into U.S. law on March 27, 2020 and provided an estimated $\n2.2\ntrillion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the U.S. economy. The assistance includes tax relief and government loans, grants and investments for entities in affected industries. The Company is currently evaluating the programs and tax benefits that may apply to its operations including the corporate net operating loss carryback, increases in the interest expense limitation, employee retention credit, and deferrals of both employer payroll taxes and corporate estimated taxes.\nThe Company has certain properties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties, which are all classified as operating leases.  Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties.  The building and improvements constructed on the leased land are capitalized as Real estate assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\nIn addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business.   Leasehold improvements are capitalized as tenant improvements, included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvements or the lease term.\nUpon the adoption of Topic 842, the Company recognized Lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its ground and office leases of $\n225.4\nmillion at January 1, 2019, and corresponding Right of use assets of $\n297.8\nmillion, net of or including the opening balance for straight-line rent and above / below market ground lease intangibles related to these same ground and office leases.  A key input in estimating the Lease liabilities and resulting Right of use assets is establishing the discount rate in the lease, which since the rates implicit in the lease contracts are not readily determinable, requires additional inputs for the longer-term ground leases, including market-based interest rates that correspond with the remaining term of the lease, the Company's credit spread, and a securitization adjustment necessary to reflect the collateralized payment terms present in the lease.  This discount rate is applied to the remaining unpaid minimum rental payments for each lease to measure the operating lease liabilities.\nThe ground and office lease expenses continue to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected option renewal periods.  For ground leases, the Company generally assumes it will exercise options through the latest option date of that shopping center's anchor tenant lease.\nBasic earnings per share of common stock and unit are computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and units, respectively, outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share and unit reflect the conversion of obligations and the assumed exercises of securities including the effects of shares issuable under the Company's share-based payment arrangements, if dilutive.  Dividends paid on the Company's share-based compensation awards are not participating securities as they are forfeitable.\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees and directors.  The Company recognizes the cost of stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the award, which is expensed over the vesting period.\nWhen the Parent Company issues common stock as compensation, it receives a like number of common units from the Operating Partnership.  The Company is committed to contributing to the Operating Partnership all proceeds from the share-based awards granted under the Parent Company's Long-Term Omnibus Plan (the “Plan”).  Accordingly, the Parent Company's ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase based on the amount of proceeds contributed to the Operating Partnership for the common units it receives.  As a result of the issuance of common units to the Parent Company for stock-based compensation, the Operating Partnership records the effect of stock-based compensation for awards of equity in the Parent Company.\nThe Company's business is investing in retail shopping centers through direct ownership or partnership interests.  The Company actively manages its portfolio of retail shopping centers and may from time to time make decisions to sell lower performing properties or developments not meeting its long-term investment objectives.  The proceeds from sales are generally reinvested into higher quality retail shopping centers, through acquisitions, new developments, or redevelopment of existing centers, which management believes will generate sustainable revenue growth and attractive returns.  It is\n91\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nmanagement's intent that all retail shopping centers will be owned or developed for investment purposes; however, the\nCompany may decide to\nsell all or a portion of a development upon completion.\nThe Company's revenues and net income are generated from the operation of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company also earns fees for services provided to manage and lease retail shopping centers owned through joint ventures.\nThe Company's portfolio is located throughout the United States.  Management does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical basis for purposes of allocating resources or capital.  The Company reviews operating and financial data for each property on an individual basis; therefore, the Company defines an operating segment as its individual properties.  The individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to both the nature and economics of the centers, tenants and operational processes, as well as long-term average financial performance.\nGrocer anchor tenants represent approximately\n20\n% of Pro-rata annual base rent.\nNo\nsingle tenant accounts for\n5\n% or more of revenue and\nnone\nof the shopping centers are located outside the United States.\nFair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.  Therefore, a fair value measurement is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the Company's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\nThe Company also remeasures nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, initially measured at fair value in a business combination or other new basis event, at fair value in subsequent periods if a remeasurement event occurs.\n92\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements and expected impact on our financial statements:\n93\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\n94\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\n2.\nReal Estate Investments\nAcquisitions\nThe following tables detail consolidated shopping centers acquired or land acquired for development or redevelopment for the periods set forth below:\nDispositions\nThe following table provides a summary of consolidated shopping centers and consolidated land parcels disposed of during the periods set forth below:\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company also had\ntwo\nproperties classified within Properties held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n95\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe Company invests in real estate partnerships, which consist of the following:\n96\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe summarized balance sheet information for the investments in real estate partnerships, on a combined basis, is as follows:\nThe following table reconciles the Company's capital recorded by the unconsolidated partnerships to the Company's investments in real estate partnerships reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet:\nThe revenues and expenses for the investments in real estate partnerships, on a combined basis, are summarized as follows:\n97\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nAcquisitions\nThe following table provides a summary of shopping centers and land parcels acquired through our unconsolidated real estate partnerships during 2020, which had no such acquisitions in 2019:\nDispositions\nThe following table provides a summary of shopping centers and land parcels disposed of through our unconsolidated real estate partnerships:\nNotes Payable\nScheduled principal repayments on notes payable held by our unconsolidated investments in real estate partnerships as of December 31, 2020, were as follows:\nThese fixed and variable rate loans are all non-recourse to the partnerships, and mature through\n2034\n, with\n91.5\n% having a weighted average fixed interest rate of\n4.1\n%.  The remaining notes payable float over LIBOR and had a weighted average variable interest rate of\n2.4\n% at December 31, 2020.  Maturing loans will be repaid from proceeds from refinancing, partner capital contributions, or a combination thereof.  The Company is obligated to contribute its Pro-rata share to fund maturities if the loans are not refinanced, and it has the capacity to do so from existing cash balances, availability on its line of credit, and operating cash flows.  The Company believes that its partners are financially sound and have sufficient capital or access thereto to fund future capital requirements.  In the event that a co-investment partner was unable to fund its share of the capital requirements of the co-investment partnership, the Company would have the right, but not the obligation, to loan the defaulting partner the amount of its capital call.\nManagement fee income\nIn addition to earning our Pro-rata share of net income or loss in each of these co-investment partnerships, we receive fees, as follows:\n98\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe following table represents the components of Other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nThe following table presents the goodwill balances and activity during the year to date periods ended:\nAs the Company identifies properties (“reporting units”) that no longer meet its investment criteria, it will evaluate the property for potential sale.  A decision to sell a reporting unit results in the need to evaluate its goodwill for recoverability and may result in impairment.  Additionally, other changes impacting a reporting unit may be considered a triggering event.  If events occur that trigger an impairment evaluation at multiple reporting units, a goodwill impairment may be significant.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2020, the Company recognized $\n132.2\nmillion of Goodwill impairment.  The market disruptions related to the significant economic impacts of the pandemic triggered evaluation of reporting unit fair values for goodwill impairment.  The Company’s reporting units are at the individual property level.  The carrying value of long-lived assets within each of the reporting units were first tested for recoverability with no resulting impairments.  Next, the fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its carrying value, including goodwill.  Of the\n269\nreporting units with goodwill,\n87\nof those were determined to have fair values lower than carrying value.  As such, goodwill impairment losses totaling $132.2 million were recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeded its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  Fair values of the reporting units were determined using a discounted cash flow approach, including then current market cash flow assumptions for impacts to existing tenant contractual rent as well as prospective future rent and percent leased changes and related capital and operating expenditures.  The cap rates and discount rates used in the analysis reflect management’s best estimate of market rates adjusted for the current environment.\nNo\nadditional Goodwill impairments were recognized after March 31, 2020, including as a result of the Company’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation in November 2020.\n99\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe Company had the following acquired lease intangibles:\nThe following table provides a summary of amortization and net accretion amounts from acquired lease intangibles:\nThe estimated aggregate amortization and net accretion amounts from acquired lease intangibles for the next five years are as follows:\nLessor Accounting\nAll of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases.  The Company's Lease income is comprised of both fixed and variable income.  Fixed and in-substance fixed lease income includes stated amounts per the lease contract, which are primarily related to base rent, and in some cases stated amounts for CAM, real estate taxes, and insurance.  Income for these amounts is recognized on a straight-line basis.\nVariable lease income includes the following two main items in the lease contracts:\n100\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe following table provides a disaggregation of lease income recognized as either fixed or variable lease income based on the criteria specified in ASC Topic 842:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a higher rate of uncollectible lease income driven by changes in expectations of collectibility of both past due rents and recoveries and future rent steps given the impact of the pandemic on our tenants.\nFuture minimum rents under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding variable lease payments, are as follows:\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company has shopping centers that are subject to non-cancelable, long-term ground leases where a third party owns the underlying land and has leased the land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping center.\nThe Company has\n22\nproperties within its consolidated real estate portfolio that are either partially or completely on land subject to ground leases with third parties.  Accordingly, the Company owns only a long-term leasehold or similar interest in these properties.  These ground leases expire through the year\n2101\n, and in most cases, provide for renewal options.\nIn addition, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases pertaining to office space from which it conducts its business.  Office leases expire through the year\n2029\n, and in many cases, provide for renewal options.\n101\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe ground and office lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases, including management's estimate of expected option renewal periods.\nOperating lease expense under the Company's ground and office leases was as follows, including straight-line rent expense and variable lease expenses such as CPI increases, percentage rent and reimbursements of landlord costs:\nOperating lease expense under the Company's ground and office leases was $\n19.7\nmillion, $\n20.5\nmillion and $\n19.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively, which includes fixed and variable rent expense.\nThe following table summarizes the undiscounted future cash flows by year attributable to the operating lease liabilities under ground and office leases as of December 31, 2020, and provides a reconciliation to the Lease liability included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nThe Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with certain of its subsidiaries treated as taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) entities, which are subject to federal and state income taxes.\nThe following table summarizes the tax status of dividends paid on our common shares:\n(1)\nDuring 2020, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, the last of which was paid on January 5, 2021, with a portion allocated to the 2020 dividend period, and the balance allocated to 2021.\n102\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nOur consolidated expense (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was as follows:\nThe TRS entities are subject to federal and state income taxes and file separate tax returns.  Income tax expense (benefit) differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to pretax income of the TRS entities, as follows:\nThe tax effects of temporary differences (included in Accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets) are summarized as follows:\nThe net deferred tax liability decreased during 2020 due to sales and depreciation of properties at TRS entities.  The Company believes it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized unless tax planning strategies are implemented.\n103\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe Company’s outstanding debt consists of the following:\nNotes Payable\nNotes payable consist of mortgage loans secured by properties and unsecured public and private debt.  Mortgage loans may be repaid before maturity, but could be subject to yield maintenance premiums, and are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest or interest only.  Unsecured public debt may be repaid before maturity subject to accrued and unpaid interest through the proposed redemption date and a make-whole premium. Interest on unsecured public and private debt is payable semi-annually.\nThe Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants for its unsecured public debt as defined in the indenture agreements such as the following ratios: Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Secured Debt to Consolidated Assets, Consolidated Income for Debt Service to Consolidated Debt Service, and Unencumbered Consolidated Assets to Unsecured Consolidated Debt.  As of December 31, 2020, management of the Company believes it is in compliance with all financial covenants for its unsecured public debt.\nUnsecured Credit Facilities\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had an unsecured line of credit commitment (the “Line”) and an unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”) under separate credit agreements with a syndicate of banks.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Line had a borrowing capacity of $\n1.25\nbillion, which is reduced by the balance of outstanding borrowings and commitments from issued letters of credit.  The Line bears interest at a variable rate of\nLIBOR plus\n0.875\n%\nand is subject to a commitment fee of\n0.15\n%, both of which are based on the Company's corporate credit rating.\nOn February 9, 2021, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which among other items, i) retains a borrowing capacity of $\n1.25\nbillion, ii) includes a $\n125\nmillion sublimit for swingline loans and $\n50\nmillion available for issuance of letters of credits, iii) extends the maturity date to\nMarch 23, 2025\nand iv) includes an option to extend the maturity date for two six-month periods.  The existing financial covenants under the Line remained unchanged.\nThe Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate based on\nLIBOR plus\n0.95\n%\nand has an interest rate swap in place to fix the interest rate at\n2.0\n%, as discussed further in note 10.  During January 2021, the Company repaid in full the $\n265\nmillion Term Loan, and settled its related interest rate swap, as discussed in Note 10.\n104\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe\nCompany\nis required to comply with certain financial covenants as defined in the Line and Term Loan credit agreements, such as Ratio of Indebtedness to Total Asset Value (\n“\nTAV\n”\n), Ratio of Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Asset Value, Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges, Ratio of Secured Indebtedness to TAV, Ratio of Unencumbered Net Operating Income to Unsecured Interest Expense, and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured fin\nancing.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\n,\nt\nhe Company is in compliance with all financial covenants for the Line and Term Loan.\nScheduled principal payments and maturities on notes payable and unsecured credit facilities were as follows:\nThe Company has $\n31.6\nmillion of debt maturing over the next twelve months, which is in the form of non-recourse mortgage loans. The Company currently intends to repay the maturing balances and leave the properties unencumbered.  The Company has sufficient capacity on its Line to repay the maturing debt, if necessary.\nThe Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors, and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.  The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company’s operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.  The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative or other purposes other than interest rate risk management.  The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements.  To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings.  The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.\nThe Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\n105\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe following table summarizes the terms and fair values of the Company's derivative financial instruments, as well as their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nThese derivative financial instruments are all interest rate swaps, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and, as of December 31, 2020, does not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges.\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\nThe following table represents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the accompanying consolidated financial statements:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company expects approximately $\n3.7\nmillion of accumulated comprehensive losses on derivative instruments in AOCI, including the Company's share from its Investments in real estate partnerships, to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months.\n106\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nAll financial instruments of the Company are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in management's estimation, reasonably approximates their fair values, except for the following:\nThe above fair values represent management's estimate of the amounts that would be received from selling those assets or that would be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  These fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs.  However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company's own judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company develops its judgments based on the best information available at the measurement date, including expected cash flows, appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates, and available observable and unobservable inputs.  Service providers involved in fair value measurements are evaluated for competency and qualifications on an ongoing basis.  As considerable judgment is often necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments, the fair values presented above are not necessarily indicative of amounts that will be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.\nThe following financial instruments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSecurities\nThe Company has investments in marketable securities that are included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of the securities was determined using quoted prices in active markets, which are considered Level 1 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Changes in the value of securities are recorded within Net investment (income) loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, and includes unrealized (gains) losses of ($\n3.0\n) million, ($\n3.8\n) million, and $\n3.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities consist of investments in certificates of deposit and corporate bonds, and are recorded at fair value using matrix pricing methods to estimate fair value, which are considered Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  Unrealized gains or losses on these debt securities are recognized through other comprehensive income.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nThe fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.  The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty's nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.\n107\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nAlthough the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.\nThe Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps.\nAs a result, the Company determined that its interest rate swaps valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables present the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nThe following tables present the placement in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis:\n108\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded Provision for impairment of $\n17.5\nmillion and $\n40.3\nmillion, respectively, on one operating property which is classified as held and used.  The property, which is located in the Manhattan market of New York City, was impaired during 2019 as a result of a fair value analysis performed based on lease up expectations after its single retail tenant declared bankruptcy.  As the pandemic continued to impact the leasing market, limiting visibility for replacement prospects for this property, the hold period probabilities shifted triggering further evaluation of the current fair value resulting in the additional impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThe 2019 fair value was derived using a discounted cash flow model, which included assumptions around redevelopment of the asset to its highest and best use as a mixed-use project and re-leasing the space.  The discount rate of\n8.58\n% and terminal capitalization rate of\n4.75\n% used in the discounted cash flow model are considered significant inputs and assumptions to estimating the fair value of the property, which is considered a Level 3 input per the fair value hierarchy.  The 2020 fair value was based on third-party offers for the property and is reflected in the above Level 2 fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also recorded a $\n10.2\nmillion Provision for impairment on one operating property which was classified as held and used and resulted in a fair value of $\n28.1\nmillion.  That operating property is classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020.  The property was remeasured to fair value based on its expected selling price and is reflected in the above Level 2 fair value hierarchy.\nCommon Stock\nof the Parent Company\nAt the Market (“ATM”) Program\nUnder the Parent Company's ATM equity offering program, the Parent Company may sell up to $\n500.0\nmillion of common stock at prices determined by the market at the time of sale.  There were\nno\nshares issued under the ATM equity program during the year ended December 31, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, all $\n500\nmillion of common stock authorized under the ATM program remained available for issuance.\nUnder a previous ATM equity program which expired on March 31, 2020, the Company sold shares through forward sale agreements, which the Company settled during March 2020.  At settlement, the Company issued\n1,894,845\nshares of its common stock, receiving $\n125.8\nmillion of net proceeds which were used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 4, 2020, the Company's Board authorized a common share repurchase program under which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $\n250\nmillion of shares of its outstanding common stock through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.  Any shares purchased, if not retired, will be treated as treasury shares.  The program is set to expire on\nFebruary 5, 2021\n, but may be modified at the discretion of the Board.  The timing and actual number of shares purchased under the program depend upon marketplace conditions, liquidity needs, and other factors.  Through December 31, 2020,\nno\nshares have been repurchased under this program.\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company’s Board authorized a new common share repurchase program under which the Company may purchase, from time to time, up to a maximum of $\n250\nmillion of its outstanding common stock through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.  Any shares purchased, if not retired, will be treated as treasury shares.  This new program is set to expire on\nFebruary 3, 2023\n.\nCommon Units of the Operating Partnership\nCommon units of the operating partnership are issued or redeemed and retired for each of the shares of Parent Company common stock issued or repurchased and retired, as described above.\nIn January 2020, the Operating Partnership issued\n18,613\nexchangeable operating partnership units, valued at $\n1.3\nmillion, as partial purchase price consideration for the acquisition of an additional\n16.62\n% interest in an operating shopping center.\n109\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nGeneral Partners\nThe Parent Company, as general partner, owned the following Partnership Units outstanding:\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation in General and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, the components of which are further described below:\nThe Company established its Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) under which the Board of Directors may grant stock options and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, and other key employees.  The Plan allows the Company to issue up to\n5.4\nmillion shares in the form of the Parent Company's common stock or stock options.  As of December 31, 2020, there were\n4.7\nmillion shares available for grant under the Plan either through stock options or restricted stock awards.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nThe Company grants restricted stock under the Plan to its employees as a form of long-term compensation and retention.  The terms of each restricted stock grant vary depending upon the participant's responsibilities and position within the Company.  The Company's stock grants can be categorized as either time-based awards, performance-based awards, or market-based awards.  All awards are valued at fair value, earn dividends throughout the vesting period, and have no voting rights.  Fair value is measured using the grant date market price for all time-based or performance-based awards.  Market based awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value based on the probability of satisfying the market conditions and the projected stock price at the time of payout, discounted to the valuation date over a three year performance period.  Assumptions include historic volatility over the previous three year period, risk-free interest rates, and Regency's historic daily return as compared to the market index.  Since the award payout includes dividend equivalents and the total shareholder return includes the value of dividends, no dividend yield assumption is required for the valuation.  Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for the entire award.\n110\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe following table summarizes non-vested restricted stock activity:\n111\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\n401(k) Retirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees and permits participants to defer eligible compensation up to the maximum allowable amount determined by the IRS.  This deferred compensation, together with Company matching contributions equal to\n100\n% of employee deferrals up to a maximum of $\n5,000\nof their eligible compensation, is fully vested and funded as of December 31, 2020.  Additionally, an annual profit sharing contribution may be made, which vests over a\nthree year\nperiod.  Costs for Company contributions to the plan totaled $\n3.5\nmillion, $\n3.5\nmillion, and $\n3.9\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“NQDCP”)\nThe Company maintains a NQDCP which allows select employees and directors to defer part or all of their cash bonus, director fees, and vested restricted stock awards.  All contributions into the participants' accounts are fully vested upon contribution to the NQDCP and are deposited in a Rabbi trust.\nThe following table reflects the balances of the assets and deferred compensation liabilities of the Rabbi trust and related participant account obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, excluding Regency stock:\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held in the NQDCP are recognized within Net investment income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Weighted average exchangeable Operating Partnership units outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were\n765,046\n,\n464,286\n, and\n349,902\n, respectively.\nOperating Partnership Earnings per Unit\nThe following summarizes the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per unit:\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in litigation on a number of matters and is subject to certain claims, which arise in the normal course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.  However, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any threatened or pending legal proceedings.  Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations pertaining primarily to chemicals historically used by certain current and former dry cleaning tenants, the existence of asbestos in older shopping centers, and older underground petroleum storage tanks.  The Company believes that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on its financial position, liquidity, or operations.  The Company can give no assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to its shopping centers have revealed all potential environmental contaminants; that its estimate of liabilities will not change as more information becomes available; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant did not create any material environmental condition not known to the Company; that the current environmental condition of the shopping centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; and that changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation will not result in additional environmental liability to the Company.\nLetters of Credit\nThe Company has the right to issue letters of credit under the Line up to an amount not to exceed $\n50.0\nmillion, which reduces the credit availability under the Line.  These letters of credit are primarily issued as collateral on behalf of its captive insurance program and to facilitate the construction of development projects.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $\n9.7\nmillion and $\n12.5\nmillion, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding.\n113\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe following table summarizes selected Quarterly Financial Data for the Company on a historical basis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n114\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\n115\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\n116\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\n117\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\n118\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\n119\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\n120\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\n121\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying report of independent registered public accounting firm.\n122\nREGENCY CENTERS CORPORATION AND REGENCY CENTERS, L.P.\nSchedule III - Consolidated Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in thousands)\nDepreciation and amortization of the Company's investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the statements of operations is calculated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are up to\n40\nyears.
