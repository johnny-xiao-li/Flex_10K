    "text": "Overview\nWe build\nsoftware platforms for large institutions whose work is essential to our way of life. Those institutions must be able to function in times of stability as well as crisis and uncertainty. To do so, they need software that works.\nWe were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism\ninvestigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises.\nWe have built two principal software platforms,\nPalantir Gotham (“Gotham”) and Palantir Foundry (“Foundry”). Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of\nhaystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within\ndatasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.\nWe later found that the challenges faced by commercial institutions when it came to working with data were fundamentally similar. An Airbus\nA350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects.\nFoundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.\nOur software is on the front lines, sometimes literally, and that means so are we. Gotham’s use has now extended beyond intelligence\nanalysis into defense operations and mission planning. And Foundry is becoming the central operating system not only for individual institutions but for entire industries.\nThe stakes are high. The challenges our platforms address are a matter of survival, both for the institutions we serve and the individuals who\ndepend on them. We have the privilege of partnering with some of the world’s most important government and commercial organizations. And we believe that the work of those organizations is essential to our security and the lives that we lead.\nWe are committed to ensuring that our software is as effective as possible without ever compromising our values. Our platforms were built\nfrom the start to protect individual privacy and prevent the misuse of information. We are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data — data that\nthey already have.\nThe same technology that makes our software so analytically powerful — its ability to construct a model of the\nreal world from countless data points — is what allows our customers to monitor, properly secure, and control access to that data and its use. It is also why customers, including governments around the world, trust our platforms to safeguard\ntheir data, including their most sensitive information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our platforms were used by 139 customers, including\nsome of the largest and most significant institutions in the world. For example, the U.S. Army uses our software to ensure the readiness of more than one million military personnel and to make decisions across dozens of command structures.\nSimilarly, our software is deployed by one of the world’s leading auto manufacturers across its factories in North America to help ensure quality control on the production line.\nGotham and Foundry enable these institutions to transform massive amounts of information into an integrated data asset that reflects their\noperations. Users can build on top of this asset to make data accessible and\n5\nactionable. Our platforms enable people, whether they are workers on an assembly line or soldiers in the field, to work with data, even if they have never written a line of code.\nWe have also invested heavily in developing Apollo, our continuous delivery and product infrastructure platform, which is used to deliver\nsoftware updates to our customers and enables our software to run in any environment. The investments in our software platforms have yielded a significant decrease in the time and number of engineers required to install and deploy our software. For\ninstance, the time required to install our software and begin working with a customer has decreased more than five-fold from 2019 to 2020. In some cases, our customers can now be up and running in mere hours.\nOur software is used by customers across 40 industries and in more than 150 countries. Our government work is central to defense and\nintelligence operations in the United States and its allies abroad. On the commercial front, we work with some of the world’s most durable and important companies across industries, including in the consumer, energy, financial services,\nhealthcare, industrials, telecommunications, and transportation sectors.\nWe generated $1.1 billion in revenue in 2020, reflecting an\nincrease of 47% from our revenue in 2019, which was $742.6 million.\nThe scale of our partnerships with customers, in revenue terms,\nhas also grown over time. In 2020, our average revenue per customer was $7.9 million, and the average revenue for our top twenty customers, by revenue generated in 2020, was $33.2 million. This is up from 2019, when our average revenue per\ncustomer was $5.6 million, and the average revenue from our top 20 customers, by revenue generated in 2019, was $24.8 million.\nThe broader momentum of our business is the result of the strength of our software platforms. And the need for software that works has never\nbeen greater.\nThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosion of\ndata privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of\nthese institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.\nOther software companies have incorrectly assumed\nthat the future will look like the past, forming their strategies based on assumptions about a world that no longer exists. A focus on targeted analytical tools and optimizing specific functions within complex organizations is insufficient. We\nbelieve that software must connect the entire enterprise. Our most critical institutions cannot wait a year or longer for a promised application or bespoke solution to be developed. Those options are often obsolete before they are even delivered.\nOur partners need solutions now. And we have built them.\nOur Approach\nWe do not\nsell features, tools, or\none-off\ncustom applications. When it comes to working with data, those approaches generally work only briefly, if at all.\nSome companies throw people at the problem. Others build dashboards. We build software platforms that become part of the institutions we\nserve. And we believe that every large institution in the world has a problem that our platforms were designed to address.\n6\nOur Software Creates a Central Operating System for Data\nOur platforms, Gotham and Foundry, allow organizations to recast their siloed systems as contributors to a unified data asset.\nOur software enables our customers to transform massive amounts of information into knowledge that reflects their world. Data is represented\nnot as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions in context.\nBuilding flexible applications on this data asset allows the data to be made accessible and understandable to the people who need it. We bring\nreal-time operational data to decision makers at the world’s leading institutions.\nOur Software Does Not Displace Existing\nSystems, It Augments Them\nFlexibility and openness are core tenets of our software. By integrating their existing solutions into\nour central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.\nAs the world changes and technology evolves, institutions can adjust their data model and integrate new systems instead of rebuilding\neverything from scratch. Today, our platforms are fully modular, meaning a customer can take what they want of our offering and build on what they have, helping our customers get the unique capability and rapid delivery of value they have come to\nexpect even faster.\nProblems come in radically different shapes and sizes, so we have built software that becomes part of each of our\ncustomer’s environments, whether they’re operating in a Humvee, on an oil rig, or at 30,000 feet.\nOur Approach to\nSecurity Enables Collaboration Instead of Inhibiting It\nOur early days with the U.S. intelligence community informed our\ndevelopment approach. Security is always our first priority.\nWe designed our software to embrace the complexity of security clearances,\ninstitutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. The same technology that allows our platforms to construct a model of the real world from individual data points allows our customers to secure each of those pieces of information.\nSecurity need not come at the expense of collaboration. Our software enables both, and we have a reputation for enabling secure collaboration\nin the most stringent data environments in the world.\nOur Platforms\nWe have built two principal software platforms: Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry. Our software platforms provide the critical\ninfrastructure needed to integrate our customers’ data and operations.\nThe vertically integrated nature of Gotham and Foundry allows\nusers of varying technical abilities to collaborate effectively in our platforms. Data engineers can integrate new data sources, analysts can clean and transform data, data scientists can write models, business users can conduct daily workflows, and\nsenior leaders can make critical decisions. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.\nData, analyses, decisions, and the metadata around each are secured with fine-grained access controls that propagate from source data to\nshared analyses. Each platform is comprised of user-facing applications that are targeted to the specific industries and sectors in which they are used. Images contained in this section are illustrative of our user interface and reflect notional\ndata only.\n7\nDespite their differences, Gotham and Foundry both serve as central operating systems for\nour customers. Where they vary in specific functionality, they align in approach. Both platforms can be deployed in almost any environment.\nGotham\nWe built\nGotham, our first platform, for government operatives in the defense and intelligence sectors. Analysts working on the front lines of counterterrorism operations were hunting for needles not in one haystack but in hundreds and thousands of them.\nGotham enables them to find what they are looking for.\nThe platform enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets,\nranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants. It also facilitates the\nhand-off\nbetween analysts and operational users, helping operators plan and execute real-world\nresponses to threats that have been identified within the platform. Gotham is now used broadly across government functions.\nWe also offer\nGotham to our commercial customers, including to those in the financial services industry in connection with fraud investigations.\nFoundry\nAs we\nexpanded from our government work into the commercial sector, we saw that private enterprises had similar problems to those that affected organizations in the public sector.\nWe also learned that big data isn’t valuable just because it’s big. We believe that the integration and joining of different\ndatasets is what matters most. Data integration also happens to be among the hardest problems to solve.\nWe spent years investing in the\ndevelopment of a platform that makes the task of integrating new datasets routine so that users can focus on taking action on information. The result of that investment is Foundry. All of our commercial customers now use it, as do several of our\ngovernment customers.\nFoundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data. Individual\nusers can integrate and analyze the data they need in one place. The speed with which users can experiment and test new ideas is what makes the software stick.\nData projects often fail because the steps and methods used to build data pipelines are difficult to understand and recreate. We built\nFoundry’s backend to solve the root of this problem. The platform’s graphical interface does the rest, allowing users to track and trace their pipelines so they know what the rows and columns in their tables represent and why they are\nthere.\nCompetitive Strengths\nA number of our most significant competitive strengths, which we believe set us apart from the rest of the industry, follow below.\nWe built privacy controls into our platforms from the start.\nWe embrace the complexity of working in the real world.\nWhere other companies can’t or won’t go, we step in to make sure that critical institutions can do their jobs. We offer software to\nhelp a maintenance engineer decide what maintenance fix to deploy, to help a researcher interpret the results of a clinical trial, and to help a soldier decide when to hold fire and when to shoot.\n8\nAt the same time, we treat the protection of rights to privacy and civil liberties as\nessential requirements for our software. From the start, we built key capabilities for data protection and governance into our platforms. Every capability we ship supports\nend-to-end\ndata legibility, audit logs, granular access controls, data quality checks, and purpose specification requirements that can be adapted to any environment.\nSkeptics may ask how an American software company with roots in the intelligence sector can credibly claim to support the most sensitive,\nregulated, and privacy-conscious institutions in the world. It is because, not in spite, of the fact that we take privacy so seriously — for all our customers — that we have won the trust of institutions whose work relies on safekeeping\ninformation and protecting the data of their constituents.\nOur software engineers are on the front lines.\nOur software is on the front lines, sometimes literally, and that means so are we.\nOur forward deployed engineers (“FDEs”) have travelled to bases in Afghanistan and factories in the industrial Midwest to deploy our\nplatforms. Time in the field adds to the continuous improvement of our platforms. As FDEs help customers make the most of our software, they observe users’ challenges firsthand.\nWe partner with bedrock institutions that are central to the societies we live in, and we help empower them with critical software to carry\nout their essential mandates and missions.\nTime and time again, in wartime and in peace, we have proven our ability to ensure that our\nsoftware addresses these challenges. We learn, we build software, and we deploy that software against problems that other companies are unwilling or unable to address.\nOur software brings government-grade security to industry, and the breadth of private sector experience to government.\nOur roots in the intelligence community and defense sector introduced us to a set of unique challenges when it comes to building software that\nother companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere either did not or could not address.\nOur software had to be secure enough to handle\nnational secrets, stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions, and transparent enough to ensure that all data and usage in the system could be monitored and traced. By building these requirements directly into our platforms, we provide\nthe private sector with government-quality security standards out of the box.\nTo the public sector, we offer software that incorporates and reflects our\nexperience of working across 40 industries and years spent in the field. We incorporate what we have learned into our two platforms, which automatically ship new features to our customers across the business. The breadth of our work provides\ngovernments around the world with something that industry-specific players cannot: automated access to field-driven research and development as well as features built based on the operational needs of nearly every major industry.\nFor example, capabilities of our platforms that were originally developed to help the oil and gas industry optimize production of crude oil\nhave been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize their supply chains in the wake of the onset of the pandemic and by national health agencies in their efforts to allocate personal protective equipment to hospital staff and\npatients.\nSimilarly, features of our software platforms originally designed to handle streaming time-series data from oil and gas wells\naround the world — where a single well can generate more data per day than Twitter — have been applied by other customers to improve the speed of Formula One race cars, maximize usage of airline fleets, and improve quality control on\nautomotive assembly lines.\n9\nOur software platforms deliver multi-tenant cloud economics, even for\nair-gapped\nor disconnected customers.\nApollo, our continuous delivery platform, helps to ensure\nthat our software works wherever our users are and under a variety of conditions: on oil rigs and submarines, on disconnected laptops in Humvees in theater, and on more than 9,000 aircraft around the world.\nOur software is environment-agnostic and is deployed to public and private cloud networks,\non-premises\ndata centers,\nair-gapped\nand classified systems, and on laptops and specialized hardware. This includes AWS Public Cloud, AWS GovCloud, Microsoft Azure, and a variety of classified cloud systems.\nInstead of dedicating a team to manage each installation, a small group of engineers manages almost our entire software footprint, ensuring\nthat the latest features and security patches are deployed across all installations at effectively the same time, independent of the underlying technical infrastructure on which our software operates. This means that we can deploy to\nair-gapped\nor\non-premises\nnetworks at effectively the same rate as we can in the cloud, thereby allowing our customers and us to benefit from multi-tenant cloud economics even\nwith single-tenant disconnected customers.\nOur business is built to expand within organizations and across sectors.\nWe move quickly to scale our partnerships with customers. Our software can support the full range of users in an organization across divisions\nor functions. It also provides a common analytical platform for users across industries and sectors.\nExecutives may set sales targets for\ndata scientists to translate into forecasts. Supply chain managers take those forecasts to plan trade-offs between suppliers, and plant supervisors use their plans to execute production. We can power the entire spectrum of these interconnected\ndecisions, within individual institutions and across them.\nOur software brings diverse decision makers within an organization together:\ndata engineers, data scientists, and machine learning experts, as well as senior executives, prime ministers, and four-star generals. All can, and do, collaborate using our software.\nWe have chosen sides.\nOur software is used by the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.\nSome companies work with the United States as well its adversaries. We do not.\nWe believe that our government and commercial customers value this clarity.\nGrowth Strategies\nWe\nare pursuing a number of strategies to continue to grow the company, in both our commercial and government business segments in the United States and abroad. Our principal strategies are described below.\nContinue expansion into the commercial sector.\nOur current and potential commercial customers are some of the largest enterprises in the world. And we plan to continue expanding beyond our\nroots in the government sector.\nThe work of these commercial enterprises is vital to the lives we lead. We want to ensure that they have\nthe software they need to do their jobs. We also believe that there is significant growth potential for us in the commercial sector, both in the United States and abroad, including in Europe and Asia.\n10\nOur focus in the near term will be to build partnerships with commercial enterprises that\nhave the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations and of their operations — to reconstitute themselves around data. Over the long term, we believe that every large company in the markets that we serve is a\npotential customer.\nIncrease our reach within existing customers.\nFor commercial customers, in sectors such as industrials, energy, financial services, media, and healthcare, our software can generate\nhundreds of millions of dollars, whether in the form of new sales or costs saved. For government customers, such as defense and intelligence agencies, the software promotes the safety and welfare of the constituents they serve.\nThe value that our software creates is what drives our expansion within individual organizations. Our platforms are designed to easily\naccommodate new users, workflows, and use cases. This allows us to rapidly scale within an institution.\nBecome the default\noperating system for data across the U.S. government.\nThe U.S. government is increasingly using alternative procurement methods\nto test commercial solutions, such as the software platforms we have built.\nOur software is well positioned for this new procurement\napproach. Our platforms have been tested and improved over years of use across industries and can rapidly be deployed by the government with minor configurations. This gives us a significant edge over contractors selling custom tools.\nOur lawsuit against the U.S. Army, brought in 2016 and discussed further below, has been a central reason for the federal government’s\nchange in its approach to software procurement.\nExpand our reach with U.S. allies abroad.\nWe intend to pursue significant expansion of our government work with U.S. allies abroad. Recent expansion with law enforcement agencies in\nEurope demonstrates our ability to capture these opportunities.\nWhen ISIS attacked hundreds of people in 2015 and 2016 — in Paris,\nBrussels, Barcelona, and Berlin — our platforms became a key means of communication and information sharing between European intelligence agencies and the rest of the world.\nPursue new methods of customer acquisition and partnership.\nWe are pursuing specific channel-selling opportunities with leading cloud hosting providers that have existing relationships with prospective\ncustomers.\nAs we consider entering and growing in new markets outside the United States, we may continue to enter into additional\npartnerships, joint ventures, and alliances with strategic organizations that operate in our target markets.\nFor example, in Japan we\nlaunched a joint partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc., one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow our commercial and government business in the Japanese market.\nBecome the industry default.\nWe intend to broaden our reach through partnerships that establish our platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.\n11\nThis model has been successfully implemented in aviation, where Foundry now connects the\nindustry’s\nin-flight,\nengineering, and operations data through our Skywise partnership with Airbus.\nWe anticipate opportunities to create similar industry-wide partnerships, such as for healthcare and financial services companies.\nContinue to grow our direct sales force.\nWe are investing in an account-based sales force to identify new customers and opportunities.\nOur decision to grow our sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including companies in the Fortune\n100 as well as a number of leading government agencies in the United States and other countries.\nOur sales force remains relatively\nsmall, at about 3% of our total headcount. We will continue to invest in growing our direct sales force, which we believe will advance our strategies above.\n10 U.S.C. § 2377\nSection 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) is a little known yet path-breaking law.\nFASA was passed with the original intent of addressing procurement waste. The act requires the U.S. federal government to acquire\n“commercial items” for all of its procurements “to the maximum extent practicable.” 10 U.S.C. § 2377; 41 U.S.C. § 3307. That is, rather than pursue acquisition of custom developed items, the government must first\nconsider readily available and proven commercial alternatives on the market.\nThe software we have built is a commercial item within the\nmeaning of the law. A bespoke government solution, custom built by a consulting company, is not.\nLeveling the Playing Field\nAfter its passage in 1994, the law was largely ignored. Government procurement offices paid preferred suppliers for years, if not\ndecades, to develop bespoke software. And commercial suppliers struggled to justify entering the federal market.\nThe regulations involved\nseemed too esoteric, and the market too dominated by incumbents who knew how to maneuver within the system to their advantage.\nInside-the-Beltway\ndefense contractors\nbuilt entire businesses almost exclusively around selling custom technology solutions to the government, many of which we believe failed to achieve their intended purpose.\nPalantir v. United States\nFor years, we struggled to make significant inroads in selling our software to large segments of the U.S. Army. This was despite consistent\ndemand from the soldiers on the front lines for the capabilities our platforms offer. Soldiers from more than half of the Army’s brigades asked for our software, but their requests were often delayed or denied by the government.\nIn 2016, we won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its\nbattlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the ruling and directed the U.S. Army to consider existing commercially available products, whether rifles or software, before trying to\nbuild their own.\n12\nAs our litigation progressed, the Army changed course and began reviewing commercial options\nto serve as part of its intelligence system. After testing real products, including our own, using real data, the Army selected our software to deploy to tactical units across the force.\nFuture Implications\nThe Army, as it works to ensure its service members have what they need to do their jobs, has begun evaluating commercially available\nproducts, such as our software, before turning to custom-built alternatives. Other government agencies have begun to follow suit.\nOur\nvictory in federal court is transforming the procurement of goods and services across the U.S. federal government.\nFor us, this shift in\ngovernment acquisition represents a significant expansion of our potential opportunities with the U.S. federal government. We are working towards becoming the central operating system for all U.S. defense programs.\nOur Customers\nWe work\nwith many of the world’s leading government and commercial institutions. As of December 31, 2020, we had 139 customers.\nAn\noverview of those customers and the ways in which they use our software follows below.\nOverview\nOur software is currently used across 40 industries around the world.\nOf the $1.1 billion in revenue that we generated in 2020, 56% came from customers in the government segment, and 44% came from customers\nin the commercial segment.\nOur business continues to have a global presence. In 2020, we earned 52% of our revenue from customers in the\nUnited States, and 48% from those abroad. The expansion of our business outside of the United States has continued in recent years, particularly in Europe and Asia.\nOur Software at Work\nOur platforms are used by individuals spread across more than 150 countries.\nOur software is in the hands of factory workers, soldiers, clinicians, prosecutors, investigators, claims adjusters, technicians, intelligence\nanalysts, and social workers around the world. It is used by assembly workers in France, pharmaceutical researchers in Germany, public health administrators in the United Kingdom, and special forces personnel and senior military officials in the\nUnited States.\nIndustries and Sectors\nIn addition to supporting individual institutions, our platforms have become central operating systems for entire industries and sectors.\nOur work with Airbus, for example, was initially focused on the production of the A350 aircraft. The deployment of our software soon grew into\nSkywise, our aviation platform that has become the central operating system of the airline industry.\n13\nSkywise connects more than 9,000 aircraft across more than 100 airlines. Decision makers at\neach of these institutions use Skywise to more efficiently design, manufacture, service, operate, and maintain their global fleets.\nSimilarly, when it comes to our work with defense and intelligence agencies, our software is not only used by individual organizations but is\nalso used to enable sharing of information and collaboration across agencies and countries. This is made possible by our software’s access controls, which enable agencies to work on the same platform simultaneously and securely.\nSales and Marketing\nOur\napproach to sales and marketing is built around the first two phases of our business model, as described in the section titled “\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Our Business\nModel\n”: customer acquisition (in the Acquire phase) and account growth (in the Expand phase).\nCustomer Acquisition\nOur customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale,\nhard-to-execute\nopportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the\nlong sales cycles associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition. The larger, more complex, and more technologically demanding the problem, the more likely we are to succeed.\nAcross both the public and private sectors, there is a history of failures when investing in new technologies. One U.S. military department\nspent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.\nMany of our customers have had similar experiences investing millions — even billions — of dollars in digital transformation\nprojects, enterprise data warehouses, and digital twin initiatives that never really worked.\nThese failures have made both software\nbuyers and vendors highly risk-averse. Institutions often doubt that any vendor can implement a working solution and are unwilling to invest. On the other hand, smaller technology companies are often unable to compete for complex, large-scale\nopportunities because installation costs and the risks of failure are too high, and the sales cycles too long.\nThese are precisely the\nopportunities we target. Rather than reject projects with risky and resource intensive installation requirements, we actively seek them out.\nThere are a number of sales and marketing strategies that have accelerated our ability to acquire customers in recent years:\nDirect Sales Force\nWe have invested and\ncontinue to invest in an account-based sales force to identify new customers and opportunities.\nWe believe that our decision to grow our\nsales force in recent years has resulted in multiple new customers that are in the Fortune 100 and include leading government agencies around the world. We will continue to expand headcount in our direct sales force.\nSector and Industry Platforms\nWe are\ndeveloping industry operating systems to help companies and government agencies manage operations across their entire organizations. These operating systems allow our software to be distributed at scale to institutions within given industries.\n14\nFor example, Skywise is our aviation platform that we have developed in partnership with\nAirbus. Our approach with Airbus involves a collaborative\ngo-to-market\nstrategy to distribute the Foundry platform across the aviation industry. The adoption of our\nsoftware has been swift. Since June 2017, Skywise has expanded from zero to more than one hundred airlines on the platform. Each one is now an existing or potential customer.\nWe are working on similar partnerships in the insurance, healthcare, automotive, and government sectors, which we anticipate will have a\nsignificant impact on our business moving forward.\nU.S. Government\nWe intend to capture an even greater share of U.S. federal government spending on software systems, following our legal victory in federal\ncourt. The ruling requires the government to consider commercially available products, such as our software, before attempting to build its own.\nWe generated a total of $51.9 million in revenue from our U.S. Army accounts from 2008 through September 2018, when the federal court\nruled in our favor. Since the ruling, we generated $231.8 million in revenue from those accounts as of December 31, 2020.\nSee the\nsection titled\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Our Business Model — Government Contracts”\nfor a discussion of the terms of our government contracts.\nChannel Sales & Cloud Partnerships\nWe are exploring the development of channel sales partnerships for specific industries and sectors by partnering closely with leading\nproviders of public, private, and hybrid cloud services, which have relationships with essentially every major enterprise in the world and have large, existing sales forces.\nThis channel emerged as an extension of the large computing requirements for our platforms and the migration towards the cloud as the hosting\nenvironment of choice for many customers. The existing footprint of these providers provides us with access to their large customer base and expands our distribution capabilities.\nJoint Ventures & New Business Partnerships\nWe intend to continue to form joint ventures and new business partnerships, where we believe specific industries or sectors require a local\npartner and additional investment in order to realize the full potential of our platforms.\nIn 2019, we announced the formation of\nPalantir Technologies Japan K.K., or Palantir Japan, a Japanese technology company\nco-founded\nby SOMPO Holdings, Inc. and Palantir. We formed Palantir Japan to deploy our platforms across commercial and\ngovernmental institutions in the Japanese market.\nIn 2020, EMD Digital Inc., an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Palantir\nlaunched a joint partnership called Syntropy to accelerate cancer research through secure collaboration within the global scientific community.\nAccount Growth\nThere are a number of\nsales and marketing strategies that we use to drive revenue growth at an account.\nThese strategies include (1) creating new\necosystem partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of its partners and suppliers, (2) selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities, and (3) selling strategic\nimplementations of our software against specific use cases, which deliver competitive differentiation.\n15\nOur sales and marketing strategies allow us to scale existing customer contracts\nhorizontally to include additional divisions or functions within a single institution and vertically to include additional users and user groups. In tackling the customer’s most pressing and challenging problems first, we establish the trust\nneeded to expand platform usage across the full enterprise.\nFor each customer, we evaluate our revenue growth and margin potential on a\ncontinuous basis and seek to allocate our personnel, including our FDEs, to the highest revenue growth opportunities. As long as we continue to see opportunities to scale our revenue base at an existing customer, internal resources may continue to\nbe allocated to that customer even if those allocations reduce contribution margin in the short term.\nResearch and Development\nPalantir was founded on the premise that the most critical challenges cannot be solved from the comforts of Silicon Valley. They can\nonly be solved by working directly with customers.\nAn industry’s problems and strengths are not uniform across institutions. As a\nresult, traditional software solutions can rarely resolve them. Custom code and consulting teams are unsustainable alternatives.\nWe\nbelieve that in order to fully address the most complex and valuable challenges that our customers face, we must experience and understand their problems firsthand. To do so, we embed with our users, from the special forces personnel in forward\noperating bases to oil rig engineers in the field.\nOur FDEs are our first line in identifying research and development opportunities for\nour platforms. By working alongside users, whether on site or remotely, FDEs have a deep understanding of what our customers need, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.\nInstead of hard-wiring those observations into bespoke applications, our developers incorporate them into flexible platforms that adapt to the\nrealities that our customers face. Our software incorporates what we have learned from tens of thousands of front-line hours across the 40 industries in which we work.\nOur direct research and development expenses were $560.7 million and $305.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. We have invested a total of $2.0 billion in research and development since 2008.\nPrivacy and Civil Liberties\nWe are committed to ensuring that our software is as effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to\nprivacy and civil liberties. We have made deep investments to ensure that safeguarding privacy and civil liberties protections remains central to our software and business practices.\nOur platforms were built from the start to protect individual privacy and prevent the misuse of information. We are not in the business of\ncollecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data — data that they already have.\nThe same technology that makes Palantir so analytically powerful — its ability to construct a model of the real world from countless data\npoints — is what allows our customers to monitor and control access to that data and its use.\n16\nPrinciples\nAs we build software to answer questions of increasing significance and complexity, we apply a set of principles at all stages of the\ndevelopment of our software and its deployment.\nCustomer Impact\nSome examples of the ways in which our software facilitates data protection at our customers follow below.\nOur Team\nWe\nemploy a team of engineers, lawyers, and social scientists to ensure that our company remains a leader in the field when it comes to privacy practices and software development.\nThe Privacy and Civil Liberties Engineering team is responsible for ensuring a culture of responsibility around the development and use of our\ntechnology by leading the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, publishing research, consulting with policymakers, helping our customers implement data governance best practices, and facilitating company-wide dialogue on ethical issues. The\nteam is supported by the Palantir Council of Advisors on Privacy and Civil Liberties, a group of independent experts in privacy law, policy, and ethics who help us to understand and address the implications of our work.\nPrivacy-Enhancing Technologies\n17\nCompetition\nWe are fundamentally competing with the internal software development efforts of our potential customers.\nOrganizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms before turning to buy ours. In trying to build something on their own, they\ngenerally rely on a patchwork of custom solutions, outside consultants, IT services companies, packaged enterprise and open source software, and significant internal IT resources.\nIn addition, our competitors include large enterprise software companies, government contractors, and system integrators. We also face\ncompetition from emerging companies as well as established companies that are only now beginning to enter this market.\nThe principal\ncompetitive factors in the markets in which we operate include:\nWhile we believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors, as well as with software developed by customers internally, based on\nthese competitive factors, some of our competitors have greater name recognition,\n18\nlonger operating histories, and larger customer bases; larger sales and marketing budgets and resources and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a\nbroader portfolio of products; broader, deeper, or otherwise more established relationships with technology, channel, and distribution partners and customers; wider geographic presence or greater access to larger potential customer bases; greater\nfocus in specific geographies; lower labor and research and development costs; larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, to make acquisitions, and\nto develop and introduce new products.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,\ntrademarks, trade secrets,\nknow-how,\ncontractual provisions, and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business through patent protection in the United States and abroad; however, we\nare not dependent on any particular patent or application for the operation of our business.\nIn addition, we have registered\n“Palantir” as a trademark in the United States and other jurisdictions. We also have registered trademarks for “Gotham,” “Palantir Foundry,” and our corporate logo, and are the registered holder of a variety of domestic\nand international domain names that include “Palantir,” including, most importantly, “Palantir.com.”\nIn addition to\nthe protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into proprietary information and invention assignment agreements or similar agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. We further control the use of our\nproprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our agreements with customers.\nSeasonality\nWe generally experience seasonality in the timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the timing of the execution of our contracts, as we\nhave historically executed many of our contracts in the third and fourth quarters due to the fiscal year ends and procurement cycles of our customers. See “\nRisk Factors—Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and\nposition.”\nEmployees and Human Capital\nOur employees are critical to the success of our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had 2,439 full-time employees, including 901\nemployees employed outside of the United States. We also engage part-time employees, independent contractors, and third-party personnel to supplement our workforce.\nOther than our employees in France, who are represented by a works council, none of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not\nexperienced any work stoppages due to employee disputes, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\nOur human capital\nresources objectives include recruiting, retaining, training, and motivating our personnel. The principal purposes of our incentive compensation policies are to attract, retain, and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based and\ncash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive\nculture and environment which encourages active dialogue and robust engagement on the issues most salient to employee satisfaction and believe our employees are empowered to play a significant role in shaping the direction and success of the\ncompany.\n19\nAvailable Information\nOur website is https://www.palantir.com, our investor relations website is https://investors.palantir.com, and our Twitter account is\n@PalantirTech.

    "text": "Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties\ndescribed below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by\nrisks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that\nevent, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should consider before investing in our Class A common stock. These\nrisks are described more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks relating to the following:\n21\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred losses each year since our inception, we expect our operating expenses to increase, and we may not become profitable in\nthe future.\nWe have incurred losses each year since our inception as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations\nincluded elsewhere in this filing, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our operating expenses have increased over time. As we continue to expand our business, industry verticals, and the breadth of our operations,\nupgrade our infrastructure, hire additional employees, expand into new markets, invest in research and development, invest in sales and marketing, including expanding our sales organization and related sales-based payments that may come with such\nexpansion, lease more real estate to accommodate our anticipated future growth, and incur costs associated with general administration, including expenses related to being a public company, we expect that our costs of revenue and operating expenses\nwill continue to increase. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may also incur increased losses because the costs associated with acquiring and growing our customers via our Acquire, Expand, and Scale business model\nand with research and development are generally incurred upfront, while our revenue from customer contracts is\n22\ngenerally recognized over the contract term. Furthermore, our sales model often requires us to spend months and invest significant resources working with customers on pilot deployments at no or\nlow cost to them, which may result in no or minimal future revenue. We may not be able to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset increases in our costs of revenue and operating expenses in the near term or at all, which would prevent us\nfrom achieving or maintaining profitability in the future. Any failure by us to achieve, and then sustain or increase, profitability on a consistent basis could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future.\nAlthough our revenue has increased in recent periods, there can be no assurances that revenue will continue to grow or do so at current rates,\nand you should not rely on the revenue of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. Our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute to declines in our revenue growth rate,\nincluding increased competition, slowing demand for our platforms from existing and new customers, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities, terminations of existing contracts or failure to exercise existing options by our\ncustomers, and the maturation of our business, among others. If our revenue growth rate declines, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur sales efforts involve considerable time and expense and our sales cycle is often long and unpredictable.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and unpredictability of\nour sales cycle. As part of our sales efforts, we invest considerable time and expense evaluating the specific organizational needs of our potential customers and educating these potential customers about the technical capabilities and value of our\nplatforms and services. We often also provide our platforms to potential customers at no or low cost initially to them for evaluation purposes through short-term pilot deployments of our platforms in the Acquire phase of our business model, and\nthere is no guarantee that we will be able to move customers from the Acquire phase into later phases. In addition, we currently have a limited direct sales force, and our sales efforts have historically depended on the significant involvement of\nour senior management team. The length of our sales cycle, from initial demonstration of our platforms to sale of our platforms and services, tends to be long and varies substantially from customer to customer. Our sales cycle often lasts six to\nnine months but can extend to a year or more for some customers. Because decisions to purchase our platforms involve significant financial commitments, potential customers generally evaluate our platforms at multiple levels within their\norganization, each of which often have specific requirements, and typically involve their senior management.\nOur results of operations\ndepend on sales to enterprise customers, which make product purchasing decisions based in part or entirely on factors, or perceived factors, not directly related to the features of the platforms, including, among others, that customer’s\nprojections of business growth, uncertainty about economic conditions (including as a result of the ongoing\nCOVID-19\noutbreak), capital budgets, anticipated cost savings from the implementation of our\nplatforms, potential preference for such customer’s internally-developed software solutions, perceptions about our business and platforms, more favorable terms offered by potential competitors, and previous technology investments. In addition,\ncertain decision makers and other stakeholders within our potential customers tend to have vested interests in the continued use of internally developed or existing software, which may make it more difficult for us to sell our platforms and\nservices. As a result of these and other factors, our sales efforts typically require an extensive effort throughout a customer’s organization, a significant investment of human resources, expense and time, including by our senior management,\nand there can be no assurances that we will be successful in making a sale to a potential customer. If our sales efforts to a potential customer do not result in sufficient revenue to justify our investments, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n23\nHistorically, existing customers have expanded their relationships with us, which has\nresulted in a limited number of customers accounting for a substantial portion of our revenue. If existing customers do not make subsequent purchases from us or renew their contracts with us, or if our relationships with our largest customers are\nimpaired or terminated, our revenue could decline, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted.\nWe derive a\nsignificant portion of our revenue from existing customers that expand their relationships with us. Increasing the size and number of the deployments of our existing customers is a major part of our growth strategy. We may not be effective in\nexecuting this or any other aspect of our growth strategy.\nOur top three customers together accounted for 25% and 28% of our revenue for\nthe years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our top three customers by revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2020, have been with us for an average of 5.7 years as of December 31, 2020. Certain of our customers,\nincluding customers that represent a significant portion of our business, have in the past reduced their spend with us or terminated their agreements with us, which has reduced our anticipated future payments or revenue from these customers, and\nwhich has required us to refund some previously paid amounts to these customers. It is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand from our larger customers for our platforms and applications.\nWhile we generally offer contract terms up to five years in length, our customers sometimes enter into shorter-term contracts, such as\none-year\nsubscriptions, which may not provide for automatic renewal and may require the customer to\nopt-in\nto extend the term. Our customers have no obligation to renew,\nupgrade, or expand their agreements with us after the terms of their existing agreements have expired. In addition, many of our customer contracts permit the customer to terminate their contracts with us with notice periods of varying lengths,\ngenerally three to six months. If one or more of our customers terminate their contracts with us, whether for convenience, for default in the event of a breach by us, or for other reasons specified in our contracts, as applicable; if our customers\nelect not to renew their contracts with us; if our customers renew their contractual arrangements with us for shorter contract lengths or for a reduced scope; or if our customers otherwise seek to renegotiate terms of their existing agreements on\nterms less favorable to us, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. This adverse impact would be even more pronounced for customers that represent a material portion of our revenue or business operations.\nOur ability to renew or expand our customer relationships may decrease or vary as a result of a number of factors, including our\ncustomers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our platforms and services, the frequency and severity of software and implementation errors, our platforms’ reliability, our pricing, the effects of general economic conditions, competitive\nofferings or alternatives, or reductions in our customers’ spending levels. If our customers do not renew or expand their agreements with us or if they renew their contracts for shorter lengths or on other terms less favorable to us, our\nrevenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our business could suffer. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations would also be adversely affected if we face difficulty collecting our accounts receivable from our\ncustomers or if we are required to refund customer deposits.\nAchieving renewal or expansion of deployments may require us to increasingly\nengage in sophisticated and costly sales efforts that may not result in additional sales. In addition, our customers’ decisions to expand the deployment of our platforms depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, the\nfunctioning of our platforms, the ability of our forward-deployed engineers to assist our customers in identifying new use cases, modernizing their data architectures, and achieving success with data-driven initiatives, and our customers’\nsatisfaction with our services. If our efforts to expand within our existing customer base are not successful, our business may suffer.\n24\nWe may not realize the full deal value of our customer contracts, which may result in\nlower than expected revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we had been awarded by,\nor entered into with, commercial and government customers, including existing contractual obligations and contractual options available to those customers, was $2.8 billion. Of our total remaining deal value, as of December 31, 2020, $1.5 billion\nwas the remaining deal value of our contracts with commercial customers and $1.3 billion was the remaining deal value of our contracts with government customers.\nThe majority of these contracts are subject to termination for convenience provisions. Additionally, the U.S. federal government is prohibited\nfrom exercising contract options more than one year in advance. As a result, there can be no guarantee that our customer contracts will not be terminated or that contract options will be exercised.\nWe historically have not realized all of the revenue from the full deal value of our customer contracts, and we may not do so in the future.\nThis is because the actual timing and amount of revenue under contracts included are subject to various contingencies, including exercise of contractual options, customers not terminating their contracts, and renegotiations of contracts. In\naddition, delays in the completion of the U.S. government’s budgeting process, the use of continuing resolutions, and a potential lapse in appropriations, or similar events in other jurisdictions, could adversely affect our ability to timely\nrecognize revenue under certain government contracts.\nOur results of operations and our key business measures are likely to\nfluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis in future periods and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below\nexpectations.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including cash flows, have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely\nto continue to do so in the future. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results, financial position, and operations are likely to fluctuate as a result of a\nvariety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the value of our Class A common stock.\nWe typically close a large portion of our sales in the last several weeks of a quarter, which impacts our ability to plan and manage margins\nand cash flows. Our sales cycle is often long, and it is difficult to predict exactly when, or if, we will actually make a sale with a potential customer or when we will be able to move them to the Expand or Scale phases. As a result, large\nindividual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large sales transactions in a quarter would impact our results of operations and cash flow\nfor that quarter and any future quarters in which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed. In addition, downturns in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenue because we generally recognize revenue over the term of our\ncontracts. The timing of customer billing and payment varies from contract to contract. A delay in the timing of receipt of such collections, or a default on a large contract, may negatively impact our liquidity for the period and in the future.\nBecause a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term and require time to adjust, our results of operations and liquidity would suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular period.\nOther factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and financial position include, without limitation, those\nlisted below:\n25\nIn addition, our contracts generally contain termination for\nconvenience provisions, and we may be obligated to repay prepaid amounts or otherwise not realize anticipated future revenue should we fail to provide future services as anticipated. These factors make it difficult for us to accurately predict\nfinancial metrics for any particular period.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, or\nother operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other key metrics for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for\nthese or any other reasons, the trading price of our Class A common stock could fall, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\n26\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and position.\nHistorically, the first quarter of our year generally has relatively lower sales, and sales generally increase in each subsequent\nquarter with substantial increases during our third and fourth quarters ending September 30 and December 31, respectively. We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including:\nThis seasonality has historically impacted and may in the future continue to impact the timing of collections and recognized revenue. Because\na significant portion of our customer contracts are typically finalized near the end of the year, and we typically invoice customers shortly after entering into a contract, we receive a significant portion of our customer payments near the end of\nthe year and record an increase in contract liabilities, while the revenue from our customer contracts is generally recognized over the contract term. While we have historically billed and collected payments for multiple contract years from certain\ncustomers in advance, we have and may continue to shift to collecting payments on an annual or other basis.\nWhile this has been the\nhistorical seasonal pattern of our quarterly sales, we believe that our customers’ required timing for certain new government or commercial programs requiring new software may outweigh the nature or magnitude of seasonal factors that might have\ninfluenced our business to date. As a result, we may experience future growth from additional government or commercial mandates that do not follow the seasonal purchasing and evaluation decisions by our customers that we have historically observed.\nFor example, increased government spending on technology aimed at national defense, financial or policy regulation, cybersecurity, or\nhealthcare mandates may drive customer demand at different times throughout our year, the timing of which we may not be able to anticipate and may cause fluctuations in our results of operations. The timing of our fiscal quarters and the U.S.\nfederal government’s September 30 fiscal year end also may impact sales to governmental agencies in the third quarter of our year, offsetting, at least in part, the otherwise seasonal downturn we have historically observed in later summer\nmonths.\nOur rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue\nto affect our business. We expect that seasonality will continue to materially impact our business in the future and may become more pronounced over time. The seasonality of our business may cause continued or increased fluctuations in our results\nof operations and cash flows, which may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts or meeting or exceeding the expectations of research analysts or investors, which in turn may cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur platforms are complex and may have a lengthy implementation process, and any failure of our\nplatforms to satisfy our customers or perform as desired could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platforms and services are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of network environments. Implementing our platforms can be a complex\nand lengthy process since we often configure our existing platforms for a customer’s unique environment. Inability to meet the unique needs of our customers may result in customer dissatisfaction and/or damage to our reputation, which could\nmaterially harm our business. Further, the proper use of our platforms may require training of the customer and the initial or ongoing services of our technical personnel as well as O&M services over the contract term. If training and/or ongoing\nservices require more of our expenditures than we originally estimated, our margins will be lower than projected.\n27\nIn addition, if our customers do not use our platforms correctly or as intended, inadequate\nperformance or outcomes may result. It is possible that our platforms may also be intentionally misused or abused by customers or their employees or third parties who obtain access and use of our platforms. Similarly, our platforms sometimes used by\ncustomers with smaller or less sophisticated IT departments, potentially resulting in\nsub-optimal\nperformance at a level lower than anticipated by the customer. Because our customers rely on our platforms and\nservices to address important business goals and challenges, the incorrect or improper use or configuration of our platforms and O&M services, failure to properly train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our platforms, or\nfailure to properly provide implementation or analytical or maintenance services to our customers may result in contract terminations or\nnon-renewals,\nreduced customer payments, negative publicity, or legal\nclaims against us. For example, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services may result in lost opportunities for\nfollow-on\nexpansion sales of our platforms\nand services.\nFurthermore, if customer personnel are not well trained in the use of our platforms, customers may defer the deployment of\nour platforms and services, may deploy them in a more limited manner than originally anticipated, or may not deploy them at all. If there is substantial turnover of the company or customer personnel responsible for procurement and use of our\nplatforms, our platforms may go unused or be adopted less broadly, and our ability to make additional sales may be substantially limited, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nIf we do not successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address the needs of our customers, our business and results of\noperations could suffer.\nOur success has been based on our ability to design software and products that enable the integration of\ndata into a common operating environment to facilitate advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration. We spend substantial amounts of time and money researching and developing new technologies and enhanced versions of existing\nfeatures to meet our customers’ and potential customers’ rapidly evolving needs. There is no assurance that our enhancements to our platforms or our new product features, capabilities, or offerings, including new product modules, will be\ncompelling to our customers or gain market acceptance. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate customer demand or if we fail to develop our platforms in a manner that satisfies customer preferences in a timely and\ncost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing customers or increase demand for our platforms.\nThe introduction of new\nproducts and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our platforms obsolete or adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may experience\ndifficulties with software development, design, or marketing that delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new platforms, features, or capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release\ndates of new features and capabilities, and there can be no assurance that new platforms, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims\nby customers brought against us, any of which could harm our business. Moreover, the design and development of new platforms or new features and capabilities to our existing platforms may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that\nsuch investments will be successful. If customers do not widely adopt our new platforms, experiences, features, and capabilities, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment and our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations may be adversely affected.\nOur new and existing platforms and changes to our existing platforms could fail to attain\nsufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n28\nIf we are not able to continue to identify challenges faced by our customers and develop, license, or acquire new features and capabilities to\nour platforms in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may suffer and our anticipated revenue growth may not be achieved.\nBecause we derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from customers purchasing our two platforms Gotham\nand Foundry, market acceptance of these platforms, and any enhancements or changes thereto, is critical to our success.\nThe\ncompetitive position of our platforms depends in part on their ability to operate with third-party products and services, and if we are not successful in maintaining and expanding the compatibility of our platforms with such third-party products and\nservices, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nThe competitive position of\nour platforms depends in part on their ability to operate with products and services of third parties, software services, and infrastructure, including but not limited to, in connection with our joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform\npartnerships, strategic alliances, and other similar arrangements where applicable. As such, we must continuously modify and enhance our platforms to adapt to changes in, or to be integrated or otherwise compatible with, hardware, software,\nnetworking, browser, and database technologies. In the future, one or more technology companies may choose not to support the operation of their hardware, software, or infrastructure, or our platforms may not support the capabilities needed to\noperate with such hardware, software, or infrastructure. In addition, to the extent that a third-party were to develop software or services that compete with ours, that provider may choose not to support one or more of our platforms. We intend to\nfacilitate the compatibility of our platforms with various third-party hardware, software, and infrastructure by maintaining and expanding our business and technical relationships. If we are not successful in achieving this goal, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our\nbusiness could be harmed.\nSince our founding in 2003, we have experienced rapid growth. We operate in a growing market and have\nexperienced, and may continue to experience, significant expansion of our operations. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, a strain on our employees, management systems, operational, financial, and other\n29\nresources. As we have grown, we have increasingly managed larger and more complex deployments of our platforms and services with a broader base of government and commercial customers. As we\ncontinue to grow, we face challenges of integrating, developing, retaining, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in various countries around the world. For example, our headcount has grown from 313 full-time employees as of\nDecember 31, 2010 to 2,439 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020, with employees located both in the United States and outside the United States. In the event of continued growth of our operations, our operational resources,\nincluding our information technology systems, our employee base, or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations and deployments. Managing our growth may require significant expenditures and allocation of\nvaluable management resources, improving our operational, financial, and management processes and systems, and effectively expanding, training, and managing our employee base. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our\norganization as it grows, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be harmed. As our organization continues to grow, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our traditional company culture,\nincluding our ability to quickly respond to customers, and avoid unnecessary delays that may be associated with a formal corporate structure. This could negatively affect our business performance or ability to hire or retain personnel in the near-\nor long-term.\nIn addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our future\nresults of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by\ngrowing companies with global operations in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be harmed.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and\nsenior management, including Alexander Karp, one of our founders and our Chief Executive Officer, and deploy our personnel and resources to meet customer demand around the world, our business could suffer.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive technology industry depends upon our ability to attract, motivate, and retain qualified\npersonnel. We are highly dependent on the continued contributions and customer relationships of our management and particularly on the services of Alexander Karp, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Karp was part of our founding team and has been\nintegral to our growth since our founding. We believe that Mr. Karp’s management experience would be difficult to replace. All of our executive officers and key personnel are\nat-will\nemployees and\nmay terminate their employment relationship with us at any time. The loss of the services of our key personnel and any of our other executive officers, and our inability to find suitable replacements, could result in a decline in sales, delays in\nproduct development, and harm to our business and operations.\nAt times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining personnel with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill positions in a timely manner or at all. Potential candidates may not perceive our compensation package, including our equity awards, as\nfavorably as personnel hired prior to our listing. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be altered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in\na timely manner. In addition, we may incur significant costs to attract and recruit skilled personnel, and we may lose new personnel to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and\ntraining them. As we move into new geographies, we will need to attract and recruit skilled personnel in those geographic areas, but it may be challenging for us to compete with traditional local employers in these regions for talent. If we fail to\nattract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational, and managerial requirements on a timely basis or at all, our business may be harmed.\n30\nIn addition, certain personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and\nsubstantial training in order to work on certain customer engagements or to perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed or unsuccessful, which may negatively impact our ability to perform on our U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment contracts in a timely manner or at all.\nOur success depends on our ability to\neffectively source and staff people with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our customers, including our ability to transition personnel to new assignments on a timely basis. If we are unable to effectively utilize our\npersonnel on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our customers, our business could suffer. Further, if we are not able to utilize the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the\nnumber of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our personnel on customer engagements and could\nincrease our costs.\nWe face intense competition for qualified personnel, especially engineering personnel, in major U.S. markets, where a\nlarge portion of our personnel are based, as well as in other\nnon-U.S.\nmarkets where we expect to expand our\nnon-U.S.\noperations. We incur costs related to attracting,\nrelocating, and retaining qualified personnel in these highly competitive markets, including leasing real estate in prime areas in these locations. Further, many of the companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources\nthan we have. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash compensation that we offer is less attractive than that of our competitors, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled\npersonnel. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to recruit outside of the United States. We seek to retain and motivate existing personnel through our compensation practices, company\nculture, and career development opportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business and operations could be harmed.\nVolatility or lack of appreciation in the trading price of our Class A common stock may also affect our ability to attract and retain\nqualified personnel. Many of our senior personnel and other key personnel hold equity awards that vested or became exercisable in connection with our listing, which could adversely affect our ability to retain these personnel. Personnel may be more\nlikely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options or RSUs have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase price of the shares or the exercise price of the options, or conversely, if the\nexercise price of the options that they hold are significantly above the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, many of our personnel may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Any of these factors could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully build, expand, and deploy our marketing and sales organization in a timely manner, or at all, or to\nsuccessfully hire, retain, train, and motivate our sales personnel, our growth and long-term success could be adversely impacted.\nWe have a limited direct sales force and our sales efforts have historically depended on the significant direct involvement of our senior\nmanagement team, including Mr. Karp. The successful execution of our strategy to increase our sales to existing customers, identify and engage new customers, and enter new U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\nmarkets will\ndepend, among other things, on our ability to successfully build and expand our sales organization and operations. Identifying, recruiting, training, and managing sales personnel requires significant time, expense, and attention, including from our\nsenior management and other key personnel, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the short and long term.\nIn order to successfully scale our unique sales model, we must, and we intend to continue to, increase the size of our direct sales force,\nboth in the United States and outside of the United States, to generate additional revenue from new and existing customers while preserving the cultural and mission-oriented elements of our company. If\n31\nwe do not hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel, our future revenue growth and business could be adversely impacted. It may take a significant period of time before our sales\npersonnel are fully trained and productive, particularly in light of our unique sales model, and there is no guarantee we will be successful in adequately training and effectively deploying our sales personnel. In addition, we may need to invest\nsignificant resources in our sales operations to enable our sales organization to run effectively and efficiently, including supporting sales strategy planning, sales process optimization, data analytics and reporting, and administering incentive\ncompensation arrangements. Furthermore, hiring personnel in new countries requires additional setup and upfront costs that we may not recover if those personnel fail to achieve full productivity in a timely manner. Our business would be adversely\naffected if our efforts to build, expand, train, and manage our sales organization are not successful. We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management\nchanges, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels, and other internal and external considerations. Any future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of\nproductivity, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure and implement the compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive or may not be effective and may affect our revenue\ngrowth. If we are unable to attract, hire, develop, retain, and motivate qualified sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve sufficient sales productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or at all, if our marketing\nprograms are not effective or if we are unable to effectively build, expand, and manage our sales organization and operations, our sales and revenue may grow more slowly than expected or materially decline, and our business may be significantly\nharmed.\nOur ability to sell our platforms and satisfy our customers is dependent on the quality of our services, and our failure to\noffer high quality services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOnce our platforms are\ndeployed and integrated with our customers’ existing information technology investments and data, our customers depend on our O&M services to resolve any issues relating to our platforms. Increasingly, our platforms have been deployed in\nlarge-scale, complex technology environments, and we believe our future success will depend on our ability to increase sales of our platforms for use in such deployments. Further, our ability to provide effective ongoing services, or to provide such\nservices in a timely, efficient, or scalable manner, may depend in part on our customers’ environments and their upgrading to the latest versions of our platforms and participating in our centralized platform management and services.\nIn addition, our ability to provide effective services is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel\nwith experience in supporting customers on platforms such as ours. The number of our customers has grown significantly, and that growth has and may continue to put additional pressure on our services teams. We may be unable to respond quickly enough\nto accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for our O&M services. We also may be unable to modify the future scope and delivery of our O&M services to compete with changes in the services provided by our competitors. Increased\ncustomer demand for support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and expand outside of the United States, we need to be\nable to provide efficient services that meet our customers’ needs globally at scale, and our services teams may face additional challenges, including those associated with operating the platforms and delivering support, training, and\ndocumentation in languages other than English and providing services across expanded time-zones. If we are unable to provide efficient O&M services globally at scale, our ability to grow our operations may be harmed, and we may need to hire\nadditional services personnel, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur customers\ntypically need training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our platforms to maximize the potential of our platforms. If we do not effectively deploy, update, or upgrade our platforms, succeed in helping our\ncustomers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provide effective ongoing services, our ability to sell additional products and services to existing customers could be adversely\n32\naffected, we may face negative publicity, and our reputation with potential customers could be damaged. Many enterprise and government customers require higher levels of services than smaller\ncustomers. If we fail to meet the requirements of the larger customers, it may be more difficult to execute on our strategy to increase our penetration with larger customers. As a result, our failure to maintain high quality services may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nIf we are not able to\nmaintain and enhance our brand and reputation, our relationships with our customers, partners, and employees may be harmed, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity and reputation is important to our relationships with, and to our ability to\nattract and retain customers, partners, investors, and employees. The successful promotion of our brand depends upon our ability to continue to offer high-quality software, maintain strong relationships with our customers, the community, and others,\nwhile successfully differentiating our platforms from those of our competitors. Unfavorable media coverage may adversely affect our brand and reputation. We anticipate that as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing\nour brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand identity and reputation, we may fail to attract and retain employees, customers, investors, or partners, grow our business, or\nsustain pricing power, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Additionally, despite our internal safeguards and efforts to the contrary, we cannot guarantee that our\ncustomers will not ultimately use our platforms for purposes inconsistent with our company values, and such uses may harm our brand and reputation.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed by news or social media coverage of Palantir, including but not limited to coverage that\npresents, or relies on, inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging information.\nPublicly available information\nregarding Palantir has historically been limited, in part due to the sensitivity of our work with customers or contractual requirements limiting or preventing public disclosure of certain aspects of our work or relationships with certain customers.\nAs our business has grown and as interest in Palantir and the technology industry overall has increased, we have attracted, and may continue to attract, significant attention from news and social media outlets, including unfavorable coverage and\ncoverage that is not directly attributable to statements authorized by our leadership, that incorrectly reports on statements made by our leadership or employees and the nature of our work, perpetuates unfounded speculation about company\ninvolvements, or that is otherwise misleading. If such news or social media coverage presents, or relies on, inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging information regarding Palantir, such coverage could damage our reputation in the\nindustry and with current and potential customers, employees, and investors, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be adversely affected. Due to the sensitive nature of our work and our\nconfidentiality obligations and despite our ongoing efforts to provide increased transparency into our business, operations, and product capabilities, we may be unable to or limited in our ability to respond to such harmful coverage, which could\nhave a negative impact on our business.\nOur relationships with government customers and customers that are engaged in certain sensitive\nindustries, including organizations whose products or activities are or are perceived to be harmful, has resulted in public criticism, including from political and social activists, and unfavorable coverage in the media. Activists have also engaged\nin public protests at our properties. Activist criticism of our relationships with customers could potentially engender dissatisfaction among potential and existing customers, investors, and employees with how we address political and social\nconcerns in our business activities. Conversely, being perceived as yielding to activism targeted at certain customers could damage our relationships with certain customers, including governments and government agencies with which we do business,\nwhose views may or may not be aligned with those of political and social activists. Actions we take in response to the activities of our customers, up to and\n33\nincluding terminating our contracts or refusing a particular product use case could harm our brand and reputation. In either case, the resulting harm to our reputation could:\nAny of these factors could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBecause we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue from our platforms and O&M services over the contractual term, downturns\nor upturns in new sales and renewals may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations.\nWe generally recognize\nrevenue from our platforms and O&M services over the contractual term. As a result, a portion of the revenue we recognize in each quarter is derived from customer contracts generally entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline\nin new or renewed contracts in any single quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a decline would negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant\ndownturns in sales or renewals, significant customer terminations, and potential changes in our contracting terms and pricing policies would not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. The timing of our revenue\nrecognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any given period, as revenue is generally recognized over the applicable contractual term.\nOur pricing structures for our platforms and services may change from time to time.\nWe expect that we may change our pricing model from time to time, including as a result of competition, global economic conditions, general\nreductions in our customers’ spending levels, pricing studies, or changes in how our platforms are broadly consumed. Similarly, as we introduce new products and services, or as a result of the evolution of our existing platforms and services,\nwe may have difficulty determining the appropriate price structure for our products and services. In addition, as new and existing competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, or revise their pricing structures, we may be\nunable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. Moreover, as we continue to target selling our platforms and services to larger organizations, these larger organizations may demand\nsubstantial price concessions. In addition, we may need to change pricing policies to accommodate government pricing guidelines for our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and government agencies. If we are unable to modify\nor develop pricing models and strategies that are attractive to existing and prospective customers, while enabling us to significantly grow our sales and revenue relative to our associated costs and expenses in a reasonable period of time, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nIf our customers are not able or willing to\naccept our product-based business model, instead of a labor-based business model, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur platforms are generally offered on a productized basis to minimize our customers’ overall cost of acquisition, maintenance, and\ndeployment time of our platforms. Many of our customers and potential customers are instead generally familiar with the practice of purchasing or licensing software through labor contracts, where custom software is written for specific applications,\nthe intellectual property in such software is often owned by\n34\nthe customer, and the software typically requires additional labor contracts for modifications, updates, and services during the life of that specific software. Customers may be unable or\nunwilling to accept our model of commercial software procurement. Should our customers be unable or unwilling to accept this model of commercial software procurement, our growth could be materially diminished, which could adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nWe have entered into, and expect in the future to enter\ninto, agreements with our customers that include exclusivity arrangements or unique contractual or pricing terms, which may result in significant risks or liabilities to us.\nOur contracts with our customers are typically\nnon-exclusive,\nbut we have historically entered into\narrangements with our customers and our partners that include exclusivity provisions, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. These exclusivity provisions limit our ability to license our platforms and provide services to specific\ncustomers, or to compete in certain geographic markets and industries, which may limit our growth and negatively impact our results. In addition, we have entered into joint ventures and strategic alliances with our customers, as described below,\nwhich also limit our ability to compete in certain geographic markets or industry verticals.\nHistorically, we have in limited\ncircumstances entered into unique contractual and pricing arrangements with our customers, including some that may be outside of our typical scope of business, including arrangements relating to\nnon-cash\nitems.\nWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve\nour competitive position.\nThe markets for our platforms are very competitive, and we expect such competition to continue or\nincrease in the future. A significant number of companies are developing products that currently, or in the future may, compete with some or all aspects of our proprietary platforms. We may not be successful in convincing the management teams of our\npotential customers to deploy our platforms in lieu of existing software solutions or\nin-house\nsoftware development projects often favored by internal IT departments or other competitive products and services.\nIn addition, our competitors include large enterprise software companies, government contractors, and system integrators, and we may face competition from emerging companies as well as established companies who have not previously entered this\nmarket. Additionally, we may be required to make substantial additional investments in our research, development, services, marketing, and sales functions in order to respond to competition, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to\ncompete successfully in the future.\nMany of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial\ncompetitive advantages such as:\n35\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse\nproduct and service offerings and may be able to leverage their relationships with distribution partners and customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages\ncustomers from purchasing our platforms, including by selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling, or offering closed technology platforms. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing provider rather than a new\nprovider regardless of platform performance or features. As a result, even if the features of our platforms offer advantages that others do not, customers may not purchase our platforms. These larger competitors often have broader product lines and\nmarket focus or greater resources and may therefore not be as susceptible to economic downturns or other significant reductions in capital spending by customers. If we are unable to sufficiently differentiate our platforms from the integrated or\nbundled products of our competitors, such as by offering enhanced functionality, performance, or value, we may see a decrease in demand for those platforms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, new, innovative\nstart-up\ncompanies and larger companies that are making significant\ninvestments in research and development may introduce products that have greater performance or functionality, are easier to implement or use, incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed, or implemented or may invent similar or\nsuperior platforms and technologies that compete with our platforms. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources.\nSome of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses that allow them to offer more competitive and comprehensive\nsolutions. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors may be able to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that better address customer needs, devote greater resources to bring these products and services to market,\ninitiate or withstand substantial price competition, or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do. These competitive pressures in our market, or our failure to compete effectively, may result in fewer orders,\nreduced revenue and margins, and loss of market share. In addition, it is possible that industry consolidation may impact customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller or even\nmid-size\nsoftware firms\nand consequently customers’ willingness to purchase from such firms.\nWe may not compete successfully against our current or\npotential competitors. If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take costly actions in response to the actions of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nadversely affected. In addition, companies competing with us may have an entirely different pricing or distribution model. Increased competition could result in fewer customer orders, price reductions, reduced margins, and loss of market share, any\nof which could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur culture emphasizes rapid innovation and advancement of successful\nhires who may in some cases have limited prior industry expertise and prioritizes customer outcomes over short-term financial results, and if we cannot maintain or properly manage our culture as we grow, our business may be harmed.\nWe have a culture that encourages employees to quickly develop and launch key technologies and platforms intended to solve our customers’\nmost important problems and prioritizes the advancement of employees to positions of significant responsibility based on merit despite, in some cases, limited prior work or industry experience. Much of our hiring into technical roles comes through\nour internship program or from candidates joining us directly from undergraduate or graduate engineering programs rather than industry hires. Successful entry-level hires are often quickly advanced and rewarded with significant responsibilities,\nincluding in important customer-facing roles as project managers, development leads, and product managers. Larger competitors, such as defense contractors, system integrators, and large software and service companies that traditionally target large\nenterprises typically have more sizeable direct sales forces staffed by individuals with significantly more industry experience than our customer-facing personnel, which may negatively impact our ability to compete with these larger competitors. We\nhave historically operated with a relatively flat reporting and organization structure and\n36\nhave few formal promotions. As our business grows and becomes more complex, the staffing of customer-facing personnel, some of whom may have limited industry experience, may result in unintended\noutcomes or in decisions that are poorly received by customers or other stakeholders. For example, in many cases we launch, at our expense, pilot deployments with customers without a long-term contract in place, and some of those deployments have\nnot resulted in the customer’s adoption or expansion of its use of our platforms and services, or the generation of significant, or any, revenue or payments. In addition, as we continue to grow, including geographically, we may find it\ndifficult to maintain our culture.\nOur culture also prioritizes customer outcomes over short-term financial results, and we frequently\nmake service and product decisions that may reduce our short-term revenue or cash flow if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and responsive to our customers’ goals and thereby have the potential to improve our\nfinancial performance over the long term. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits and results that we expect or may be poorly received in the short term by the public markets, in which case our customer growth and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe may not enter into relationships with potential customers if we\nconsider their activities to be inconsistent with our organizational mission or values.\nWe generally do not enter into business\nwith customers or governments whose positions or actions we consider inconsistent with our mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies. Our decisions to not enter into these relationships may not produce the long-term\nfinancial benefits and results that we expect, in which case our growth prospects, business, and results of operations could be harmed. Although we endeavor to do business with customers and governments that are aligned with our mission and values,\nwe cannot predict how the activities and values of our government and private sector customers will evolve over time, and they may evolve in a manner inconsistent with our mission.\nWe do not work with the Chinese communist party and have chosen not to host our platforms in China, which may limit our growth\nprospects.\nOur leadership believes that working with the Chinese communist party is inconsistent with our culture and mission. We\ndo not consider any sales opportunities with the Chinese communist party, do not host our platforms in China, and impose limitations on access to our platforms in China in order to protect our intellectual property, to promote respect for and defend\nprivacy and civil liberties protections, and to promote data security. Our decision to avoid this large potential market may limit our growth prospects and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and we\nmay not compete successfully against our current or potential competitors who choose to work in China.\nJoint ventures, channel\nsales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\nWe expect to continue to enter into joint ventures, channel sales relationships (including original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”)\nand reseller relationships), platform partnerships, and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. Joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, strategic alliances, and other similar arrangements involve\nsignificant investments of both time and resources, and there can be no assurances that they will be successful. They may present significant challenges and risks, including that they may not advance our business strategy, we may get an\nunsatisfactory return on our investment or lose some or all of our investment, they may distract management and divert resources from our core business, including our business development and product development efforts, they may expose us to\nunexpected liabilities, they may conflict with our increased sales hiring and direct sales strategy, or we may choose a partner that does not cooperate as we expect them to and that fails to meet its obligations or that has economic, business, or\nlegal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. For example, in January 2021, we entered into a channel sales relationship with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”), pursuant to which we expect IBM to\n37\nsupply a new product leveraging certain components of Foundry integrated with IBM’s Cloud Pak for Data. In addition, in November 2019, we created a jointly controlled entity in Japan with\nSOMPO. We believe this arrangement offers our business strategic operational advantages within the Japanese market, but it also limits our ability to independently sell our platforms, provide certain services, engage certain customers, or compete in\nJapanese markets or industry verticals, which limits our opportunities for growth in Japan and, depending on the success of the entity, may negatively impact our results. Additionally, in 2016, we entered into a partnership with Airbus S.A.S.\n(“Airbus”) that, over time, developed into the Skywise platform partnership, which provides our business strategic advantages but also limits our ability to independently provide our platforms to certain airlines and companies that compete\nwith Airbus.\nEntry into certain joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, or strategic alliances now or in the\nfuture may be subject to government regulation, including review by U.S. or foreign government entities related to foreign direct investment. If a joint venture or similar arrangement were subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might\nlimit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy.\nAs our\njoint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances come to an end or terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace them on comparable terms, or at all. When we enter into joint ventures, channel sales\nrelationships, platform partnerships, and strategic alliances, our partners may be required to undertake some portion of sales, marketing, implementation services, engineering services, or software configuration that we would otherwise provide. In\nsuch cases, our partner may be less successful than we would have otherwise been absent the arrangement and our ability to influence, or have visibility into, the sales, marketing, and related efforts of our partners may be limited. In the event we\nenter into an arrangement with a particular partner, we may be less likely (or unable) to work with one or more direct competitors of our partner with which we would have worked absent the arrangement. We may have interests that are different from\nour joint venture partners and/or which may affect our ability to successfully collaborate with a given partner. Similarly, one or more of our partners in a joint venture, channel sales relationship, platform partnership, or strategic alliance may\nindependently suffer a bankruptcy or other economic hardship that negatively affects its ability to continue as a going concern or successfully perform on its obligation under the arrangement. In addition, customer satisfaction with our products\nprovided in connection with these arrangements may be less favorable than anticipated, negatively impacting anticipated revenue growth and results of operations of arrangements in question. Further, some of our strategic partners offer competing\nproducts and services or work with our competitors. As a result of these and other factors, many of the companies with which we have or are seeking joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, or strategic alliances may choose\nto pursue alternative technologies and develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our platforms, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or\nmaintaining our relationships with these partners, our ability to compete in a given marketplace or to grow our revenue would be impaired, and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful in establishing and maintaining these\nrelationships with our partners, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our platforms or increased revenue. Additionally, if our partners’ brand, reputation, or products are negatively impacted\nin any way, that could impact our expected outcomes in those markets.\nFurther, winding down joint ventures, channel sales relationships,\nplatform partnerships, or other strategic alliances can result in additional costs, litigation, and negative publicity. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n38\nIf we are not successful in executing our strategy to increase our sales to larger\ncustomers, our results of operations may suffer.\nAn important part of our growth strategy is to increase sales of our platforms\nto large enterprises and government entities. Sales to large enterprises and government entities involve risks that may not be present (or that are present to a lesser extent) with sales to\nsmall-to-mid-sized\nentities. These risks include:\nLarge enterprises and government entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle, in some\ncases over twelve months, requiring approvals of multiple management personnel and more technical personnel than would be typical of a smaller organization. Due to the length, size, scope, and stringent requirements of these evaluations, we\ntypically provide short-term pilot deployments of our platforms at no or low cost in the Acquire phase. We sometimes spend substantial time, effort, and money in our sales efforts without producing any sales. The success of the investments that we\nmake in the Acquire phase depends on factors such as our ability to identify potential customers for which our platforms have an opportunity to add significant value to the customer’s organization, our ability to identify and agree with the\npotential customer on an appropriate pilot deployment to demonstrate the value of our platforms, and whether we successfully execute on such pilot deployment. Even if the pilot deployment is successful, we or the customer could choose not to enter\ninto a larger contract for a variety of reasons. For example, product purchases by large enterprises and government entities are frequently subject to budget constraints, leadership changes, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative,\nprocessing, and other delays, any of which could significantly delay or entirely prevent our realization of sales. Finally, large enterprises and government entities typically (i) have longer implementation cycles, (ii) require greater\nproduct functionality and scalability and a broader range of services, including design services, (iii) demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, (iv) sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue\nrecognition, (v) typically have more complex IT and data environments, and (vi) expect greater payment flexibility from vendors. Customers, and sometimes we, may also engage third parties to be the users of our platforms, which may result\nin contractual complexities and risks, require additional investment of time and human resources to train the third parties and allow third parties (who may be building competitive projects or engaging in other competitive activities) to influence\nour customers’ perception of our platforms. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these customers. If sales expected from a large customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe ongoing\nglobal\nCOVID-19\noutbreak has significantly affected our business and operations.\nThe\noutbreak of the novel coronavirus and the\nCOVID-19\ndisease that it causes has evolved into a global pandemic. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of\nCOVID-19,\nwe have\n39\ntaken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and the communities in which we operate, including temporarily closing our offices\nworldwide and virtualizing, postponing, or canceling customer, employee, or industry events, which may negatively impact our business. While the\nCOVID-19\npandemic has provided certain new opportunities for our\nbusiness to expand, it has also created many negative headwinds that present risks to our business and results of operations. For example, the\nCOVID-19\npandemic has generally disrupted the operations of our\ncustomers and prospective customers, and may continue to disrupt their operations, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, uncertainty in the financial markets or other harm to their business and financial results,\nwhich could result in a reduction to information technology budgets, delayed purchasing decisions, longer sales cycles, extended payment terms, the timing of payments, and postponed or canceled projects, all of which would negatively impact our\nbusiness and operating results, including sales and cash flows. We do not yet know the net impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on our business and cannot guarantee that it will not be materially negative. Although\nwe continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance become available, the ongoing effects of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic and/or the precautionary\nmeasures that we have adopted may create operational and other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our field sales, operations and maintenance, and professional services have been conducted in person.\nCurrently, as a result of the work and travel restrictions related to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, and the precautionary measures that we have adopted, substantially all of our field sales and professional services\nactivities are being conducted remotely, which has resulted in a decrease in our travel and office expenditures. However, we expect our travel expenditures to increase in the future, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results\nof operations. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K,\nwe do not yet know the extent of the negative impact of such restrictions and precautionary measures on our ability to attract new customers or\nretain and expand our relationships with existing customers.\nIn addition,\nCOVID-19\nmay disrupt\nthe operations of our customers and partners for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions and/or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurthermore, as a result of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, we are not requiring employees who are able to\nwork remotely to come into the office through at least June 2021. It is possible that widespread remote work arrangements may have a negative impact on our operations; the execution of our business plans; our ability to recruit, train, manage, and\nretain employees; the productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business; and on third-party service providers who perform critical services for us, or otherwise cause operational failures due to\nchanges in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees’ ability to work remotely, it\nmay be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in increased consumer privacy, data security, and fraud risks, and our understanding\nof applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities in connection with the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge,\nparticularly as regulatory guidance evolves in response to future developments.\nMore generally, the\nCOVID-19\npandemic has and is expected to continue to adversely affect economies and financial markets globally, leading to a continued economic downturn, which is expected to decrease technology spending\ngenerally and could adversely affect demand for our platforms and services. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that\nCOVID-19\nwill have on our business, as the impact will depend on\nfuture developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nMoreover, to the extent the\nCOVID-19\npandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this\n“Risk\nFactors”\n40\nsection, including but not limited to, those related to our ability to increase sales to existing and new customers, continue to perform on existing contracts, develop and deploy new\ntechnologies, expand our marketing capabilities and sales organization, generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, and comply with the covenants in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.\nIf the market for our platforms and services develops more slowly than we expect, our growth may slow or stall, and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe market for our platforms is rapidly evolving. Our future\nsuccess will depend in large part on the growth and expansion of this market, which is difficult to predict and relies on a number of factors, including customer adoption, customer demand, changing customer needs, the entry of competitive products,\nthe success of existing competitive products, potential customers’ willingness to adopt an alternative approach to data collection, storage, and processing and their willingness to invest in new software after significant prior investments in\nlegacy data collection, storage, and processing software. The estimates and assumptions that are used to calculate our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the\norganizations covered by our market opportunity estimates will pay for our platforms and services at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecasts, our\nbusiness could fail to grow at the levels we expect or at all for a variety of reasons outside our control, including competition in our industry. Further, if we or other data management and analytics providers experience security incidents, loss of\nor unauthorized access to customer data, disruptions in delivery, or other problems, this market as a whole, including our platforms, may be negatively affected. If software for the challenges that we address does not achieve widespread adoption, or\nthere is a reduction in demand caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions (including due to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic), security or privacy concerns, competing\ntechnologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, or otherwise, or, alternatively, if the market develops but we are unable to continue to penetrate it due to the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our platforms, or\nother factors, it could result in decreased revenue and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe will face risks associated with the growth of our business in new commercial markets and with new customer verticals, and we may\nneither be able to continue our organic growth nor have the necessary resources to dedicate to the overall growth of our business.\nWe plan to expand our operations in new commercial markets, including those where we may have limited operating experience, and may be subject\nto increased business, technology and economic risks that could affect our financial results. In recent periods, we have increased our focus on commercial customers. In the future, we may increasingly focus on such customers, including in the\nbanking, financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, telecommunication, automotive, airlines and aerospace, consumer packaged goods, insurance, retail, transportation, shipping and logistics, and energy industries. Entering new\nverticals and expanding in the verticals in which we are already operating will continue to require significant resources and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful or beneficial to us. Historically, sales to new customers have\noften led to additional sales to the same customers or similarly situated customers. As we expand into and within new and emerging markets and heavily regulated industry verticals, we will likely face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and\nburdens from the governments and agencies which regulate those markets and industries. While this approach to expansion within new commercial markets and verticals has proven successful in the past, it is uncertain we will achieve the same\npenetration and organic growth in the future and our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIn the future, we may not be able to secure the financing necessary to operate and grow our business as planned, or to make\nacquisitions.\nIn the future, we may seek to raise or borrow additional funds to expand our product or business development\nefforts, make acquisitions or otherwise fund or grow our business and operations As of December 31, 2020, we\n41\nhad $200.0 million of term loans outstanding and an additional $200.0 million of undrawn revolving commitments available under our secured credit facility. The principal amounts\noutstanding under this loan will be due and payable in June 2023, and interest payments are due and payable quarterly or more or less frequently in certain circumstances. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms,\nor at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances, debt, and cash\nreceived from our customers. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, we may require additional financing, and we may not be able to obtain\ndebt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise equity financing to fund operations or on an opportunistic basis, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If adequate funds are not\navailable on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to, among other things:\nOur inability to take any of these actions because adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nOur ability to generate the amount of cash needed to\npay interest and principal on our secured credit facility and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our secured credit facility depends on our financial and\noperating performance and prevailing economic and competitive conditions. Certain of these financial and business factors, many of which may be beyond our control, are described above.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital\nexpenditures, sell assets, raise additional equity capital, or restructure our debt. However, there is no assurance that such alternative measures may be successful or permitted under the agreements governing our indebtedness and, as a result, we\nmay not be able to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Even if successful, actions taken to improve short-term liquidity in order to meet our debt service and other obligations could harm our long-term business prospects, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur outstanding debt matures in June 2023. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to refinance\nour indebtedness or obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms or at all, including due to existing guarantees on our assets or our level of indebtedness and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our\nindebtedness. Further, the cost and availability of credit are subject to changes in the economic and business environment. If conditions in major credit markets deteriorate, our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing\non satisfactory terms, or at all, may be negatively affected.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our\nflexibility in operating our business.\nOur credit agreement and related documents, including our pledge and security agreements,\ncontain, and instruments governing any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n42\nAny of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities.\nAny failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our secured credit facility or instruments governing any future indebtedness of ours. Additionally, our credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. Upon a\ndefault, unless waived, the lenders under our secured credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under our credit agreement and\nforce us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a default under our secured credit facility could trigger a cross default under agreements governing any future indebtedness. Our results of operations may not be sufficient to service our\nindebtedness and to fund our other expenditures, and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements. If we experience a default under our secured credit facility or instruments governing our future indebtedness, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, a portion of our cash is pledged as cash\ncollateral for letters of credit and bank guarantees which support certain of our real estate leases, customer contracts, and other obligations. While these obligations remain outstanding and are cash collateralized, we do not have access to and\ncannot use the pledged cash for our operations or to repay our other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions associated with our secured credit facility.\nVariable rate indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur under our secured credit facility will subject us to interest rate risk,\nwhich could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of\n$200.0 million of term indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facility. Borrowings under the secured credit facility bear interest at variable rates, which exposes us to interest rate risk. Our loans under our secured credit facility\nbear interest at LIBOR (or any successor rate) plus 2.75% or a base rate plus 1.75% and are payable quarterly or more or less frequently in certain circumstances.\nWe may acquire or invest in companies and technologies, which may divert our management’s attention, and result in additional\ndilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions or investments.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have engaged in strategic transactions in the past and expect to evaluate and consider potential\nstrategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets in the future. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our products or our ability to\nprovide services. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen risks, operating difficulties and expenditures, including the following:\n43\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities.\n44\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Data Privacy and Security\nIf any of the systems of any third parties upon which we rely, our customers’ cloud or\non-premises\nenvironments, or our internal systems, are breached or if unauthorized access to customer or third-party data is otherwise obtained, public perception of our platforms and O&M services may be\nharmed, and we may lose business and incur losses or liabilities.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to provide effective\ndata security protection in connection with our platforms and services, and we rely on information technology networks and systems to securely store, transmit, index, and otherwise process electronic information. Because our platforms and services\nare used by our customers to store, transmit, index, or otherwise process and analyze large data sets that often contain proprietary, confidential, and/or sensitive information (including in some instances personal or identifying information and\npersonal health information), our software is perceived as an attractive target for attacks by computer hackers or others seeking unauthorized access, and our software faces threats of unintended exposure, exfiltration, alteration, deletion, or loss\nof data. Additionally, because many of our customers use our platforms to store, transmit, and otherwise process proprietary, confidential, or sensitive information, and complete mission critical tasks, they have a lower risk tolerance for security\nvulnerabilities in our platforms and services than for vulnerabilities in other, less critical, software products and services.\nWe, and\nthe third-party vendors upon which we rely, have experienced, and may in the future experience, cybersecurity threats, including threats or attempts to disrupt our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to\nsensitive or confidential information. Our and our third-party vendors’ technology systems may be damaged or compromised by malicious events, such as cyberattacks (including computer viruses, malicious and destructive code, phishing attacks,\nand denial of service attacks), physical or electronic security breaches, natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, personnel misconduct, and human error. Such attacks or security breaches may be perpetrated by internal bad\nactors, such as employees or contractors, or by third parties (including traditional computer hackers, persons involved with organized crime, or foreign state or foreign state-supported actors). Cybersecurity threats can employ a wide variety of\nmethods and techniques, which may include the use of social engineering techniques, are constantly evolving, and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated; all of which increase the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against\nthem. Furthermore, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until after they are launched against a target, we and our third-party vendors may be unable to\nanticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Although prior cyberattacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results, and we are continuing to bolster our threat detection and mitigation\nprocesses and procedures, we cannot guarantee that future cyberattacks, if successful, will not have a material impact on our business or financial results. While we have security measures in place to protect our information and our customers’\ninformation and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, we have not always been able to do so and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to anticipate or prevent security breaches or unauthorized access of our\ninformation technology systems or the information technology systems of the third-party vendors upon which we rely. Despite our implementation of network security measures and internal information security policies, data stored on personnel computer\nsystems is also vulnerable to similar security breaches, unauthorized tampering or human error.\nMany governments have enacted laws\nrequiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving certain types of data, including personal data. In addition, most of our customers, including U.S. government customers, contractually require us to notify them of data\nsecurity breaches. If an actual or perceived breach of security measures, unauthorized access to our system or the systems of the third-party vendors that we rely upon, or any other cybersecurity threat occurs, we may face direct or indirect\nliability, costs, or damages, contract termination, our reputation in the industry and with current and potential customers may be compromised, our ability to attract new customers could be negatively affected, and our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n45\nFurther, unauthorized access to our or our third-party vendors’ information technology\nsystems or data or other security breaches could result in the loss of information; significant remediation costs; litigation, disputes, regulatory action, or investigations that could result in damages, material fines, and penalties; indemnity\nobligations; interruptions in the operation of our business, including our ability to provide new product features, new platforms, or services to our customers; damage to our operation technology networks and information technology systems; and\nother liabilities. Moreover, our remediation efforts may not be successful. Any or all of these issues, or the perception that any of them have occurred, could negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to\nterminate or not renew their agreements, hinder our ability to obtain and maintain required or desirable cybersecurity certifications, and result in reputational damage, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and future prospects. There can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our license arrangements with customers or in our agreements with vendors, partners, or others would be enforceable, applicable, or\nadequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim.\nWe maintain\ncybersecurity insurance and other types of insurance, subject to applicable deductibles and policy limits, but our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all costs associated with a potential data security incident. We also cannot be sure that our\nexisting general liability insurance coverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer\nwill not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the\nimposition of large deductible or\nco-insurance\nrequirements, could harm our financial condition.\nIssues in the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our platforms may result in reputational\nharm or liability.\nAI is enabled by or integrated into some of our platforms and is a significant and potentially growing element\nof our business. As with many developing technologies, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient, of poor\nquality, or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and\nend-users\nof our systems could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. If the\nrecommendations, forecasts, or analyses that AI applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical\nissues. Though our technologies and business practices are designed to mitigate many of these risks, if we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their purported or real impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other\nsocial issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\nWe depend on computing infrastructure operated by Amazon Web Services\n(“AWS”), Microsoft, and other third parties to support some of our customers and any errors, disruption, performance problems, or failure in their or our operational infrastructure could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nWe rely on the technology, infrastructure, and software applications, including\nsoftware-as-a-service\nofferings, of certain third parties, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, in order to host or operate some or all of\ncertain key platform features or functions of our business, including our cloud-based services (including Palantir Cloud), customer relationship management activities, billing and order management, and financial accounting services. Additionally, we\nrely on computer hardware purchased in order to deliver our platforms and services. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of the third parties that we use. If any of these third-party services experience errors, disruptions,\nsecurity issues, or other performance deficiencies, if they are updated such that our platforms become incompatible, if these services, software, or hardware fail or become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions, defects, or otherwise,\nor if they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices (or at all), these issues could result in errors or defects in our platforms, cause our\n46\nplatforms to fail, our revenue and margins could decline, or our reputation and brand to be damaged, we could be exposed to legal or contractual liability, our expenses could increase, our\nability to manage our operations could be interrupted, and our processes for managing our sales and servicing our customers could be impaired until equivalent services or technology, if available, are identified, procured, and implemented, all of\nwhich may take significant time and resources, increase our costs, and could adversely affect our business. Many of these third-party providers attempt to impose limitations on their liability for such errors, disruptions, defects, performance\ndeficiencies, or failures, and if enforceable, we may have additional liability to our customers or third-party providers.\nWe have\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, failures, data loss, outages, and other performance problems with our infrastructure and cloud-based offerings due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions\nof new functionality, human or software errors, employee misconduct, capacity constraints, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, or other security-related incidents, and our disaster recovery\nplanning may not be sufficient for all situations. If we experience disruptions, failures, data loss, outages, or other performance problems, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur systems and the third-party systems upon which we and our customers rely are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic\noccurrences such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, cybersecurity threats, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, public health crises such as the\nCOVID-19\npandemic,\ngeopolitical and similar events, or acts of misconduct. Moreover, we have business operations in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is a seismically active region. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or\nother unanticipated problems at our or our third-party vendors’ hosting facilities, or within our systems or the systems of third parties upon which we rely, could result in interruptions, performance problems, or failure of our infrastructure,\ntechnology, or platforms, which may adversely impact our business. In addition, our ability to conduct normal business operations could be severely affected. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these facilities, it may take a\nsignificant period of time to achieve full resumption of our services, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. In addition, any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand\nand adversely affect our business.\nFurthermore, our platforms are in many cases important or essential to our customers’ operations,\nincluding in some cases, their cybersecurity or oversight and compliance programs, and subject to service level agreements (“SLAs”). Any interruption in our service, whether as a result of an internal or third-party issue, could damage our\nbrand and reputation, cause our customers to terminate or not renew their contracts with us or decrease use of our platforms and services, require us to indemnify our customers against certain losses, result in our issuing credit or paying penalties\nor fines, subject us to other losses or liabilities, cause our platforms to be perceived as unreliable or unsecure, and prevent us from gaining new or additional business from current or future customers, any of which could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nMoreover, to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade\nour systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. The\nprovisioning of additional cloud hosting capacity requires lead time. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and other third parties have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If AWS, Microsoft Azure, or other\nthird parties increase pricing terms, terminate or seek to terminate our contractual relationship, establish more favorable relationships with our competitors, or change or interpret their terms of service or policies in a manner that is unfavorable\nwith respect to us, we may be required to transfer to other cloud providers or invest in a private cloud. If we are required to transfer to other cloud providers or invest in a private cloud, we could incur significant costs and experience possible\nservice interruption in connection with doing so, or risk loss of customer contracts if they are unwilling to accept such a change.\n47\nA failure to maintain our relationships with our third-party providers (or obtain adequate\nreplacements), and to receive services from such providers that do not contain any material errors or defects, could adversely affect our ability to deliver effective products and solutions to our customers and adversely affect our business and\nresults of operations.\nOur policies regarding customer confidential information and support for individual privacy and civil\nliberties could cause us to experience adverse business and reputational consequences.\nWe strive to protect our customers’\nconfidential information and individuals’ privacy consistent with applicable laws, directives, and regulations. Consequently, we do not provide information about our customers to third parties without legal process. From time to time,\ngovernment entities may seek our assistance with obtaining information about our customers or could request that we modify our platforms in a manner to permit access or monitoring. In light of our confidentiality and privacy commitments, we may\nlegally challenge law enforcement or other government requests to provide information, to obtain encryption keys, or to modify or weaken encryption. To the extent that we do not provide assistance to or comply with requests from government entities,\nor if we challenge those requests publicly or in court, we may experience adverse political, business, and reputational consequences among certain customers or portions of the public. Conversely, to the extent that we do provide such assistance, or\ndo not challenge those requests publicly in court, we may experience adverse political, business, and reputational consequences from other customers or portions of the public arising from concerns over privacy or the government’s activities.\nFailure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could adversely\naffect our business.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect proprietary methods and\ntechnologies that we develop under a combination of patent and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in the United States and other jurisdictions outside the United States so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and\nproprietary information and technology. Despite our efforts, third parties may attempt to disclose, obtain, copy, or use our intellectual property or other proprietary information or technology without our authorization, and our efforts to protect\nour intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not prevent such unauthorized disclosure or use, misappropriation, infringement, reverse engineering or other violation of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Effective\nprotection of our rights may not be available to us in every country in which our platforms or services are available. The laws of some countries may not be as protective of intellectual property and other proprietary rights as those in the United\nStates, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property and other proprietary rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual\nproperty. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property or other proprietary information or technology.\nIn addition, we may be the subject of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims, which could be very time-consuming and\nexpensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management’s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages if we are found to have infringed patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other\nintellectual property rights, or breached trademark\nco-existence\nagreements or other intellectual property licenses and could require us to cease using or to rebrand all or portions of our platforms. Any of\nour patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation.\nWhile we have issued patents and patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our\npatent applications or such patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. Furthermore, the patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to prepare, file, prosecute,\nmaintain, and enforce all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. The scope of patent protection also can be\n48\nreinterpreted after issuance and issued patents may be invalidated. Even if our patent applications do issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that is sufficiently broad to protect our\ntechnology, prevent competitors or other third parties form competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage.\nIn\naddition, any of our patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held unenforceable, or circumvented in litigation or other proceedings, including, where applicable,\nopposition,\nre-examination,\ninter partes\nreview, post-grant review, interference, nullification and derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, and such intellectual\nproperty or other proprietary rights may be lost or no longer provide us meaningful competitive advantages. Such proceedings may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable\nto us. Third parties also may legitimately and independently develop products, services, and technology similar to or duplicative of our platforms. In addition to protection under intellectual property laws, we rely on confidentiality or license\nagreements that we generally enter into with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, advisors, vendors, and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that we have\nentered into such agreements with all parties who may have or have had access to our confidential information or that the agreements we have entered into will not be breached or challenged, or that such breaches will be detected. Furthermore,\nnon-disclosure\nprovisions can be difficult to enforce, and even if successfully enforced, may not be entirely effective. We cannot guarantee that any of the measures we have taken will prevent infringement,\nmisappropriation, or other violation of our technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Because we may be an attractive target for cyberattacks, we also may have a heightened risk of unauthorized access to, and misappropriation\nof, our proprietary and competitively sensitive information. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and we may conclude that in at least some instances the\nbenefits of protecting our intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be outweighed by the expense or distraction to our management. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolation of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights. Any such litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could be time-consuming,\nresult in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. Furthermore, attempts to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own\nintellectual property or other rights against us, or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could\nrequire us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nOur success and ability to compete\nalso depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties. Companies in the software and technology industries, including some of\nour current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently pursue litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property\nrights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantial resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Such litigation also may involve\nnon-practicing\npatent assertion entities or companies who use their patents as a means to extract license fees by threatening costly litigation or that have minimal operations or relevant product revenue and against\nwhom our patents may provide little or no deterrence or protection. We have received notices, and may continue to receive notices in the future, that claim we have infringed, misappropriated, misused or otherwise violated other parties’\nintellectual property rights, and, to the extent we become exposed to greater visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation claims, which is not uncommon with\nrespect to software technologies in particular. There may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued patents or pending patent applications, that cover significant aspects of our technologies, or business methods. There may also\nbe third-party intellectual property rights, including trademark registrations\n49\nand pending applications, that cover the goods and services that we offer in certain regions. We may also be exposed to increased risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement,\nmisappropriation, or other violation claims as a result of acquisitions and our incorporation of open source and other third-party software into, or new branding for, our platforms, as, among other things, we have a lower level of visibility into\nthe development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement, misappropriation, or other violation risks. In addition, former employers of our current, former, or future employees may assert claims that\nsuch employees have improperly disclosed to us confidential or proprietary information of these former employers. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, are difficult to predict, could be very time-consuming and expensive to settle\nor litigate, could divert our management’s attention and other resources, and may not be covered by the insurance that we carry. These claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are\nfound to have willfully infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology, branding or marks found to be in violation of a third party’s rights and any necessary\nrebranding could result in the loss of goodwill. We could be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to\npay significant royalties, which would increase our expenses. As a result, we could be required to develop alternative\nnon-infringing\ntechnology, branding or marks, which could require significant effort and\nexpense. If we cannot license rights or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of one or more of our platforms or features, we could lose existing customers, and we may be unable to\ncompete effectively. Any of these results would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, our\nagreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement,\nmisappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platforms, services, or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments\ncould harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers\nand harm our business and results of operations.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, defects or bugs in our platforms could\nadversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nBecause we offer very complex platforms, undetected errors,\ndefects, failures or bugs may occur, especially when platforms or capabilities are first introduced or when new versions or other product or infrastructure updates are released. Our platforms are often installed and used in large-scale computing\nenvironments with different operating systems, software products and equipment, and data source and network configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our platforms or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our platforms.\nDespite testing by us, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new software or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. In the past, errors have affected the performance of our platforms and can also delay the development or\nrelease of new platforms or capabilities or new versions of platforms, adversely affect our reputation and our customers’ willingness to buy platforms from us, and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our platforms. Many of our\ncustomers use our platforms in applications that are critical to their businesses or missions and may have a lower risk tolerance to defects in our platforms than to defects in other, less critical, software products. Any errors or delays in\nreleasing new software or new versions of platforms or allegations of unsatisfactory performance or errors, defects or failures in released software could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur\nsubstantial costs in redesigning the software, cause us to lose significant customers, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. In addition, our platforms could be perceived to be ineffective for a variety of reasons outside of our control. Hackers or other malicious parties could circumvent our or our customers’ security measures,\nand customers may misuse our platforms resulting in a security breach or perceived product failure.\n50\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our platforms and services, or\ndissatisfaction with our services and outcomes, could result in customer terminations and/or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or we may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend\nadditional resources in order to help correct any such errors, failures, or bugs. Although we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard software licensing and service agreement terms and conditions, these provisions may not be\nenforceable in some circumstances, may vary in levels of protection across our agreements, or may not fully or effectively protect us from such claims and related liabilities and costs. We generally provide a warranty for our software products and\nservices and an SLA for our performance of software operations via our O&M services to customers. In the event that there is a failure of warranties in such agreements, we are generally obligated to correct the product or service to conform to\nthe warranty provision as set forth in the applicable SLA, or, if we are unable to do so, the customer is entitled to seek a refund of the purchase price of the product and service (generally prorated over the contract term). The sale and support of\nour products also entail the risk of product liability claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us. In\naddition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management’s time and other resources.\nIn addition, our platforms integrate a wide variety of other elements, and our platforms must successfully interoperate with products from\nother vendors and our customers’ internally developed software. As a result, when problems occur for a customer using our platforms, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems, and we may receive blame for a security, access\ncontrol, or other compliance breach that was the result of the failure of one of other elements in a customer’s or another vendor’s IT, security, or compliance infrastructure. The occurrence of software or errors in data, whether or not\ncaused by our platforms, could delay or reduce market acceptance of our platforms and have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance, and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any\nsuch problems could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If an actual or perceived breach of information correctness, auditability, integrity, or availability occurs in one of our customers’ systems, regardless of\nwhether the breach is attributable to our platforms, the market perception of the effectiveness of our platforms could be harmed. Alleviating any of these problems could require additional significant expenditures of our capital and other resources\nand could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nWe rely on the availability of licenses to third-party technology that may be difficult to replace or that may cause errors or\ndelay implementation of our platforms and services should we not be able to continue or obtain a commercially reasonable license to such technology.\nOur platforms include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to renew licenses\nrelating to various aspects of these platforms or to seek new licenses for existing or new platforms or other products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Third\nparties may terminate their licenses with us for a variety of reasons, including actual or perceived failures or breaches of security or privacy, or reputational concerns, or they may choose not to renew their licenses with us. In addition, we may\nbe subject to liability if third-party software that we license is found to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate intellectual property or privacy rights of others. The loss of, or inability to obtain, certain third-party licenses or other\nrights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could result in product roll-backs, delays in product releases until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or\ndeveloped, if at all, and integrated into our platforms, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, the inclusion in our platforms of software or other intellectual property\nlicensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our platforms from products of our competitors and could inhibit our ability to provide the current level of service to existing customers.\n51\nIn addition, any data that we license from third parties for potential use in our platforms\nmay contain errors or defects, which could negatively impact the analytics that our customers perform on or with such data. This may have a negative impact on how our platforms are perceived by our current and potential customers and could\nmaterially damage our reputation and brand.\nChanges in or the loss of third-party licenses could lead to our platforms becoming\ninoperable or the performance of our platforms being materially reduced resulting in our potentially needing to incur additional research and development costs to ensure continued performance of our platforms or a material increase in the costs of\nlicensing, and we may experience decreased demand for our platforms.\nOur platforms contain “open source” software, and\nany failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nOur\nplatforms are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under “open source” licenses. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we\ncreate based upon the open source software, and that we license these modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third-parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain provisions of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software. In addition to risks related to license\nrequirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide updates, warranties, support, indemnities, assurances of title, or controls on\norigin of the software. Likewise, some open source projects have known security and other vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities, or are otherwise subject to security attacks due to their wide availability, and are provided on an\n“as-is”\nbasis. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organization for the use of open source software, and the\nuse of software tools to review our source code for open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our platforms or that such software tools will be effective. In addition, open\nsource license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open\nsource software, we may be required to\nre-engineer\nour platforms, to release proprietary source code, to discontinue the sale of our platforms in the event\nre-engineering\ncould not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. In addition, if the open source software we use is no longer maintained by the relevant open source community, then it may be more difficult to make the necessary revisions to our\nsoftware, including modifications to address security vulnerabilities, which could impact our ability to mitigate cybersecurity risks or fulfill our contractual obligations to our customers. We may also face claims from others seeking to enforce the\nterms of an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. Such claims, with or without merit, could result in litigation,\ncould be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigation, could divert our management’s attention and other resources, could require us to lease some of our proprietary code, or could require us to devote additional research and\ndevelopment resources to change our software, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, we have intentionally made\ncertain proprietary software available on an open source basis, both by contributing modifications back to existing open source projects, and by making certain internally developed tools available pursuant to open source licenses, and we plan to\ncontinue to do so in the future. While we have established procedures, including a review process for any such contributions, which is designed to protect any code that may be competitively sensitive, we cannot guarantee that this process has always\nbeen applied consistently. Even when applied, because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such software source code may be\nlimited or lost entirely, and we may be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such\n52\ncontributed software source code for competitive purposes, or for commercial or other purposes beyond what we intended.\nMany of these risks associated with usage of open source software could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and could, if not properly\naddressed, negatively affect the performance of our offerings and our business.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Accounting\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\nlaws and regulations\nregarding privacy, data protection and security, technology protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary\npenalties, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, national,\nand international laws and directives and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy and data protection, data security, data storage, retention, transfer and deletion, technology\nprotection, and personal information. Foreign data protection, data security, privacy, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign\nlaws and regulations, which, depending on the regime, may be enforced by private parties or government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change, and they are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In\naddition, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving software and technology industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\ninconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. A number of proposals are pending before U.S. federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our\nbusiness. For example, ongoing legal challenges in Europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to certain other jurisdictions, including the United States, could result in further limitations\non the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that permit cross-border data transfers. The California state legislature passed the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (“CCPA”) in 2018 and California voters approved a ballot measure subsequently establishing the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) in 2020, which will jointly regulate the processing of personal information of\nCalifornia residents and increase the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of California residents, including requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and affords\nsuch consumers new abilities to\nopt-out\nof certain sales of personal information. The CCPA came into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may bring enforcement actions, with\npenalties for violations of the CCPA. The CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023 instilling enforcement authority in a new dedicated regulatory body, the California Privacy Protection Agency, which will begin carrying out enforcement\nactions as soon as six months after the enactment date. While aspects of both the CCPA and CPRA and their interpretations remain to be determined in practice, we are committed to complying with their obligations. We cannot yet fully predict the\nimpact of the CCPA and CPRA on our business or operations, but developments regarding these and all privacy and data protection laws and regulations around the world may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur\nsubstantial costs and expenses in an effort to maintain compliance on an ongoing basis. Outside of the United States, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own legal framework relating to privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security matters with which we and/or our customers must comply. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, retention, disclosure, security, transfer, and other processing of data that\nidentifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual. Some countries and regions, including the European Union, are considering or have passed legislation that imposes significant obligations in connection with privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our platforms and services, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which took effect in May 2018. Complying with the GDPR or other\ndata protection laws and regulations as they emerge may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to modify our data handling practices on\n53\nan ongoing basis.\nNon-compliance\nwith the GDPR specifically may result in administrative fines or monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide annual\nrevenue in the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements, and could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or other related parties and may otherwise adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe overarching complexity of privacy and data protection laws and\nregulations around the world pose a compliance challenge that could manifest in costs, damages, or liability in other forms as a result of failure to implement proper programmatic controls, failure to adhere to those controls, or the malicious or\ninadvertent breach of applicable privacy and data protection requirements by us, our employees, our business partners, or our customers.\nIn addition to government regulation, self-regulatory standards and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, be\nargued to apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards or to facilitate our customers’ compliance with such standards. Because privacy, data protection, and information security are critical competitive factors in our industry, we\nmay make statements on our website, in marketing materials, or in other settings about our data security measures and our compliance with, or our ability to facilitate our customers’ compliance with, these standards. We also expect that there\nwill continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection, and information security, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards, or amendments to or\nre-interpretations\nof existing laws and regulations, industry standards, or other obligations may have on our business. New laws, amendments to or\nre-interpretations\nof\nexisting laws and regulations, industry standards, and contractual and other obligations may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. As these legal regimes relating to privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity continue to evolve, they may result in ever-increasing public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Furthermore, because the interpretation and application of laws, standards, contractual obligations and other\nobligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security are uncertain, these laws, standards, and contractual and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is, or is alleged to be, inconsistent with our\ndata management practices, our policies or procedures, or the features of our platforms, or we may simply fail to properly develop or implement our practices, policies, procedures, or features in compliance with such obligations. If so, in addition\nto the possibility of fines, lawsuits, and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our platforms, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to make such\nchanges and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to fulfill existing obligations, make enhancements, or develop new platforms and features could be limited. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other\nburdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platforms.\nThese existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can make our platforms and services less effective or\nvaluable, delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require us to modify our data handling practices, limit our operations, impose substantial fines and penalties, require\nsignificant management time and attention, or put our data or technology at risk. Any failure or perceived failure by us or our platforms to comply with the laws, regulations, directives, policies, industry standards, or legal obligations of the\nU.S., European Union, or other governmental or\nnon-governmental\nbodies at the regional, national, or supra-national level relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, or any security incident\nthat results in actual or suspected loss of or the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, use, release, or transfer of, personal information, personal data, or other customer or sensitive data sensitive data or information may result in\ngovernmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and prosecutions, private claims and litigation, indemnification or other contractual obligations, other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business\npractices, or adverse publicity, and related costs and liabilities, which could significantly and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n54\nOur\nnon-U.S.\nsales and operations subject us\nto additional risks and regulations that can adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur successes to date have primarily\ncome from customers in relatively stable and developed countries, but we are in the process of entering new and emerging markets in\nnon-U.S.\ncountries, including with\nCOVID-19\nresponse efforts and defense, law enforcement, national security, and other government agencies, as part of our growth strategy. These new and emerging markets may involve uncertain business,\ntechnology, and economic risks and may be difficult or impossible for us to penetrate, even if we were to commit significant resources to do so.\nWe currently have sales personnel and sales and services operations in the United States and certain countries around the world. To the extent\nthat we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, or retaining\nnon-U.S.\nstaff, and specifically sales management and sales personnel staff, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity\nin, or market penetration of,\nnon-U.S.\nmarkets. Our ability to convince customers to expand their use of our platforms or renew their subscription, license, or maintenance and service agreements with us is\ncorrelated to, among other things, our direct engagement with the customer. To the extent we are restricted or unable to engage with\nnon-U.S.\ncustomers effectively with our limited sales force and services\ncapacity, we may be unable to grow sales to existing customers to the same degree we have experienced in the United States.\nOur\nnon-U.S.\noperations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:\n55\nIn addition to the factors above, foreign\ngovernments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to sell our platforms in certain countries. For example, foreign governments may require a percentage of prime contracts be\nfulfilled by local contractors or provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours. Moreover, both the U.S. government and foreign governments may regulate the\nacquisition of or import of our technologies or our entry into certain foreign markets or partnership with foreign third parties through investment screening or other regulations. Such regulations may apply to certain\nnon-U.S.\njoint ventures, platform partnerships and strategic alliances that may be integral to our long-term business strategy.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our\nnon-U.S.\noperations increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to investigations, sanctions,\nenforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, or other collateral consequences. In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our\ninternal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. In addition, although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, partners, or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting\nmisstatements, governmental sanctions, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our platforms. In addition, responding to any action may result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources\nand an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions or failure to prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, we are expanding operations, including our work with existing commercial customers, into countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and\nelsewhere, which may place restrictions on the transfer of data and potentially the import and use of foreign encryption technology. Any of these risks could harm our\nnon-U.S.\noperations and reduce our\nnon-U.S.\nsales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nSome of our business partners also have\nnon-U.S.\noperations and are subject to the risks described\nabove. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of our own\nnon-U.S.\noperations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\n56\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business, and\nwe have been, and expect to be, the subject of legal and regulatory inquiries, which may result in monetary payments or may otherwise negatively impact our reputation, business, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in which we operate. In certain jurisdictions,\nthe regulatory requirements imposed by foreign governments may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, administrative proceedings, sanctions,\nenforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, litigation, civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, exclusion from sales channels or sales opportunities, injunctions, or other consequences. Such matters may include, but\nare not limited to, claims, disputes, allegations, or investigations related to alleged violations of laws or regulations relating to anti-corruption requirements, lobbying or\nconflict-of-interest\nrequirements, export or other trade controls, data privacy or data protection requirements, or laws or regulations relating to employment,\nprocurement, cybersecurity, securities, or antitrust/competition requirements. The effects of recently imposed and proposed actions are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental action and responses. We may be subject to government\ninquiries that drain our time and resources, tarnish our brand among customers and potential customers, prevent us from doing business with certain customers or markets, including government customers, affect our ability to hire, attract and\nmaintain qualified employees, or require us to take remedial action or pay penalties. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from governmental agencies and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations or\notherwise relating to our business or transactions. Any negative outcome from such inquiries or investigations or failure to prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and growth prospects.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, involved in a number of legal,\nregulatory, and administrative inquiries and proceedings, and unfavorable outcomes in litigation or other of these matters could negatively impact our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nWe are currently, and may, from time to time, be involved in and subject to litigation or proceedings for a variety of claims or disputes, and\nwe may have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to regulatory inquiries. These claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could involve labor and employment, discrimination and harassment, commercial disputes, intellectual property rights\n(including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other proprietary rights), class actions, general contract, tort, defamation, data privacy rights, antitrust, common law fraud, government regulation, or compliance, alleged federal and\nstate securities and “blue sky” law violations or other investor claims, and other matters. Derivative claims, lawsuits, and proceedings, which may, from time to time, be asserted against our directors by our stockholders, could involve\nbreach of fiduciary duty, failure of oversight, corporate waste claims, and other matters. One of our stockholders with respect to whom we are currently engaged in litigation as described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements has\nthreatened to bring various of these claims. In addition, our business and results may be adversely affected by the outcome of currently pending and any future legal, regulatory, and/or administrative claims or proceedings, including through\nmonetary damages or injunctive relief.\nThe number and significance of our legal disputes and inquiries may increase as we continue to\ngrow larger, as our business has expanded in employee headcount, scope, and geographic reach, and as our platforms and services have become more complex. Additionally, if customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be\nadversely affected due to the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts through litigation. Litigation or other proceedings can be expensive and time consuming and can divert our resources and leadership’s attention from our primary business\noperations. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to prevail in litigation, we could incur payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our platforms or business\npractices, and accordingly, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, if we accrue a loss contingency for pending litigation and determine that it is probable, any\ndisclosures, estimates, and reserves we\n57\nreflect in our financial statements with regard to these matters may not reflect the ultimate disposition or financial impact of litigation or other such matters. These proceedings could also\nresult in negative publicity, which could harm customer and public perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are\ninvolved in is described further in\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\nin our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nAs we operate and sell our platforms and services around the world, we are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n(“FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the United States Travel Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do\nbusiness, both domestic and abroad. These laws and regulations generally prohibit improper payments or offers of improper payments to government officials, political parties, or commercial partners for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business\nor securing an improper business advantage.\nWe have operations, deal with and make sales to governmental or quasi-governmental entities\nin the United States and in\nnon-U.S.\ncountries, including those known to experience corruption, particularly certain emerging countries in East Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa, South America, and the Middle East,\nand further expansion of our\nnon-U.S.\nsales efforts may involve additional regions.\nCorruption\nissues pose a risk in every country and jurisdiction, but in many countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be more common for businesses to engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws\nand regulations, and our activities in these countries pose a heightened risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or third-party business partners, representatives, and agents that could be in violation of various\nlaws including the FCPA. The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for acts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents. We\nand our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other\nillegal activities of our employees or such third parties even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. The FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal\ncontrols and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have implemented policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees or other third parties working on our behalf\nwill not engage in conduct in violation of our policies or applicable law for which we might ultimately be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA, the UK Bribery act, and other laws may result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage,\ninvestigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, as well as severe criminal or civil sanctions, including suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting, and we may be subject to other liabilities and\nadverse effects on our reputation, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of\nmanagement’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Our exposure for violating these laws increases as our\nnon-U.S.\npresence expands and as we increase sales\nand operations in foreign jurisdictions.\nGovernmental trade controls, including export and import controls, sanctions, customs\nrequirements, and related regimes, could subject us to liability or loss of contracting privileges or limit our ability to compete in certain markets.\nOur offerings are subject to U.S. export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our offerings. Our controlled\nsoftware offerings and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the\n58\nUnited States only with the required export authorizations, which may include license requirements in some circumstances. Additionally, our current or future products may be classified under the\nCommerce Department Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) or as defense articles subject to the United States International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). Most of our products, including our core software platforms,\nhave been classified under the EAR and are generally exportable without needing a specific license, under an EAR exception for encrypted software. If a product, or component of a product, is classified under the ITAR, or is ineligible for the EAR\nencryption exception, then those products could be exported outside the United States only if we obtain the applicable export license or qualify for a different license exception. In certain contexts, the services we provide might be classified as\ndefense services subject to the ITAR separately from the products we provide. Compliance with the EAR, ITAR, and other applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products, including new releases of our products and/or the\nperformance of services, may create delays in the introduction of our products in\nnon-U.S.\nmarkets, prevent our customers with\nnon-U.S.\noperations from deploying our\nproducts throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether.\nFurthermore,\nour activities are subject to the economic sanctions, laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Such controls prohibit the shipment or transfer of certain products and services without the required export authorizations or\nexport to countries, governments, and persons targeted by applicable sanctions. We take precautions to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including: (i) seeking to proactively classify our platforms and obtain\nauthorizations for the export and/or import of our platforms where appropriate, (ii) implementing certain technical controls and screening practices to reduce the risk of violations, and (iii) requiring compliance with U.S. export control\nand sanctions obligations in customer and vendor contracts. However, we cannot guarantee the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws.\nAs discussed above, if we misclassify a product or service, export or provide access to a product or service in violation of applicable\nrestrictions, or otherwise fail to comply with export regulations, we may be denied export privileges or subjected to significant per violation fines or other penalties, and our platforms may be denied entry into other countries. Any decreased use\nof our platforms or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platforms would likely adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or\npenalties, including civil penalties of over $300,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, per EAR violation and a civil penalty of over $1,000,000 for ITAR violations. In the event of criminal knowing and willful violations\nof these laws, fines of up to $1,000,000 per violation and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers could be imposed.\nWe also note that if we or our business partners or counterparties, including licensors and licensees, prime contractors, subcontractors,\nsublicensors, vendors, customers, shipping partners, or contractors, fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or\nre-export\nlicenses or permits, notwithstanding regulatory requirements or contractual\ncommitments to do so, or if we fail to secure such contractual commitments where necessary, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties. For\ninstance, violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties, including significant civil and criminal penalties per violation, depending on the circumstances of the violation or violations.\nNegative consequences for violations or apparent violations of trade control requirements may include the absolute loss of the right to sell\nour platforms or services to the government of the United States, or to other public bodies, or a reduction in our ability to compete for such sales opportunities. Further, complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular\nsale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nAlso, various countries, in addition to the United\nStates, regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that\n59\ncould limit our ability to distribute our platforms or could limit our customers’ abilities to implement our platforms in those countries. Any new export restrictions, new legislation,\nchanges in economic sanctions, or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platforms by existing\ncustomers with\nnon-U.S.\noperations, declining adoption of our platforms by new customers with\nnon-U.S.\noperations, limitation of our expansion into new markets, and\ndecreased revenue.\nChanges in accounting principles or their application to us could result in unfavorable accounting charges or\neffects, which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe prepare consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In particular, we make certain estimates and assumptions related to the adoption and interpretation of these principles including the recognition of our\nrevenue and the accounting of our stock-based compensation expense with respect to our financial statements. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, our financial results and position could materially differ from our expectations and could be\nmaterially adversely affected. A change in any of these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations or application to us, may have a significant effect on our reported results, as well as our processes and related controls, and may\nretroactively affect previously reported results or our forecasts, which may negatively impact our financial statements.\nFor example,\nrecent new standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board could materially impact our financial statements, including Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842 (“ASC 842”),\nLeases,\nwhich we adopted during the year\nended December 31, 2020\n.\nThe adoption of this new standard required enhancements to, and changes in our processes and systems, and may require significant additional time and cost on behalf of our financial management. This may in turn\nadversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf our judgments or estimates relating to our critical accounting\npolicies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the\nsection titled\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and\nthe amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our\nresults of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock. Significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in preparing our\nconsolidated financial statements include, or may in the future include, those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Determining our provision for income\ntaxes requires significant management judgment, and the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain. In addition, our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by many factors, including, among other things,\nchanges to our operating or holding structure, changes in the amounts of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws. Tax\nauthorities in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions may disagree with our calculation of research and development tax credits, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, or other matters and assess additional taxes, interest or penalties.\nWhile we\n60\nregularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and we believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to\ncover any such contingencies, there can be no assurance that the outcomes of such examinations will not have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our\noverall taxes could increase, and our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to\nutilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carry-forwards and tax credits, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe record an asset for the future tax benefits from unused U.S. federal and state net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits\nsubject to a full valuation allowance. Federal, state and foreign taxing bodies often place limitations on NOLs and tax credit carryforward benefits. As a result, we may not be able to utilize the net operating and tax credit assets reflected on our\nbalance sheet. In general, under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its\npre-change\nNOLs to offset future taxable income. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. If our\nexisting NOLs are subject to limitations arising from an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be limited by Section 382 of the Code, and a certain amount of our prior year NOLs could expire without benefit. Changes in the law may\nalso impact our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nThere is also a risk that the expiration of our\nexisting net operating losses or tax credits or a limitation on their use to offset future income tax liabilities could result from statutory or regulatory changes, especially in reaction to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic.\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our license\narrangements in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.\nStates and some local taxing jurisdictions have differing\nrules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We collect and remit U.S. sales and use tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), and goods and\nservices tax (“GST”) in a number of jurisdictions. It is possible, however, that we could face sales tax, VAT, or GST audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as state tax authorities could still assert that\nwe are obligated to collect additional tax amounts from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits in states and\nnon-U.S.\njurisdictions for which we have not\naccrued tax liabilities. One or more states or countries may seek to impose incremental or new sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us or may determine that such taxes should have, but have not been, paid by us.\nRelationships and Business with the Public Sector\nA significant portion of our business depends on sales to the public sector, and our failure to receive and maintain government contracts\nor changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe\nderive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and government agencies, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement\nof government contracts. For example, we have historically derived, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from sales to agencies of the U.S. federal government, either directly by us or through other government\ncontractors. Our perceived relationship with the U.S. government could adversely affect our business prospects in certain\nnon-U.S.\ngeographies or with certain\nnon-U.S.\ngovernments.\nSales to such government agencies are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to government agencies can be\nhighly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and\n61\nexpense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. We also must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts, which\nprovide public sector customers rights, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts.\nAccordingly, our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects may be adversely affected by certain events or activities, including, but not limited to:\nAny such event or activity, among others, could cause governments and\ngovernmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our platforms and services in the future, reduce the size or payment amounts of purchases from existing or new government customers, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nWe have contracts with governments that involve classified\nprograms, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from programs with\ngovernments and government agencies that are subject to security restrictions (e.g., contracts involving classified information, classified contracts, and classified\n62\nprograms), which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for national security purposes under applicable law and regulation. In general, access to classified\ninformation, technology, facilities, or programs requires appropriate personnel security clearances, is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability, and may also require appropriate facility clearances and other specialized\ninfrastructure. In the event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, or programs or personnel holding clearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational, and reputational harm. We are limited in\nour ability to provide specific information about these classified programs, their risks, or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and\ntherefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business or our business overall. However, historically the business risks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our\nother government contracts.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our employees cannot obtain and maintain required personnel\nsecurity clearances or we cannot establish and maintain a required facility security clearance.\nCertain government contracts may\nrequire our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances and may require us to maintain a facility security clearance to comply with U.S. and international government agency requirements. Many governments have strict security\nclearance requirements for personnel who perform work in support of classified programs. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees typically involves a lengthy process, and it can be difficult to identify, recruit, and retain\nemployees who already hold security clearances. If our employees are unable to obtain security clearances in a timely manner, or at all, or if our employees who hold security clearances are unable to maintain their clearances or terminate employment\nwith us, then we may be unable to comply with relevant U.S. and international government agency requirements, or our customers requiring classified work could choose to terminate or decide not to renew one or more contracts requiring employees to\nobtain or maintain security clearances upon expiration. To the extent we are not able to obtain or maintain a facility security clearance, we may not be able to bid on or win new classified contracts, and existing contracts requiring a facility\nsecurity clearance could be terminated, either of which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe majority of our customer contracts may be terminated by the customer at any time for convenience and may contain other provisions\npermitting the customer to discontinue contract performance, and if terminated contracts are not replaced, our results of operations may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In addition, our contracts with government customers\noften contain provisions with additional rights and remedies favorable to such customers that are not typically found in commercial contracts.\nThe majority of our contracts, including our government contracts, contain termination for convenience provisions. Customers that terminate\nsuch contracts may also be entitled to a pro rata refund of the amount of the customer deposit for the period of time remaining in the contract term after the applicable termination notice period expires. Government contracts often contain\nprovisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government customers with additional rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies allow government customers, among other things, to:\n63\nIf a customer were to unexpectedly terminate, cancel, or decline to exercise an option to renew with respect to one or more of our significant\ncontracts, or if a government were to suspend or debar us from doing business with such government, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially harmed.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations, or contractual provisions applicable to our business could cause us to lose government\ncustomers or our ability to contract with the U.S. and other governments.\nAs a government contractor, we must comply with laws,\nregulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts and inclusion on government contract vehicles, which affect how we and our partners do business with government agencies. As a\nresult of actual or perceived noncompliance with government contracting laws, regulations, or contractual provisions, we may be subject to audits and internal investigations which may prove costly to our business financially, divert management time,\nor limit our ability to continue selling our platforms and services to our government customers. These laws and regulations may impose other added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and\nrequirements, including\nnon-compliance\nin the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, penalties, and termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting\nfor a period of time with government agencies. Any such damages, penalties, disruption, or limitation in our ability to do business with a government could adversely impact, and could have a material adverse effect on, our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, public perception, and growth prospects.\nEvolving government procurement policies and increased\nemphasis on cost over performance could adversely affect our business.\nFederal, state, local, and foreign governments and\ngovernment agencies could implement procurement policies that negatively impact our profitability. Changes in procurement policy favoring more\nnon-commercial\npurchases, different pricing, or evaluation\ncriteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer’s view of what our pricing should be may affect the predictability of our margins on such contracts or make it more difficult to compete on certain types of programs.\n64\nGovernments and government agencies are continually evaluating their contract pricing and\nfinancing practices, and we have no assurance regarding the full scope and recurrence of any study and what changes will be proposed, if any, and their impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nIncreased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial\nperformance and customer relationships.\nA substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding. Even if we\nare successful in obtaining an award, we may encounter bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on any specific award. Bid protests could result, among other things, in significant expenses to us, contract modifications, or even loss of the contract\naward. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of a contract award, the resolution can extend the time until contract activity can begin and, as a result, delay the recognition of revenue. We also may not be successful in our efforts to\nprotest or challenge any bids for contracts that were not awarded to us, and we would be required to incur significant time and expense in such efforts.\nIn addition, governments and agencies increasingly have relied on competitive contract award types, including IDIQ and other multi-award\ncontracts, which have the potential to create pricing pressure and to increase our costs by requiring us to submit multiple bids and proposals. Multi-award contracts require us to make sustained efforts to obtain orders under the contract. The\ncompetitive bidding process entails substantial costs and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors.\nWe are experiencing increased competition while, at the same time, many of our customers are facing budget pressures, cutting costs,\nidentifying more affordable solutions, performing certain work internally rather than hiring contractors, and reducing product development cycles. To remain competitive, we must maintain consistently strong customer relationships, seek to understand\ncustomer priorities, and provide superior performance, advanced technology solutions, and service at an affordable cost with the agility that our customers require to satisfy their objectives in an increasingly price competitive environment. Failure\nto do so could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government may\nprocure\nnon-commercial\ndevelopmental services rather than commercial products, which could materially impact our future U.S. government business and revenue.\nU.S. government agencies, including our customers, often award large developmental item and service contracts to build custom software rather\nthan firm fixed-price contracts for commercial products. We sell commercial items and services and do not contract for\nnon-commercial\ndevelopmental services. The U.S. government is required to procure\ncommercial items and services to the maximum extent practicable in accordance with FASA, 10 U.S.C. § 2377; 41 U.S.C. § 3307, and the U.S. government may instead decide to procure\nnon-commercial\ndevelopmental items and services if commercial items and services are not practicable. In order to challenge a government decision to procure developmental items and services instead of commercial items and services, we would be required to file a\nbid protest at the agency level and/or with the Government Accountability Office. This can result in contentious communications with government agency legal and contracting offices, and may escalate to litigation in federal court. The results of any\nfuture challenges or potential litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, however, and any dispute or litigation with the U.S. government may not be resolved in our favor; moreover, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, such disputes or\nlitigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. These proceedings could adversely affect our reputation and relationship with government customers and could also result in negative\npublicity, which could harm customer and public perception of our business. The enforcement of FASA has resulted in a significant increase in our business with the U.S. federal government. Any change in or repeal of FASA, or a contrary\ninterpretation of FASA by a court of competent jurisdiction, would adversely affect our competitive position for U.S. federal government contracts.\n65\nA decline in the U.S. and other government budgets, changes in spending or budgetary\npriorities, or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenue and limit our growth prospects.\nBecause we generate a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts with governments and government agencies, and in particular from\ncontracts with the U.S. government and government agencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected by government spending caps or changes in government budgetary priorities, as well as by delays in the government budget process,\nprogram starts, or the award of contracts or orders under existing contract vehicles, including as a result of a new U.S. administration. Current U.S. government spending levels for defense-related and other programs may not be sustained beyond\ngovernment fiscal year 2021. Future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending\nauthorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of shifts in spending priorities from defense-related and other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds and the number and intensity of military conflicts or other\nfactors.\nThe U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities which may shift Department of\nDefense budgetary priorities, reduce overall spending, or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenue. A significant decline in overall\nU.S. government spending, a significant shift in spending priorities, the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defense-related programs, or significant budget-related delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could\nadversely affect our future revenue and limit our growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe public trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating\nperformance.\nPrior to the listing of our Class A common stock, there was no public market for shares of our Class A\ncommon stock. The market prices of the securities of other newly public companies have historically been highly volatile. The public trading price of our Class A common stock could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors,\nincluding those listed in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K,\nsome of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock since\nyou might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the public trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n66\nIn addition, stock markets, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have\naffected and continue to affect the trading prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, including technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the trading price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted\nagainst us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for\nsubstantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,\neach of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, stockholders, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive\nforum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our\nstockholders, (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under, any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, (d) any action or proceeding as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (e) any action or proceeding\nasserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the\n67\nCourt of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court in Delaware or, if no state court in Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any\nappellate court therefrom, in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over the claims at issue and the indispensable parties; provided that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty\ncreated by the Exchange Act.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), creates\nconcurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the\nthreat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any\ncomplaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding\nor owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing increased\nconsistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for\ndisputes with us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees. Our\nstockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provisions. Further, in the event a court finds either exclusive forum\nprovision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets or the perception that sales might occur, including\nsales by our Founders and their affiliates, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of\nsubstantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets or the perception that sales might occur, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nIn addition to the supply and demand and volatility risk factors discussed above, sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A\ncommon stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur in large quantities, could cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to decline. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 133.6 million options will expire through December 2022 (including approximately 66.3 million options held by Mr. Karp which will expire in December 2021) if not exercised\nprior to their respective expiration dates, and we expect many holders will elect to exercise such options prior to expiration. Upon exercise, the holders will receive shares of our Class A or Class B common stock, which may subsequently\nbe sold.\nOur executive officers, directors, and record holders representing over 99% of our capital stock and securities convertible into\nor exchangeable for our capital stock were subject to market standoff or\nlock-up\nagreements with us under which they were prohibited from selling shares of our capital stock until February 18, 2021 (the\n“lock-up\nperiod”), except as described below and subject to certain other exceptions. As such, an aggregate of approximately 1,836.0 million shares, including shares issuable upon exercise of\noutstanding stock options, were recently released from the\nlock-up\nprovisions following expiration of the\nlock-up\nperiod related to our listing on the NYSE, subject to\napplicable securities laws and our insider trading policy. Sales of substantial amounts of stock in the public markets following the expiration of the\nlock-up\nperiod, or the perception that sales might occur,\ncould cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\n68\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 1,542,057,292 shares of our Class A common\nstock outstanding, 249,077,252 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding and 1,005,000 shares of our Class F common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares may be immediately sold. Moreover,\nnon-affiliates\nwho have beneficially owned our Class A common stock for at least six months may rely on Rule 144 to sell their shares of Class A common stock, and our directors, executive officers,\nand other affiliates (including our Founders and their affiliates) who have beneficially owned our Class A common stock for at least six months are entitled to sell their shares of our Class A common stock subject to volume limitations\nunder Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nFurther, as of December 31, 2020, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate\nof 253,744,515 shares of our Class A common stock and 282,021,988 shares of our Class B common stock, 124,870,238 shares of our Class A common stock and 60,000,000 shares of Class B common stock subject to RSUs and 1,470,781\nshares of our Class A common stock subject to growth units. All shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans have been registered for\npublic resale under the Securities Act. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and compliance by affiliates with Rule 144, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSUs and\ngrowth units will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nWhile the registration rights of our\nnon-affiliates pursuant to our Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement dated August 24, 2020 to require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States have expired under the terms of that agreement, our\naffiliates who are party to the Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement, including our Founders and certain of the entities affiliated with Peter Thiel, will retain the right to cause us to register shares held by them for resale until\nsuch rights terminate in accordance with our Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement. Any registration statement we file to register additional shares, whether as a result of registration rights or otherwise and whether in connection\nwith the exercise of stock options, the settlement of RSUs or growth units, or the exercise or settlement of other awards or otherwise, could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline or be volatile.\nWe also may issue our capital stock or securities convertible into our capital stock from time to time in connection with a financing,\nacquisition, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are intended to discourage certain\ntypes of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened acquisition of the company, which will likely depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our\ncompany more difficult, including the following:\n69\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay or\nprevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate\nactions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing\nto pay for our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or\nunfavorable research about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the trading price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts\npublish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our ordinary shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, the trading price of our Class A common stock would\nlikely decline. If these analysts publish target prices for our Class A common stock that are below the then-current public price of our Class A common stock, it could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline\nsignificantly. Further, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Palantir or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock trading price\nand trading volume to decline.\nAlthough we currently are not considered to be a “controlled company” under the NYSE\ncorporate governance rules, we may in the future become a controlled company due to the concentration of voting power among our Founders and their affiliates.\nAlthough we currently are not considered to be a “controlled company” under the NYSE corporate governance rules, we may in the\nfuture become a controlled company due to the concentration of voting power among our Founders and their affiliates resulting from the issuance of our Class F common stock. See “\n—Risks Related to the Multiple\nClass\nStructure of our Common Stock, the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, and the\nFounder Voting Agreement\n” below. A “controlled company” pursuant to the NYSE corporate governance rules is a company of\nwhich more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group, or another company. In the event that our Founders or other stockholders acquire more than 50% of the voting power of the Company, we may in the future be able to rely on the\n“controlled company” exemptions under the NYSE corporate governance rules due to this concentration of voting power and the ability of our Founders and their affiliates to act as a group. If we were a controlled company, we would be\neligible to and could elect not to comply with certain of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Such standards include the requirement that a majority of directors on our board of directors are independent directors, subject to certain\nphase-in\nperiods, and the requirement that our compensation, nominating and governance committee consist entirely of independent directors. In such a case, if the interests of our stockholders differ from the group\nof stockholders holding a\n70\nmajority of the voting power, our stockholders would not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance standards, and the\nability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and corporate matters may be reduced.\nWe do not expect to\npay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend\nto retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our credit facility contains\nrestrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price\nappreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nRisks Related to the Multiple\nClass Structure of our Common Stock, the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, and the Founder Voting Agreement\nThe multiple\nclass structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting power with certain stockholders, in particular, our Founders and their affiliates, which will effectively eliminate your ability to influence the outcome of important\ntransactions, including a change in control.\nOur Class A common stock has one (1) vote per share, and our Class B\ncommon stock has ten (10) votes per share. Our Class F common stock has a variable number of votes that, together with the Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement, ensure our Founders who are then party to the\nFounder Voting Agreement will retain up to 49.999999% of the Company’s voting power, and the Founders may, in certain circumstances in the future, have voting power that, in the aggregate, exceeds 49.999999% of the Company’s voting power.\nThe Founders’ ability to exercise the voting power of the Class F common stock is subject to the Founders and certain of their affiliates collectively meeting the Ownership Threshold (as defined below) on the applicable record date for a\nvote of the stockholders (except as provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation). Accordingly, such Founders will effectively control all matters submitted to the stockholders for the foreseeable future, including the election\nof directors, amendments of our organizational documents, compensation matters, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.\nThe Founders may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your\ninterests. This concentrated control is likely to have the effect of limiting the likelihood of an unsolicited merger proposal, unsolicited tender offer, or proxy contest for the removal of directors. As a result, our governance structure and the\nadoption of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices and make it more difficult to replace our directors\nand management.\nThe Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement also have the effect of concentrating voting\npower with our Founders and their affiliates, which will effectively eliminate your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur Founders have agreed through the Founder Voting Trust Agreement and Founder Voting Agreement that all of the shares of Class F common\nstock and all of the shares of our capital stock over which they and their affiliates have granted a proxy under the Founder Voting Agreement will be voted in the manner instructed by a majority of our Founders who are then party to the Founder\nVoting Agreement. Accordingly, together with the multiple class structure of our common stock, such Founders will effectively control all matters submitted to the stockholders for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors,\namendments of our organizational documents, compensation matters, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or\n71\nother major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. Upon the withdrawal or removal of any of our Founders from the Founder Voting Agreement, including upon their death or\ndisability, the remaining Founders or Founder, as the case may be, will determine the manner in which the shares of our Class F common stock as well as the shares subject to the Founder Voting Agreement are voted.\nIn such cases, the voting power of our outstanding capital stock will be further concentrated among the remaining Founders, which may be as\nfew as one. Further, if there are only two Founders who are party to the Founder Voting Agreement, one Founder will be able to effectively defeat any shareholder action, except for the election of directors under a plurality standard, if his\ninstruction to vote the shares of Class F common stock differs from the other Founder. The Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will retain the right to direct the voting of the Class F common stock without regard to\ntheir employment status with us.\nAll shares of our Class F common stock are held by a voting trust established by our Founders and\nvoted pursuant to the Founder Voting Trust Agreement. Accordingly, our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will control any vote that requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our Class F common\nstock, including action of our stockholders by written consent, the designation or issuance by us of shares of preferred stock, and certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to our preferred stock.\nAlthough we are a third-party beneficiary of the Founder Voting Agreement and the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, we do not have a general\nconsent right with respect to amendments thereto, and either agreement may be amended or modified in the future in a manner that is adverse to our stockholders, which may include increasing the ability of one or more of our Founders to exercise\ncontrol over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nIn certain circumstances in the future, the Founders and their\naffiliates could have voting power that exceeds 49.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\nOur amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation does not prevent our Founders and their affiliates from having more than 49.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate. In the future, our Founders and their affiliates could have\nvoting power that exceeds 49.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate, including substantially in excess, as a result of their ownership of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock alone. In\nthis case, the shares of our Class F common stock would generally be entitled to zero votes per share, but all of the shares that are then subject to the Founder Voting Agreement would continue to be exercised in accordance with the decision of\na majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement.\nFor example, if the Founders and their\naffiliates hold shares other than the Class F common stock, such as the Class B common stock, that, in the aggregate, have voting power that exceeds 49.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, the total voting power of\nthe Founders and their affiliates would exceed 49.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate. This circumstance could occur if other holders of Class B common stock convert or sell such shares to a greater\ndegree than the Founders do, which would result in an increase in the Founders’ share of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Certain transfers by holders of Class B common stock may result in a conversion of such shares to\nClass A common stock, even in circumstances that may not result in such a conversion in other companies that have dual or multiple class capital structures. As an example, if a holder of Class B common stock transfers less than all of such\nholder’s Class B common stock pursuant to certain permitted transfer provisions, such transferred shares will convert into Class A common stock, which may have the result of increasing the voting power of the remaining holders of\nClass B common stock, including the Founders. Conversely, certain other transfers by holders of Class B common stock may not result in a conversion of such shares to Class A common stock, even in circumstances that may result in such\na conversion in other companies that have dual or multiple class capital structures. For instance, the Board of Directors or certain officers may approve the transfer of shares of Class B\n72\ncommon stock, in which case such transfer will not result in a conversion of such shares to Class A common stock. Similarly, our Founders may acquire additional shares of our Class A\ncommon stock or Class B common stock. Shares of our Class B common stock may be transferred (without converting into shares of Class A common stock) to, among others, our Founders, and such transfers to our Founders would increase the\ntotal voting power of the Founders and their affiliates above 49.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate. Excluding the voting power of the Class F common stock, our Founders and their affiliates owned\nshares entitled to approximately 21.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of February 19, 2021.\nIn addition, if one\nor two Founders withdraw from the Founder Voting Agreement, the total voting power of the Founders and their affiliates could exceed 49.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate. For instance, if one Founder has\nwithdrawn from the Founder Voting Agreement and such Founder and his affiliates vote shares entitled to 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, our Founders would vote up to 59.999999% of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock in the aggregate. If such Founder votes such shares in the same manner as the shares of Class F common stock are voted pursuant to the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, our Founders, in the aggregate, would vote up to 59.999999% of the\nvoting power of our capital stock in such manner.\nSimilarly, the calculation of the voting power of the Class F common stock may not\ntake into account all shares that are deemed to be beneficially owned by any Founder or his affiliates, including certain shares for which a proxy has not been granted under the Founder Voting Agreement pursuant to its terms or by an amendment\nthereof, in particular if certain shares are withdrawn from such proxy.\nAs a result of future issuances of our common stock or the\ndisposal of shares of our common stock by our Founders and their affiliates, our Founders and their affiliates could have voting power that is substantially greater than, and outsized in comparison to, their economic interests and the percentage of\nour common stock that they hold.\nIn certain circumstances, our Founders and their affiliates could have voting power that is\nsubstantially greater than, and outsized in comparison to, their economic interests and the percentage of our common stock that they hold. This separation between voting power and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our\nFounders and our other stockholders, which may result in our Founders undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for the Founders or their affiliates but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nIn the event that our Founders have less than 49.999999% of the voting power of our capital stock prior to giving effect to the voting power\nof the Class F common stock, the issuance of additional shares by us in the future to stockholders other than our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will dilute the economic interests of our Founders but will not result\nin further dilution of the voting power of such Founders. Because the shares of Class F common stock have variable voting rights, such issuances will instead correspondingly increase the voting power of the Class F common stock. For\ninstance, if the Founders who are party to the Founder Voting Agreement have 30% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate prior to giving effect to the voting power of the Class F common stock, the Class F common\nstock would have up to 19.999999% of our voting power and such Founders would have up to 49.999999% of our voting power. After an issuance of shares of our capital stock entitled to 10% of our voting power in aggregate to stockholders other than our\nFounders, our Founders who are party to the Founder Voting Agreement would have approximately 27% of our voting power, the Class F common stock would have up to approximately 22.999999% of our voting power and such Founders would have up to\n49.999999% of our voting power. Any future issuances of additional shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the NYSE.\nIn addition, our Founders are free to transfer or otherwise dispose of their shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock\nwithout diminishing their voting power so long as our Founders and certain of their\n73\naffiliates continue to collectively hold 100,000,000 Corporation Equity Securities (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) on the applicable record date (subject to\nequitable adjustments as provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) (the “Ownership Threshold”). Shares of our Class F common stock will not convert into shares of our Class B common stock, and our\nmulti-class structure will not terminate, solely because our Founders and certain of their affiliates do not satisfy this Ownership Threshold on the applicable record date. Upon the withdrawal, or removal, of one or more of our Founders from the\nFounder Voting Agreement (including as a result of death or disability), the Ownership Threshold that must be met on the applicable record date will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the ownership of Corporation Equity Securities (which\nexcludes Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares) of the Founders and certain of their affiliates as of August 10, 2020, which could substantially decrease the Ownership Threshold without reducing the effective voting power of the\nClass F common stock. Accordingly, our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will be able to achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings, and substantially diminish their economic interest in us, without diminishing\ntheir voting power.\nFor example, 89,007,617 shares held by our Founders and their affiliates were permitted to be sold immediately under\nthe\nlock-up\nagreements and were registered for resale pursuant to the registration statement relating to our direct listing on the NYSE. Following the expiration of their\nlock-up\nagreements, our Founders are now free to sell all of their remaining shares pursuant to Rule 144 (subject to volume limitations) at such times and in such amounts as they determine. The total voting\npower that will be exercised in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will not be diminished as a result of these sales, so long as such Founders and certain of their\naffiliates collectively meet the Ownership Threshold on the applicable record date.\nFurthermore, meeting the Ownership Threshold on the\napplicable record date will not ensure that the Founders do not or will not have differing economic interests from the interests of holders of the Class A common stock. For example, the Founder Voting Agreement does not prohibit a Founder from\nhedging his economic exposure to our common stock; however, we have implemented a policy that will prohibit hedging by our directors, officers and employees, which currently includes the Founders. In addition, the trustee will vote shares of\nClass F common stock in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement, regardless of such Founders’ relative ownership of any class of our common stock.\nIn August 2020, we granted two of our Founders, Mr. Karp, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, and Mr. Cohen,\nour President and a member of our Board of Directors, options and RSUs for an aggregate of 207.0 million shares of our Class B common stock (collectively, the “Founder Grants”), which will become vested, exercisable and/or settle upon the\nfuture satisfaction of service conditions and certain other conditions. These awards are expected to contribute to the Founders’ ability to meet the Ownership Threshold on the applicable record date at least until the sale of such shares by Mr.\nKarp and Mr. Cohen.\nShares of our common stock designated by one or more of our Founders pursuant to our amended and restated\ncertificate of incorporation may be voted or not voted by such Founders in their discretion and will reduce the voting power exercised in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting\nAgreement.\nMr. Thiel has identified a portion of the shares of Class B common stock and Class A common stock\nbeneficially owned by him and his affiliates as Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation), which will not be subject to the Founder Voting Agreement. Such Designated\nFounders’ Excluded Shares would reduce the total voting power that will be exercised in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement. Mr. Thiel or his affiliates\nwould vote or not vote such Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares in their discretion, which may include in a manner different than the voting power exercised in accordance with the decision of a majority in number of the Founders who are then\nparty to the Founder Voting Agreement. Depending on certain circumstances, including the extent to which other holders of Class B common stock convert or sell such shares\n74\nof Class B common stock, such Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares may have significant voting power and increase Mr. Thiel or his affiliates’ relative voting power compared\nto the other Founders. The shares identified by Mr. Thiel as Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares represented approximately 4.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of February 19, 2021. In the future, Mr. Thiel or\nour other Founders could designate additional shares as Designated Founders’ Excluded Shares.\nThe Ownership Threshold that\nmust be met on any applicable record date is a small minority of our outstanding Corporation Equity Securities, and future issuances of Corporation Equity Securities may decrease this percentage.\nThe Ownership Threshold that must be met on any applicable record date is 100,000,000 Corporation Equity Securities as of the date hereof,\nwhich is a small minority of our outstanding Corporation Equity Securities. While the number of outstanding Corporation Equity Securities may exceed the number of shares of our outstanding capital stock, as a comparison, there were 1,792,139,544\nshares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Except for certain equitable adjustments as provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, future issuances of Corporation Equity Securities by us will not\nincrease the Ownership Threshold that must be met on any applicable record date and, accordingly, will decrease the percentage of outstanding Corporation Equity Securities represented by the Ownership Threshold.\nUpon the withdrawal, or removal, of one or more of our Founders from the Founder Voting Agreement (including as a result of death or\ndisability), the Ownership Threshold that must be met on the applicable record date will be reduced on a pro rata basis based on the ownership of Corporation Equity Securities of the Founders and certain of their affiliates as of August 10,\n2020. We expect that the Ownership Threshold will be reduced by approximately 57 million Corporation Equity Securities upon the withdrawal or removal from the Founder Voting Agreement of Alexander Karp, approximately 12 million Corporation\nEquity Securities upon the withdrawal or removal of Stephen Cohen, and approximately 31 million Corporation Equity Securities upon the withdrawal or removal of Peter Thiel if such withdrawals or removals were to happen.\nIn addition, in the future we could create a new class of equity securities with different economic or voting rights than existing classes. If\nwe were to create a new class of equity security, because of the broad definition of “Corporation Equity Securities,” such security could qualify as Corporation Equity Securities and therefore count towards the Ownership Threshold if held\nby our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement. If such security has lesser or no economic rights, it could have the effect of further increasing the divergence between the economic interests of our Founders who are then party to\nthe Founder Voting Agreement, on the one hand, and the voting power of such Founders, on the other. Further, Corporation Equity Securities includes, among other things, any warrants, calls, options or other right, whether vested or unvested, to\nacquire from the Company certain voting or equity securities from the Company. Accordingly, the Board of Directors could issue additional equity securities, or additional options, RSUs, warrants or other rights to acquire equity securities (whether\nvested or unvested), to our Founders, which would increase the number of Corporation Equity Securities they hold and enable them to meet the Ownership Threshold notwithstanding sales of Corporation Equity Securities that they currently hold. As a\nresult, any Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement could hold a nominal equity interest with little to no voting rights but meet the Ownership Threshold and therefore have voting power that provides effective control of our\ncompany.\nThe multiple class structure of our common stock features certain provisions that are novel or otherwise not common among\nother corporations with multiple class structures.\nA number of provisions relating to the multiple class structure of our common\nstock are novel or otherwise not common among other corporations with multiple class structures. For instance, our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement are free to transfer or otherwise dispose of their shares of Class A\ncommon stock and Class B common stock without diminishing their voting control so long as our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement and certain of their affiliates meet the Ownership Threshold (as defined\n75\nbelow) on the applicable record date. Shares of our Class B common stock, which have ten (10) votes per share, may remain outstanding in perpetuity. Additionally, shares of our\nClass B common stock may be transferred (without converting into shares of Class A common stock) to, among others, our Founders, which could result in our Founders or other stockholders obtaining additional voting control.\nAdditionally, certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to the calculation of the voting power of\nthe Class F common stock may have an adverse effect on our stockholders other than our Founders. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our Founders have the right to challenge our calculation of the voting power of the\nClass F common stock. Such a challenge may cause delays in the certification of any vote of our stockholders or in the effectiveness of any action of our stockholders. Additionally, if our Founders or the grantee under the Founder Voting\nAgreement do not provide information relating to certain shares of common stock as required by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we may not be able to accurately calculate the voting power of our Class F common stock, which\nmay result in an increase of the voting power of our Founders.\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock, the Founder Voting\nTrust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement by which our Founders exercise effective control over all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders will exist for the foreseeable future.\nShares of our Class F common stock will convert automatically into shares of our Class B common stock only if the Founder Voting\nTrust Agreement or the Founder Voting Agreement is terminated. Each of these agreements could remain in place until the death of our last living Founder. As of December 31, 2020, our Founders were 53, 53, and 38 years old. Further, upon a\ndiscretionary or compulsory withdrawal of a Founder as a beneficiary of the Founder Voting Trust Agreement, the Trustee will instruct our transfer agent and us to convert the withdrawing Founder’s pro rata portion of the shares of Class F\ncommon stock held in the Founder Voting Trust at the time of the withdrawal into shares of Class B common stock in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nBecause of the\nten-to-one\nvoting ratio between our\nClass B and Class A common stock, even if the Class F common stock converts to Class B common stock, our Founders will collectively control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock based on their current\nownership. Future transfers by holders of shares of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning\npurposes and transfers between related entities. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those individual holders of Class B common\nstock who retain their shares in the long term. If our Founders, individually or collectively, retain a significant portion of their holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, they could, in the future, individually or\ncollectively, continue to control a significant portion of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, even without the use of the Class F common stock, and such voting power could enable holders of\nClass B common stock to effectively control all matters subject to the stockholder approval. Shares of our Class B common stock may remain outstanding in perpetuity.\nFurther, if all, or a large portion, of the Founder Grants should be exercised or vest and settle, our Founders will increase their voting\npower of our Class B common stock. Although the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation only provide for a separate vote of the holders of our Class B common stock on limited matters, under Delaware law, certain\nactions may require the approval of the holders of the Class B common stock voting as a separate class. For example, if we amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to adversely affect the special rights, powers, or\npreferences of our Class B common stock in a manner that does not so affect the Class A common stock or Class F common stock, Delaware law could require approval of the holders of our Class B common stock voting separately as\nsingle class. For any vote of the Class B common stock voting as a separate class, our Founders will significantly influence such vote if all, or a large portion, of the Founder Grants should vest and settle and the Founders retain such shares.\n76\nOur governance structure may negatively affect the decision by certain institutional\ninvestors to purchase or hold shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe holding of\nlow-voting\nstock, such as our Class A common stock, may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to the portfolio managers of certain\ninstitutional investors. In addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their\nindices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Our multi-class capital structure may make us ineligible for inclusion in any of\nthese and certain other indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices would not invest in our stock. These policies may depress our valuation compared to\nthose of other similar companies that are included.\nFuture issuances of our Class A common stock will dilute the voting power\nof our Class A common stockholders but may not result in further dilution of the voting power of our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement.\nFuture issuances of our Class A common stock will dilute the voting power of our Class A common stockholders and future issuances to\nstockholders other than our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement will dilute the economic interests of our Founders. However, because the shares of Class F common stock have variable voting rights, in the event that our\nFounders have less than 49.999999% of the voting power of our capital stock prior to giving effect to the voting power of the Class F common stock, future issuances of Class A common stock to stockholders other than our Founders will not\nresult in dilution of the voting power of our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement, but rather, will correspondingly increase the voting power of the Class F common stock. For instance, if the Founders who are party to\nthe Founder Voting Agreement have 30% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate prior to giving effect to the voting power of the Class F common stock, the Class F common stock would have up to 19.999999% of our\nvoting power resulting in such Founders having up to 49.999999% of our voting power. If we were to issue additional shares of our capital stock entitled to 10% of our voting power in aggregate to stockholders other than our Founders, then our\nFounders who are party to the Founder Voting Agreement would have approximately 27% of our voting power, and the Class F common stock would have up to approximately 22.999999% of our voting power, resulting in such Founders having up to\n49.999999% of our voting power. Any future issuances of additional shares of Class A common stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the NYSE. In addition, it may be very difficult\nfor our Class A common stockholders to determine from time to time, including in advance of a meeting of stockholders, their individual or aggregate voting power due to the unique features of our multi-class capital structure, such as the\nvariable number of votes per share of our Class F common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on the economic health of our current and prospective customers and overall demand for technology. In addition, the\npurchase of our platforms and services is often discretionary and typically involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources. A further downturn in economic conditions, global political and economic uncertainty, a lack of\navailability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, the curtailment of government or corporate spending, public health concerns or emergencies, financial market volatility, and other factors have in the past and may in the\nfuture affect the industries to which we sell our platforms and services. Our customers may suffer from reduced operating budgets, which could cause them to defer or forego purchases of our platforms or services. Moreover, competitors may respond to\nmarket conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers, and the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our offerings. Uncertainty about global and\n77\nregional economic conditions, a downturn in the technology sector or any sectors in which our customers operate, or a reduction in information technology spending even if economic conditions are\nstable, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our platforms and services, material default rates among our customers, reduced sales of\nour platforms or services, and lower or no growth.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any crises, economic slowdown\nor any subsequent recovery generally, or for any industry in particular. Although certain aspects of the effects of a crisis or an economic slowdown may provide potential new opportunities for our business, we cannot guarantee that the net impact of\nany such events will not be materially negative. Accordingly, if the conditions in the general economy and the markets in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial\nstatements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange\nAct, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the listing standards of the NYSE. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make\nsome activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe\nSarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We have developed and refined our financial reporting and other disclosure controls and\nprocedures, and will continue to do so. For example, we recently reimplemented our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This may be disruptive to our business if the ERP system does not work as planned or if we experience issues\nrelating to the reimplementation, in which case we may be unable to timely or accurately prepare financial reports, make payments to our suppliers and employees, or invoice and collect from our customers. Our controls are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and\nthat information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Some\nmembers of our management team have limited or no experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies, and we have limited\naccounting and financial reporting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls and related procedures, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that we\nwill eventually be required to include in our annual reports filed with the SEC. We will need to hire and successfully integrate additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate company experience and technical accounting knowledge, as\nwell as implement and integrate new technological systems. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our financial statement and disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and\nanticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, we\nhave identified in the past, and may identify in the future, deficiencies in our controls. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of\noperations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also\ncause investors to lose\n78\nconfidence in our reported financial and other information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to\nmeet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE. As of December 31, 2020 we were not required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make\na formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. We will be required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2021, with our second Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nWe expect our independent\nregistered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form\n10-K.\nAt such time,\nour independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain\neffective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we have\nincurred and will continue to incur greater legal, accounting, finance, and other expenses than we incurred as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the rules and regulations of the NYSE. These requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have\nmade, and will continue to make, some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations.\nAs a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management’s attention may be diverted from the\nday-to-day\nmanagement of our business, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees\nto assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. Additionally, as a public company subject to additional rules and\nregulations and oversight, we may not have the same flexibility we had as a private company.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations, and\nstandards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards\nare subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in\ncontinuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and\nthis investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management’s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards\ndiffer from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nWe also expect these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be\nrequired to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of\nDirectors or as our executive officers.\n79\nWe ceased to be an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart our\nBusiness Startups Act of 2012 as of December 31, 2020. As a result, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, additional costs associated with being a public company, including costs associated with compliance with the auditor\nattestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the adoption of certain ASUs upon losing such status, and additional disclosure requirements.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K\nand other filings required\nof a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in an increased risk of threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources\nof our management and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNatural disasters and other events beyond\nour control could harm our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our\noperations,\nnon-U.S.\ncommerce and the global economy, and thus could have a negative effect on us. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, earthquakes, flooding, fire, power\nshortages, pandemics such as the recent spread of\nCOVID-19,\nterrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyberattacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change (such\nas drought, wildfires, increased storm severity, and sea level rise), and other events beyond our control. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our\nservices to our customers, could decrease demand for our services, could make existing customers unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual requirements to us, including their payment obligations, and could cause us to incur substantial\nexpense, including expenses or liabilities arising from potential litigation. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses or additional expense that we may sustain. Customer data could be lost, significant recovery time could be required to\nresume operations and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the event of a major natural disaster or catastrophic event.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes\nin the Euro and GBP. We expect our\nnon-U.S.\noperations to continue to grow in the near term and we are continually monitoring our foreign currency exposure to determine if we should consider a hedging program.\nToday, our\nnon-U.S.\ncontracts are denominated in either U.S. dollars or local currency, while our\nnon-U.S.\noperating expenses are often denominated in local currencies.\nAdditionally, as we expand our\nnon-U.S.\noperations, a larger portion of our operating expenses may be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, increases in the value of the U.S. dollar and decreases in the\nvalue of foreign currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of our revenues being lower."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our\nconsolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans,\nexpectations, and beliefs, involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. You should review the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the section titled “Risk Factors” for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nOur historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be\nexpected for any period in the future.\n83\nOverview\nWe founded the company in 2003 to build software for use in counterterrorism operations.\nIn 2008, we released our first platform, Palantir Gotham, for customers in the intelligence sector. Gotham enables users to identify patterns\nhidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants.\nDefense agencies in the\nUnited States then began using Gotham to investigate potential threats and to help protect soldiers from improvised explosive devices. Today, the platform is widely used by government agencies in the United States and its allies. Our software is on\nthe front lines, sometimes literally, and that means so are we.\nWe later began working with leading companies across industries,\nincluding companies in the energy, transportation, financial services, and healthcare sectors. In 2016, we released our second software platform, Palantir Foundry, to address a common set of challenges that we saw at large companies.\nFoundry is becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries.\nIn 2017, for example, our partnership with Airbus expanded into a platform for the aviation industry, and today connects data from more than\none hundred airlines and 9,000 aircraft around the world.\nWe believe that every large institution faces challenges that our platforms\nwere designed to address. Our focus in the near term is to build partnerships with institutions that have the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations — to reconstitute their operations around data. Over the\nlong term, we believe that every large institution in the markets we serve is a potential partner.\nDirect Listing\nOn September 30, 2020, we completed a direct listing of our Class A common stock, on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (the\n“Direct Listing”). Immediately prior to the Direct Listing and the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock were\nconverted into 797,743,185 shares of our Class B common stock, and all of our outstanding preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock warrants, which resulted in the reclassification of the warrants liability to additional paid-in\ncapital. Additionally, our restricted stock units (“RSUs”) had a performance vesting condition that was satisfied upon the completion of the Direct Listing. Accordingly, the Direct Listing resulted in the vesting and settlement of RSUs\ncovering 68,149,214 shares of Class A common stock and as a result we recorded cumulative stock-based compensation of $769.5 million on September 30, 2020.\nIn addition, we incurred fees related to financial advisory, accounting, legal and other professional services related to the Direct Listing\nand public company readiness initiatives and recorded $53.7 million primarily in general and administrative expense during the quarter ended September 30, 2020.\nOur Business\nFor\nthe year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in revenue, reflecting a 47% growth rate from the year ended December 31, 2019, when we generated $742.6 million in revenue.\nOur operating results have improved significantly in recent years when excluding stock-based compensation. In the year ended December 31,\n2020, we incurred losses from operations of $1.2 billion, or income from operations of $189.9 million when excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and non-recurring charges relating to our direct listing in 2020. In the\nyear ended December 31, 2019, our losses from operations were $576.4 million, or $334.5 million when excluding stock-based compensation.\n84\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, our gross profit was $740.1 million, reflecting a\ngross margin of 68%, or 81% when excluding stock-based compensation. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our gross profit was $500.2 million, reflecting a gross margin of 67%, or 71% when excluding stock-based compensation.\nFor more information about our income or loss from operations, when excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and\nnon-recurring direct listing charges; and gross profit, and gross margin, when excluding stock-based compensation, as well as reconciliations from loss from operations and gross profit, see the section titled “\nNon-GAAP\nReconciliations\n” below.\nOur Customers\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 139 customers, including leading companies in various commercial sectors as well as government agencies\naround the world.\nWe define a customer as an organization from which we have recognized revenue in a reporting period. For large\ngovernment agencies, where a single institution has multiple divisions, units, or subsidiary agencies, each such division, unit, or subsidiary agency that enters into a separate contract with us and is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a\nseparate customer. For example, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control, and National Institutes of Health are subsidiary agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, we treat each of those agencies\nas a separate customer given that the governing structures and procurement processes of each agency are independent.\nWe have built\nlasting and significant customer relationships with some of the world’s leading government institutions and companies. Our average revenue per customer in the year ended December 31, 2020 was $7.9 million, which grew 41% from $5.6 million\nper customer in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our top twenty customers generated $663.1 million in revenue, or 61% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. From those top twenty customers we generated average revenue\nper customer of $33.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, which grew 34% from an average of $24.8 million from the top twenty customers during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLarge organizations in the commercial and government sectors face similar challenges when it comes to managing data, and we intend to expand\nour reach in both markets moving forward. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 44% of our revenue came from commercial customers and 56% came from government agencies.\nWe have also expanded significantly outside the United States. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated 52% of our revenue from\ncustomers in the United States and the remaining 48% from customers abroad.\nCoronavirus (“COVID-19”) Impact\nAs a result of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures in order to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and\nthe communities in which we operate, including the suspension of all non-essential business travel of employees and the temporary closure of all of our major offices. Although the majority of our workforce currently works remotely, there has been\nminimal disruption in our ability to ensure the effective operation of our software platforms.\nThe economic consequences of the COVID-19\npandemic have been challenging for certain of our customers and prospective customers. While the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain, the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas, to date, not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting societal changes are currently not predictable.\n85\nThe pandemic has made clear to many of our customers that accommodating the extended\ntimelines ordinarily required to realize results from implementing new software solutions is not an option during a crisis. As a result, customers are increasingly adopting our software, which can be ready in days, over internal software development\nefforts, which may take months or years.\nWe have seen a decrease in our travel and office-related expenditures, including temporary\nclosures of our offices globally and reductions in related operating expenses, related to the ongoing pandemic. However, improvement of our contribution metric this year has also been driven by the expansion of existing customer accounts, improved\nsales efficiency, and the increasing deployment of centralized hosting and other software deployment infrastructure. While we expect our travel and office-related expenditures to increase moving forward, especially once we reopen our offices, we do\nnot expect such expenditures to return to their pre-pandemic levels, given that we have made significant investments in enabling employees to work with customers remotely.\nSee the section titled “\nRisk Factors\n” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the\npossible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nOur Business Model\nOur customers pay us to use the software platforms we have built.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we expect to generate revenue under our existing customer contracts for an additional 3.6 years on\ndollar-weighted average contract duration basis. Dollar-weighted average contract duration represents the length of time we expect to generate revenue on average, including existing contractual obligations and assuming that our customers will\nexercise all of the contractual options available to them, and is subject to change as we enter into new contracts or if customers terminate for convenience. We calculate this duration on a dollar-weighted basis to adjust for smaller deals. The\ntiming of our customer billings and receipt of payments varies from contract to contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term. Our contracts generally include terms that allow the customer to terminate the contract for\nconvenience.\nOur business model with respect to acquiring and growing our accounts has three phases: (1) Acquire, (2) Expand, and (3)\nScale. We categorize all customers into cohorts on December 31st each year.\nOur decisions about which customer relationships require\nfurther investment may change over time, based on our assessment of the potential long-term value that our software can generate for them.\nAs a result, customers may move back and forth through phases, as relationship needs and our assessment of the merits of further investment\nchange. We enter into initial pilots with customers, generally at our own expense and without a guarantee of future returns, in order to access a unique set of opportunities that others may pass over for lack of resources and shorter investment\nhorizons.\nSome customers may have a rapid Acquire phase followed by a long Expand phase. Others may skip the Expand phase altogether and\nmove immediately into the Scale phase. We manage customers at the account level, not by industry or sector, so that we can optimize on the specific growth opportunities for each.\nIn 2019, we generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which $0.6 million came from customers in the Acquire phase, $176.3 million\ncame from customers in the Expand phase, and $565.7 million came from customers in the Scale phase.\nIn 2020, those same customers from\n2019 generated a total of $1.1 billion in revenue. New customers acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020 generated an additional $41.8 million in revenue and were assigned a cohort as of December 31, 2020. A more detailed discussion of\nthe three phases, for purposes of illustration of how we manage accounts across the business, follows below.\n86\nAcquire\nWe actively pursue discussions with existing and prospective customers in order to identify ways in which our software platforms can provide\nlong-term value.\nIn the first phase, we typically acquire new opportunities with minimal risk to our customers through short-term pilot\ndeployments of our software platforms at no or low cost to them. We believe in proving the value of our platforms to our customers. During these short-term pilots, we operate the accounts at a loss. We believe that our investments during this phase\nwill drive future revenue growth.\nWe define a customer or potential customer as being in the Acquire phase if, as of the end of a\ncalendar year, we have recognized less than $100,000 in revenue from the customer that respective year. Customers may make nominal payments in connection with the evaluation of our software that we do not consider material in evaluating the\nperformance of our accounts.\nWe evaluate the success of customer accounts in the Acquire phase based on the revenue such accounts\ngenerate in the following year. In 2019, we generated $0.6 million in revenue from customers in the Acquire phase, which yielded a contribution loss of $65.4 million. In 2020, those same customers generated $77.1 million in revenue which yielded\ncontribution profit of $13.2 million.\nExpand\nOur investment in this second phase is often significant as we seek to understand the principal challenges faced by our customers and ensure\nthat our software delivers value and results.\nWe define a customer in the Expand phase as any customer from which we have recognized more\nthan $100,000 in revenue in a calendar year and whose account had a negative contribution margin during the year at issue, as determined as of the end of the year. In this phase, we operate at a loss, as measured by contribution margin, in order to\ndrive future revenue growth and margin expansion.\nIn 2019, we generated $176.3 million in revenue from customers that were in the Expand\nphase as of the end of that year, with a contribution margin of (43)%. In 2020, those same customers generated $360.4 million in revenue, with a contribution margin of 47%.\nScale\nAs\ncustomer accounts mature, our investment costs relative to revenue generally decrease, while the value our software provides to our customer increases, often significantly, as usage of the platform increases across the customer’s operations. In\nthis third phase, after having installed and configured the software across an entire enterprise, customers become more self-sufficient in their use of our platforms, including developing software and applications that run on top of our platforms,\nwhile still continuing to benefit from the support of our operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services.\nWe define a customer\nin the Scale phase as any customer from which we recognized more than $100,000 in revenue in a calendar year and whose account had a positive contribution margin during the year at issue, as determined as of the end of the year.\nIt is in the Scale phase of our partnerships with customers that we generally see contribution margin on particular accounts improve. In 2019,\nwe generated $565.7 million in revenue from customers in the Scale phase, with a contribution margin of 55%. In 2020, those same customers generated $613.4 million in revenue with a contribution margin of 70%.\n87\nWe believe that our customers will move into the Scale phase over the long term. We also\nbelieve that contribution margin for Scale phase accounts will increase further as we become more efficient at deploying our software platforms across the entirety of our customers’ operations and at managing and operating our software.\nTotal Remaining Deal Value\nWe are focused on building strategic relationships with, and delivering significant outcomes for, our customers over the long term. Our\ncontracts with our customers reflect that long-term orientation, often lasting for multiple years at a time.\nAs of December 31,\n2020, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we have been awarded by, or entered into with, government and commercial customers, including existing contractual obligations and contractual options available to those customers, was\n$2.8 billion, up from December 31, 2019, when our total remaining deal value of such contracts was $2.2 billion.\nOf our\ntotal remaining deal value, as of December 31, 2020, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we entered into with commercial customers, including existing contractual obligations and available contractual options, was\n$1.5 billion, up 45% from December 31, 2019, when the total remaining deal value of such contracts was $1.0 billion.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, the total remaining deal value of the contracts that we had been awarded by government agencies in the United States and allied countries around the world, including existing contractual obligations and contractual options\navailable to those government agencies, was $1.3 billion, up 14% from December 31, 2019, when the total value of such contracts was $1.1 billion. When calculating the total remaining deal value of government contracts, we do not\ninclude government contracts totaling $2.7 billion, as of December 31, 2020, that we have been awarded where the funding of such contracts — also known as indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts —\nhas not yet been determined. Funding of such contracts is not guaranteed.\nThe majority of our government and commercial contracts are\nsubject to termination for convenience provisions. Additionally, the U.S. federal government is prohibited from exercising contract options more than one year in advance. As a result, there can be no guarantee that our customer contracts will not be\nterminated or that contract options will be exercised.\nKey Business Measure\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key non-GAAP business measure to help us\nevaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions.\nContribution Margin\nWe believe that the revenue we generate relative to the costs we incur in order to generate such revenue is an important measure of the\nefficiency of our business. We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided by revenue. At the end of each year, we categorize each customer account into\none of the three phases based on its revenue and contribution margin for that year.\nRevenue is allocated to each customer account\ndirectly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the deployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing\nones. Our software engineers working with existing customers often manage the deployment and operation of our platforms as well\n88\nas identify new ways that those platforms can be used. To calculate the contribution by customer, we allocate cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation,\nto an account pro rata based on headcount and time spent on the account during the period. To the extent certain costs or personnel are not directly assigned to a specific account, they are allocated pro rata based on total headcount staffed during\nsuch period. Direct costs, such as third-party cloud hosting services, are directly allocated to the account to which they relate.\nContribution, both across our business and on specific customer accounts, is intended to capture how much we have earned from customers after\naccounting for the costs associated with deploying and operating our software, as well as any sales and marketing expenses involved in acquiring and expanding our partnerships with those customers, including allocated overhead. We exclude\nstock-based compensation as it is a non-cash expense.\nWe believe that our contribution margin across the business, and on specific\ncustomer accounts provides an important measure of the efficiency of our operations over time. We have included contribution margin because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our performance, and we believe that it also provides\nuseful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Our calculation of contribution margin may differ from similarly titled measures, if any, reported by other\ncompanies. Contribution margin should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFor more information about contribution margin, including the limitations of this measure, and a reconciliation to loss from operations, see\nthe section titled “\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\n” below.\nNon-GAAP\nReconciliations\nWe use the non-GAAP measures contribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and income\n(loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and non-recurring direct listing charges to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding\noperational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude expenses primarily related to the direct\nlisting during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, as they are a one-time nonrecurring charge, and employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, as it is difficult to predict and outside of our control.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other\ncompanies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations, as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP\ncontribution margin; gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation; and income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and non-recurring direct listing charges should be\nconsidered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for\nthese limitations by providing reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely\non any single financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n89\nContribution Margin\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of contribution margin for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except\npercentages):\nGross Profit and Gross Margin, Excluding Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of gross profit and gross margin, excluding stock-based compensation for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except percentages):\nIncome (Loss) from Operations, Excluding Stock-Based Compensation, Related Employer Payroll Taxes, and\nNon-Recurring Direct Listing Charges\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of income (loss) from operations, excluding\nstock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and non-recurring direct listing charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n90\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe\ngenerate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access our software in our hosted environment with O&M services (“Palantir Cloud”), software subscriptions in our customers’ environments with ongoing O&M services\n(“On-Premises\nSoftware”), and professional services.\nPalantir Cloud\nOur Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir\nand are sold together with stand-ready O&M services, as further described below. We promise to provide continuous access to the hosted software throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is recognized over\nthe contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir services to the customer.\nOn-Premises\nSoftware\nSales of our software subscriptions grant customers the right to use\nfunctional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. O&M services include critical updates and\nsupport and maintenance services required to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, we have concluded that the software subscriptions\nand O&M services, which together we refer to as our\nOn-Premises\nSoftware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the\ncontract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis.\nProfessional Services\nOur professional services support the customers’ use of the software and include, as needed,\non-demand\nuser support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of\non-demand\nprofessional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud or\nOn-Premises\nSoftware\nsubscriptions. Professional services are\non-demand,\nwhereby we perform services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&M and\nprofessional services, as well as third-party cloud hosting services, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nWe expect that cost of\nrevenue will increase in absolute dollars as our revenue grows and will vary from\nperiod-to-period\nas a percentage of revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing efforts span all stages of our sales cycle, including personnel engaging with or executing pilots at new or existing\ncustomers. Sales and marketing costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in executing on pilots and customer growth activities, as well as third-party cloud hosting services for our\npilots, marketing and sales event-related costs, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing costs are generally expensed as incurred.\n91\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue\nto invest in our potential and current customers, in growing our business and enhancing our brand awareness.\nResearch and\nDevelopment\nOur research and development efforts are aimed at continuing to develop and refine our platforms, including adding\nnew features and modules, increasing their functionality, and enhancing the usability of our platforms. Research and development costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing\nthe activities to develop and refine our platforms, internal use third-party cloud hosting services and other\nIT-related\ncosts, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe plan to continue to invest in personnel to support our research and development efforts. As a result, we expect that research and\ndevelopment expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest to support these activities.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative costs include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in our executive,\nfinance, legal, human resources, and administrative functions, as well as third-party professional services and fees, and allocated overhead.\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and enhance our systems,\nprocesses, and controls to support the growth in our business as well as our increased compliance and reporting requirements as a public company.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense and commitment fees incurred under our credit facilities.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses and our share of income and losses from our\nequity method investments.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrants\nThe change in the fair value of warrants consists of the net changes in the fair value of our liability classified warrants to purchase\nredeemable convertible and convertible preferred stock that were remeasured at the end of each reporting period. In connection with the Direct Listing, all of the Company’s outstanding preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock\nwarrants, which resulted in the reclassification of the warrants liability to additional\npaid-in\ncapital. As such, we do not expect additional charges related to the fair value of these warrants.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes consists of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business and\nwithholding taxes.\n92\nSegments\nWe have two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating decision\nmaker (“CODM”), who is our chief executive officer, manages our operations for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including our organizational and management reporting structure and customer type,\nwere considered in determining these operating segments.\nOur operating segments are described below:\nSegment profitability is evaluated based on\ncontribution and contribution margin. Contribution is segment revenue less the related costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Contribution margin is segment contribution divided by revenue. To\nthe extent costs of revenue or sales and marketing expenses are not directly attributable to a particular segment, they are allocated based upon headcount at each operating segment during the period. We use it, in part, to evaluate the performance\nof, and allocate resources to, each of our operating segments, which excludes certain operating expenses that are not allocated to operating segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs\ninclude stock-based compensation expense, research and development costs, and general and administrative costs, such as legal and accounting.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations data (in thousands):\n93\nThe following table sets forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenue:\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\n94\nRevenue increased by $350.1 million, or 47%, for the year ended December 31, 2020\ncompared to 2019. Revenue from government customers increased by $264.7 million, or 77%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily from customers in the United States. Of the increase, $243.4 million was from\ncustomers existing as of December 31, 2019. Revenue from commercial customers increased by $85.4 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The increase is primarily due to an increase of\n$59.7 million from customers existing as of December 31, 2019. Generally, increases in revenue from our existing customers are a result of increases in their adoption of our products and services within their organizations.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $110.2 million, or 45%, compared\nto 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $128.6 million, which included increases of $111.7 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to RSUs and charges related to the modification of certain options; $21.6 million in payroll and other costs primarily driven by an increase in headcount attributable to cost of revenue\nfunctions to support new and existing customers; and $5.7 million in employer payroll taxes primarily driven by income from the vesting of RSUs and increases in headcount. These increases in personnel costs were partially offset by decreases in\ntravel-related expenses and other personnel costs of $7.3 million as a result of COVID-related travel restrictions and company-wide initiatives to decrease overall travel and $3.1 million due to the timing of variable compensation\npayments. Additionally, there was an increase of $0.5 million related to other direct deployment costs and allocated overhead. These increases to costs of revenue were offset by decreases of $9.8 million related to third-party cloud\nhosting costs, generally as a result of volume-based discounts, $4.7 million related to hardware costs, and $4.4 million related to reduced usage of field service representatives.\nOur gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 1% compared to 2019. Gross margin increased as a result of\nefficiencies in supporting the revenue growth at our customer deployments, for example investments in our platforms, as well as reductions in third-party cloud hosting and hardware costs for customers. This was partly offset by increases in\nstock-based compensation related to the satisfaction of the performance-based vesting condition for RSUs upon our Direct Listing and charges related to the modification of certain options.\nOperating Expenses\n95\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $233.6 million, or 52%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The\nincrease was primarily driven by increases in personnel costs of $262.9 million, which included increases of $319.0 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense\nupon the Direct Listing from RSUs and charges related to the modification of certain options; $15.8 million from employer payroll taxes primarily driven by income from the vesting of RSUs; and $5.6 million in payroll costs related to an\nincrease in headcount attributable to our sales and marketing functions. These personnel costs were partially offset by decreases of $64.8 million in travel-related expenses and other personnel costs as a result of COVID-related travel\nrestrictions and company-wide initiatives to decrease overall travel, $7.2 million due to the timing of variable compensation payments, and $5.5 million from other payroll-related costs. Additionally, there was a decrease of\n$13.9 million in office related expenses as a result of temporary office closures and a decrease of $15.4 million related to allocated overhead.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and\ndevelopment expenses increased by $255.1 million, or 83%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increases in personnel costs of $283.4 million, which included increases of\n$289.1 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing from RSUs and charges related to the modification of certain options; $9.9 million\nin employer payroll taxes, primarily driven by income from the vesting of RSUs; and $8.6 million in payroll costs related to an increase in headcount attributable to our research and development functions. These personnel costs were partially\noffset by decreases of $13.8 million in travel-related expenses and other personnel costs as a result of COVID-related travel restrictions and company-wide initiatives to decrease overall travel, $6.9 million due to the timing of variable\ncompensation payments, and $3.5 million in other payroll-related costs. Additionally, there were decreases of $17.4 million in third-party cloud hosting services generally as a result of volume-based discounts, $9.5 million in office\nrelated expenses as a result of temporary office closures, and $1.4 million related to allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $348.5 million, or 109%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The\nincrease in expenses was primarily driven by increases in personnel costs of $306.0 million, which included increases of $308.9 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the recognition of cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense upon the Direct Listing from RSUs and charges related to the modification of certain options; $7.8 million in employer payroll taxes, partially driven by income from the vesting of RSUs; and $6.3 million in payroll\ncosts related to an increase in headcount attributable to our general and administrative functions. These personnel costs were partially offset by decreases of $12.4 million in travel-related expenses and other personnel costs primarily as a\nresult of COVID-related travel restrictions and company-wide initiatives to decrease overall travel, and $4.6 million due to the timing of variable compensation payments. Additionally, there were other increases in general and administrative\nexpenses of $50.5 million in legal professional services primarily related to the Direct Listing, $11.8 million for other professional services related to the Direct Listing and corporate IT and consulting functions to support initiatives\nfor becoming a public company and the overall growth of our operations, $12.9 million in third-party cloud hosting services and other IT, and $6.1 million in corporate insurance and other fees, which were offset by decreases of\n$22.4 million primarily from\nnon-recurring\nimpairment charges related to assets held for sale, $10.7 million in office related expenses as a result of temporary office closures, and $5.7 million\nrelated to allocated overhead.\n96\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased by $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019\nprimarily due to a reduction in U.S. interest rates on interest earned from our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.\nThe increase was primarily due to the absence of outstanding debt until December 2019.\nChange in Fair Value of Warrants\nThe gain on the change in fair value of warrants increased by $0.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The change was primarily due to adjustments to the fair value of the warrants immediately before reclassifying them from liability to equity, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the\nsecurities underlying certain warrants during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net changed by $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to\n2019 primarily due to increases in net realized and unrealized gains from foreign exchange transactions.\nProvision (Benefit) for\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a benefit for income taxes of $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020\ncompared to a provision of $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily due to decreases in profits from our international operations and foreign benefits from stock-based compensation.\n97\nQuarterly Results of Operations Data\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the last eight quarters ended\nDecember 31, 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages). The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form\n10-K\nand includes, in our opinion, all adjustments, necessary to state fairly our results of operations for these periods. This data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nThese quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the future results of operations for any future period.\n98\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the last eight quarterly periods presented as a\npercentage of our total revenue for those periods:\n99\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have generated negative cash flows from operations and have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our\nequity securities, borrowings under our credit facilities, and payments received from our customers. For many customers, we historically billed and collected payment for the entire contract term in advance of our performance of the related\nobligations. Our billing terms, however, are shifting to align with the timing of the work performed for our customers. As a result, our cash flows from operations may temporarily decrease as our billing cycles, deferred revenue and customer\ndeposits adjust to this shift. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months, as well as our short-term and long-term contractual\nobligations and commitments primarily consisting of operating lease commitments and\nnon-cancelable\npurchase commitments related to third-party cloud hosting services.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our accumulated deficit balance was $5.0 billion, and our principal sources of liquidity were\n$2.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, exclusive of additional restricted cash of $116.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds. Restricted cash\nprimarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees we are required to maintain for various purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $200.0 million outstanding of the available term commitment under the 2014 Credit Facility due in\nJune 2023 and an additional $200.0 million revolving credit facility available and undrawn. For more information, see the section titled “\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of\nOperations\n—\nCredit Facilities.\n”\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 206,500,523\nshares of our Class A common stock at $4.65 per share for net proceeds of approximately $942.5 million, which is net of issuance costs of $17.7 million, and received proceeds of $298.8 million from the exercise of 120,617,527\noptions.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the rate of our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain customers and their willingness and ability to pay for our products and services, and the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to market and develop our products. Further, we may enter into future arrangements\nto acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, strategic partnerships, and technologies. As such, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we\nmay not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If\n100\nadditional funds are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $296.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The factors affecting our operating\ncash flows during this period were our net loss of $1.2 billion and changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $454.1 million, offset by\nnon-cash\ncharges of $1.3 billion. The\nnon-cash\ncharges primarily consisted of $1.3 billion in stock-based compensation expense, $35.0 million of\nnon-cash\noperating lease expense, and $13.9 million\nof depreciation and amortization. The net change in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to net decrease of $261.8 million in deferred revenue and customer deposits due to the timing of revenue being recognized from amounts\nbilled and collected in prior periods, and an increase in assets of $156.0 million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable driven by the timing of billings to and collections from our customers.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $165.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The factors affecting our operating\ncash flows during this period were our net loss of $579.6 million, offset by\nnon-cash\ncharges of $280.4 million, and $134.0 million of cash provided from changes in our operating assets and\nliabilities. The\nnon-cash\ncharges primarily consisted of $242.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, $23.4 million of impairment of assets held for sale, and $12.3 million of\ndepreciation and amortization. The cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a net increase of $144.8 million in deferred revenue and customer deposits due to increased billings and payments\nreceived from customers in advance of revenue recognition and a $27.2 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of our increased spending and headcount associated with the growth of our business. These amounts\nwere partially offset by an increase in assets of $34.5 million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable driven by timing of contracts as well as an increase in deferred tax assets.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of purchases of\nproperty and equipment of $12.2 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $22.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, which consisted of an investment of $25.9 million in our equity method investment Palantir Technologies Japan, K.K. entity and purchases of property and equipment of $13.1 million, partially offset by a\n$17.0 million return of investment associated with the dissolution of our equity method investment Signac, LLC.\n101\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of\n$942.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $199.4 million of net proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities, and $298.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset\nby repayments of $400.0 million of debt.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $324.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, which consisted of $394.4 million of net proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities, $100.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $16.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of common\nstock options, and $7.5 million of proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock, partially offset by the redemption of redeemable convertible preferred stock of $168.0 million and the repurchase of convertible preferred\nand common stock of $25.1 million.\nCredit Facilities\n2014 Credit Facility\nIn October 2014, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility which has been subsequently amended (the “2014 Credit\nFacility”). The 2014 Credit Facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, subject to certain adjustments, and incurs a commitment fee of 0.375% assessed on the daily average\nundrawn portion of revolving commitments. Interest and commitment fees are payable at the end of an interest period or at each three-month interval if the interest period is longer than three months. The 2014 Credit Facility is secured with\nsubstantially all of our assets.\nIn December 2019, we drew down the $150.0 million term loan and $150.0 million under the\nexisting revolving credit facility. The term loan portion of the 2014 Credit Facility was fully repaid and terminated as of December 31, 2019.\nIn June 2020, we amended the 2014 Credit Facility to include a $150.0 million term loan, extend the maturity date to June 4, 2023,\nand add an additional lender. Additionally, this amendment increased the minimum liquidity required to be maintained, and we were provided with an option to increase the total commitments by up to an additional $200.0 million, subject to the\nlenders’ approval. All other terms and conditions remained substantially the same upon the effectiveness of the amendment. Upon entering into this amendment, we drew down the total available term loan commitment of $150.0 million.\nIn July 2020, we entered into another amendment to the 2014 Credit Facility, which added an additional lender and provided for an increase of\n$50.0 million to the revolving credit facility and a $50.0 million term loan. The incremental commitments were provided under the same terms as the existing commitments under the 2014 Credit Facility. During July 2020, we drew down the\nadditional available term loan of $50.0 million and repaid the $150.0 million outstanding revolving credit facility.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020, we had $200.0 million of term loans outstanding under the 2014 Credit Facility and an additional $200.0 million undrawn revolving credit facility available.\n2019 Credit Facility\nOn December 31, 2019, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2019 Credit Facility”) with a second\nlender. The 2019 Credit Facility allowed for the drawdown of up to $250.0 million. As of December 31, 2019 we had $250.0 million outstanding under the 2019 Credit Facility, and $125.0 million of the proceeds were required to be\nmaintained in a specified collateral account, which was reported in restricted cash, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet.\n102\nDuring June 2020, a portion of the proceeds drawn down under the 2014 Credit Facility were\nused to pay off the $250.0 million outstanding, balance of the revolving loan commitment under the 2019 Credit Facility, thus releasing the 50% restricted cash collateral previously required. As of December 31, 2020, the 2019 Credit\nFacility was terminated and there were no amounts outstanding.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nThe contractual obligations and commitments in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.\nDeferred Revenue and Customer Deposits\nDeferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. The\nportion of deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized as revenue during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, noncurrent.\nCustomer deposits consist of payments received for anticipated revenue generating activities in advance of the start of the contractual term\nor for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation and refund. The portion of customer deposits that is anticipated to be recognized as revenue during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as customer deposits and the\nremaining portion is recorded as customer deposits, noncurrent.\nOur deferred revenue and deferred revenue, noncurrent as of\nDecember 31, 2020 was $189.5 million and $50.5 million, respectively. Our customer deposits and customer deposits, noncurrent as of December 31, 2020 was $210.3 million and $81.5 million, respectively. Our total deferred\nrevenue and deferred revenue, noncurrent as of December 31, 2019 was $186.1 million and $77.0 million, respectively. Our total customer deposits and customer deposits, noncurrent as of December 31, 2019 was $364.1 million\nand $167.5 million, respectively.\n103\nOff-Balance\nSheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, any\noff-balance\nsheet financing arrangements or any\nrelationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating\noff-balance\nsheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical\nAccounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form\n10-K\nare prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly\nfrom our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these\nare the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nin our consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access our software Palantir Cloud and\nOn-Premises\nSoftware, with ongoing O&M services and professional services.\nIn accordance with\nASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, we recognized revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for promised goods\nor services. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model in accounting for our revenue arrangements:\nEach of our significant performance obligations and our application of ASC 606 to our revenue arrangements is discussed in further detail\nbelow.\nPalantir Cloud\nOur Palantir\nCloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment controlled by Palantir and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. We promise to provide continuous access to the hosted\nsoftware throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud subscriptions is recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir Cloud services to the customer.\n104\nOn-Premises\nSoftware\nSales of our software subscriptions grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property, either on their internal hardware\ninfrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are sold together with stand-ready O&M services. The O&M services include critical updates, support, and maintenance services required to operate our software and,\nas such, are necessary for our software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, we have concluded that the software subscriptions and O&M services, which together we refer to as our\nOn-Premises\nSoftware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is generally recognized over the contract term on a\nratable basis.\nProfessional Services\nOur professional services support the customers’ use of the software and include, as needed,\non-demand\nuser support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of\non-demand\nprofessional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud subscription or the\nOn-Premises\nSoftware. Professional services are\non-demand,\nwhereby we perform services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of\ncustomer billing and payment relative to the start of the service period varies from contract to contract; however, we bill many of our customers in advance of the provision of services under our contracts, resulting in contract liabilities\nconsisting of either deferred revenue or customer deposits (“contract liabilities”). Deferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Customer deposits\nconsist of payments received in advance of the start of the contractual term or for anticipated revenue generating activities for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation and refund. Our arrangements generally include terms\nthat allow the customer to terminate the contract for convenience and receive a\npro-rata\nrefund of the amount of the customer deposit for the period of time remaining in the contract term after the applicable\ntermination notice period expires. In these arrangements, we concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations after such notice period and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer that is subject to termination for\nconvenience is recorded as customer deposits.\nThe payment terms and conditions vary by contract; however, our terms generally require\npayment within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of payment, we elected to apply the practical expedient in accordance with ASC 606 to not adjust contract consideration\nfor the effects of a significant financing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when promised goods and services are transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods and services will be one\nyear or less. As such, we determined our contracts do not generally contain a significant financing component.\nAreas of Judgment and Estimation\nOur contracts with customers can include multiple promises to transfer goods or services to the customer. Determining whether\npromises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately – or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together – requires significant judgment. We concluded that the promise to\nprovide a software subscription is highly interdependent and interrelated with the promise to provide O&M services and such promises are not distinct within the context of our contracts and are accounted for as a single performance obligation\nfor our\nOn-Premises\nSoftware.\n105\nAdditionally, the pricing of our contracts is generally fixed; however, it is possible for\ncontracts to include variable consideration in the form of performance bonuses, which can be based on subjective or objective criteria. We include the estimated amount of variable consideration that we expect to receive to the extent it is probable\nthat a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Any amounts received in the form of performance bonuses were not material in the periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which\nrequire compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We determine the fair value of stock-based awards granted or modified on the grant date or modification date using\nappropriate valuation techniques.\nService-Based Vesting\nWe grant stock option awards and RSUs, that vest only based upon the satisfaction of a service condition. For stock option awards, we use the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options granted. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the\nexpected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of the common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option awards represent\nmanagement’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. For RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value of the RSUs as the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We record\nstock-based compensation expense for stock options and RSUs that vest only based upon the satisfaction of a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. We recognize forfeitures as they\noccur.\nPerformance-Based Vesting\nWe grant awards, including RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition. The performance-based\nvesting condition for the RSUs granted prior to our Direct Listing was satisfied upon the occurrence of the Direct Listing. The stock-based compensation expense related to such RSUs is recognized using the accelerated attribution method from the\ngrant date. The service-based vesting period for these awards varies across service providers and is up to five years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items not\ncurrently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, which are estimated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of\noperations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, the realization of our deferred tax assets are dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions,\nlosses, and credits can be utilized.\nWe evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it\nis more likely than not that a future benefit on such deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance, when recorded, would be included in our consolidated statements of operations. Our judgment is required in\ndetermining the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets.\n106\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than\nnot that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on\nthe largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, refer to\nNote 2.

Our investment policy and\nstrategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We have not entered into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nDue to the short-term nature of the financial instruments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates.

Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are,\ntherefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro and GBP. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in\nour statement of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been material to our consolidated financial statements, and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n107"

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and\n2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable convertible and convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.\nGAAP).\nAdoption of New Accounting Standard\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\nNo. 2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese\nfinancial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.\nThe communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.\n109\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 26, 2021\n110\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(1)\nDeferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 and 2019\nincludes $68.2 million and $75.0 million, respectively, from Palantir Technologies Japan, K.K.

Organization\nPalantir\nTechnologies Inc. (including its subsidiaries, “Palantir” or “the Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 6, 2003. The Company builds and deploys software platforms, Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry, that serve as\nthe central operating systems for its customers.\nDirect Listing\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company completed a direct listing of its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange\n(“NYSE”) (the “Direct Listing”).\nIn connection with the Direct Listing, on September 22, 2020, the Company filed\nan amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which became effective on that date. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorized the issuance of a total of 20,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and\n2,700,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, authorized 1,005,000 shares of a new class of common stock (“Class F common stock”) and 2,000,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock. In connection with the Direct Listing,\nAlexander Karp, Stephen Cohen, and Peter Thiel (the “Founders”) each transferred 335,000 shares of their Class B common stock to a voting trust, which were then exchanged for an equivalent number of Class F common stock.\nImmediately prior to the filing of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible\npreferred stock and convertible preferred stock were converted into 797,743,185 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, and all of the Company’s outstanding preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock warrants,\nwhich resulted in the reclassification of the warrants liability to additional\npaid-in\ncapital. Subsequent to the filing of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, there were no shares of\nredeemable convertible preferred stock or convertible preferred stock outstanding.\nFurthermore, upon the occurrence of the Direct\nListing, the Company determined that the performance-based vesting condition was satisfied for 68,149,214 RSUs, which resulted in the issuance of an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. See further discussion in\nNote 12.\nStock-Based Compensation\nregarding the cumulative stock-based compensation charge recognized upon the Direct Listing.\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding annual financial reporting. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palantir\nTechnologies Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company holds at least a 20% ownership interest and has the ability\nto exercise significant influence over the investee, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. For such investments, the share of the investee’s results of operations is included as a component of other income\n(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and the investment balance is included in other assets and classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure\n119\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements,\nand the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made in the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, identification of performance obligations in customer contracts, the fair value of common stock and other assumptions used to measure stock-based compensation, the fair\nvalue of warrants, the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, collectability of accounts receivable, useful lives of tangible assets and the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases. Estimates and judgments are based on\nhistorical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences could affect the Company’s\nfinancial position and results of operations.\nSegments\nThe Company has two operating segments, commercial and government, which were determined based on the manner in which the chief operating\ndecision maker (“CODM”), who is the chief executive officer, manages the operations of the Company for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating performance. Various factors, including the Company’s organizational and management\nreporting structure and customer type, were considered in determining these operating segments.\nThe Company’s operating segments are\ndescribed below:\nCash,\nCash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of\nthree months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consists of amounts invested in money market funds.\nRestricted cash primarily consists of cash and certificates of deposit that are held as collateral against letters of credit and guarantees\nthe Company is required to maintain for operating lease agreements, certain customer contracts, and other guarantees and financing arrangements.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance sheets\nthat sum to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\n120\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of an allowance for credit losses, if any. The Company generally grants\nnon-collateralized\ncredit terms to its customers. Allowance for credit losses is based on the Company’s best estimate of probable losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio and is determined based on\nexpectations of the customer’s ability to pay by considering factors such as customer type (commercial or government), historical experience, financial position of the customer, age of the accounts receivable, current economic conditions,\nincluding the ongoing\nCOVID-19\npandemic, and as well as reasonable and supportable forward-looking factors about its portfolio and future economic conditions. Accounts receivable are\nwritten-off\nand charged against an allowance for credit losses when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. Based upon the Company’s assessment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, it\ndid not record an allowance for credit losses as probable losses are not expected to be material.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk and\nOther Concentrations\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk\nconsist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions.\nCash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any\nlosses on such amounts.\nThe Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable presented on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company’s accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $156.9 million and $50.3 million, respectively. Customer G represented 13% of total accounts receivable as of\nDecember 31, 2020. Customers A and C represented 38% and 21% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019, respectively. No other customer represented more than 10% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and\n2019. The Company seeks to mitigate its credit risk with respect to accounts receivable by contracting with large commercial customers and government agencies and regularly monitoring the aging of accounts receivable balances. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had not experienced any significant losses on its accounts receivable.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, Customer F, which is in the government operating segment, represented 10% of total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Customer D, which is in the commercial operating segment, represented 12%, and\n15% of total revenue, respectively. No other customer represented more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company relies on the technology, infrastructure, and software applications, including\nsoftware-as-a-service\nofferings, of third parties in order to host or operate certain key products and functions of its business.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing\nuse and when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) management commits to a plan to sell the asset, (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, (iii) the asset is being actively marketed for sale\nat or near its current fair value, (iv) significant changes to the plan of sale are unlikely, and (v) the sale of the asset is probable within one year. Upon classification as held for sale, long-lived assets are not depreciated, and the\nCompany evaluates the assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the fair value less costs to sell are less\n121\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nthan the carrying amount. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the Company records an impairment loss for the amount of the excess of carrying value over the fair value less costs to\nsell as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. See\nNote 4.\nFair Value Measurements\nfor more information.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recognized using the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are generally three years. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the\nestimated useful life, which is generally five years. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the assets are expensed when incurred. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation\nand amortization are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized.\nEquity Method Investments\nIn general, nonconsolidated investments in which the Company owns 20% to 50% of the affiliate’s equity and has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence but does not control are accounted for under the equity method. In making this determination, the Company first considers whether it has a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either the variable interest\nentity (“VIE”) model or the voting interest entity (“VOE”) model.\nThe Company adjusts the carrying value of its\ninvestment by its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the investee, adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions, impairment charges, dividends received, additional capital investments, and the\namortization of basis differences during the respective reporting period. The Company’s proportionate share of the net earnings or loss of its equity method investment is based on the most recently available financial statements of the investee\nand is reflected as a component of other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The income tax benefit or expense related to the Company’s interest in the net earnings or loss of the equity method investee is\nreported in the consolidated provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nThe Company reviews the investments for impairment whenever factors\nindicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the consolidated statements of operations. No impairment charge was recognized\nduring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future\ncash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. There was no impairment of long-lived assets recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019\nand 2018.\nLeases\nThe Company adopted the Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”)\n2016-02,\nLeases,\nand\nadditional ASUs issued to clarify and update the guidance in ASU\n2016-02\n(collectively, “ASC 842”), as of January 1, 2020. See the section\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nbelow\nfor more information.\n122\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement is or\ncontains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If a lease is identified, classification is determined at lease commencement. Operating lease liabilities are\nrecognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and therefore the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease\npayments. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over a similar term. Operating lease\nright-of-use\n(“ROU”) assets are based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before commencement, initial direct costs, and\nlease incentives. Renewals or early terminations are not accounted for unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Operating lease expense is recognized and the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and\nnon-lease\ncomponents, which are accounted\nfor as a single lease component. The Company elected to use the transition relief package of practical expedients but did not elect to use the hindsight practical expedient in determining a lease term and impairment of ROU assets at the adoption\ndate. For short-term leases, defined as leases with a term of twelve months or less, the Company elected the practical expedient to not recognize an associated lease liability and ROU asset. Lease payments for short-term leases are expensed on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease\nright-of-use\nassets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities,\nnon-current\non the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nare not material.\nLease accounting prior to the adoption of ASC 842\nFor operating leases, the Company recorded rent expense on a straight-line basis over the noncancelable lease term and recorded the difference\nbetween the rent paid and the recognition of rent expense as a deferred rent asset or liability. Rent escalation, rent abatement, or other concessions, such as rent holidays, and landlord or tenant incentives or allowances, were recorded as deferred\nrent and amortized over the remaining lease term.\nWarrants\nWarrants to purchase shares of redeemable convertible and convertible preferred stock (collectively, the “preferred stock warrants”)\nwere freestanding financial instruments classified as other noncurrent liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as the underlying securities were redeemable or contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of events which were\noutside of the Company’s control. The preferred stock warrants were recorded at their respective fair values upon issuance and were subject to\nre-measurement\nat the end of each reporting period. Any\nchange in the fair value of the preferred stock warrants was recognized as a change in fair value of warrants in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company adjusted the liability for changes in fair value of the preferred stock warrants\nuntil the completion of the Company’s Direct Listing. Immediately prior to the filing of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, all of the Company’s outstanding preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock\nwarrants, which resulted in the reclassification of the warrants liability to additional\npaid-in\ncapital.\nTreasury Stock\nRepurchased treasury stock is recorded at cost. When treasury stock is resold at a price different than its historical acquisition cost, the\ndifference is recorded as a component of additional\npaid-in\ncapital in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s treasury stock was fully retired as of April 2020. As of December 31, 2020 the\nCompany held no shares as treasury stock.\n123\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nThe Company measures fair value based on a three-level hierarchy of inputs, maximizing the use of observable inputs, where available, and\nminimizing the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s level within the three-level hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three-level\nhierarchy of inputs is as follows:\nLevel\n1\n: Observable inputs such as unadjusted, quoted prices\nin active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel\n2\n:\nObservable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\nLevel\n3\n: Unobservable inputs that\nare supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These inputs are based on the Company’s own assumptions about current market conditions and require significant management\njudgment or estimation.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other assets accounted\nfor at fair value, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and the warrants liability. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, assets held for sale, and the warrants liability are stated at fair value on a recurring basis. Accounts receivable, accounts\npayable, and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date. The carrying amount of the Company’s outstanding debt approximates the fair value\nas the debt bears a floating rate that approximates the market interest rate.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of subscriptions to access the software in the Company’s hosted environment with ongoing\noperations and maintenance (“O&M”) services (“Palantir Cloud”), software licenses, primarily term licenses in the customers’ environments, with ongoing O&M services\n(“On-Premises\nSoftware”), and professional services.\nIn accordance with Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n(“ASC 606”), the Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step revenue recognition model in accounting for its revenue arrangements:\n124\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nEach of the Company’s significant performance obligations and the Company’s\napplication of ASC 606 to its revenue arrangements is discussed in further detail below.\nPalantir Cloud\nThe Company’s Palantir Cloud subscriptions grant customers the right to access the software functionality in a hosted environment\ncontrolled by Palantir and are sold together with stand-ready O&M services, as further described below. The Company promises to provide continuous access to the hosted software throughout the contract term. Revenue associated with Palantir Cloud\nsubscriptions is recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis, which is consistent with the transfer of control of the Palantir Cloud subscription to the customer.\nOn-Premises\nSoftware\nSales of the Company’s software licenses, primarily term licenses, grant customers the right to use functional intellectual property,\neither on their internal hardware infrastructure or on their own cloud instance, over the contractual term and are also sold together with stand-ready O&M services. The O&M services include critical updates, support, and maintenance services\nrequired to operate the software and, as such, are necessary for the software to maintain its intended utility over the contractual term. Because of this requirement, the Company has concluded that the software licenses and O&M services, which\ntogether the Company refers to it as its\nOn-Premises\nSoftware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and represent a single distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Revenue is\ngenerally recognized over the contract term on a ratable basis.\nProfessional Services\nThe Company’s professional services support the customers’ use of the software and include, as needed,\non-demand\nuser support, user-interface configuration, training, and ongoing ontology and data modeling support. Professional services contracts typically include the provision of\non-demand\nprofessional services for the duration of the contractual term. These services are typically coterminous with a Palantir Cloud subscription or the\nOn-Premises\nSoftware. Professional services are\non-demand,\nwhereby the Company performs services throughout the contract period; therefore, the revenue is recognized over the contractual term.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of customer\nbilling and payment relative to the start of the service period varies from contract to contract; however, the Company bills many of its customers in advance of the provision of services under its contracts, resulting in contract liabilities\nconsisting of either deferred revenue or customer deposits (“contract liabilities”). Deferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Customer deposits\nconsist of payments received in advance of the start of the contractual term or for anticipated revenue generating activities for the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation and refund. The Company’s arrangements generally\ninclude terms that allow the customer to terminate the contract for convenience and receive a\npro-rata\nrefund of the amount of the customer deposit for the period of time remaining in the contract term after\nthe applicable termination notice period expires. In these arrangements, the Company concluded there are no enforceable rights and obligations after such notice period and therefore the consideration received or due from the customer that is subject\nto termination for convenience is recorded as customer deposits.\nThe payment terms and conditions vary by contract; however, the\nCompany’s terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from the invoice date. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the\n125\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\ntiming of payment, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient in accordance with ASC 606 to not adjust contract consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the\nCompany expects, at contract inception, that the period between when promised goods and services are transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods and services will be one year or less. As such, the Company determined its\ncontracts do not generally contain a significant financing component.\nAreas of Judgment and Estimation\nThe Company’s contracts with customers can include multiple promises to transfer goods or services to the customer. Determining whether\npromises are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately – or not distinct within the context of the contract and, thus, accounted for together – requires significant judgment. The Company concluded that the\npromise to provide a software license is highly interdependent and interrelated with the promise to provide O&M services and such promises are not distinct within the context of its contracts and are accounted for as a single performance\nobligation as the Company’s\nOn-Premises\nSoftware.\nAdditionally, the pricing of the\nCompany’s contracts is generally fixed; however, it is possible for contracts to include variable consideration in the form of performance bonuses, which can be based on subjective or objective criteria. The Company includes the estimated\namount of variable consideration that it expects to receive to the extent it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. Any amounts received in the form of performance bonuses were not material in the periods presented.\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition of contracts, including sales\ncommissions, and that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it is expected that the economic benefit and amortization\nperiod will be longer than one year. Costs to obtain contracts were not material in the periods presented. The Company recognizes an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a customer if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or\nenhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. Costs to fulfill contracts were not material in the periods presented.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue represents billings under noncancelable contracts before the related product or service is transferred to the customer. The\nportion of deferred revenue that is anticipated to be recognized as revenue during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, noncurrent.\nCustomer Deposits\nCustomer deposits consist of payments received for anticipated revenue generating activities in advance of the start of the contractual term or\nfor the portion of a contract term that is subject to cancellation and refund. The portion of customer deposits that is anticipated to be recognized as revenue during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as customer deposits and the\nremaining portion is recorded as customer deposits, noncurrent.\n126\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily includes salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing O&M and\nprofessional services, as well as third-party cloud hosting services, allocated overhead, and other direct costs.\nSoftware\nDevelopment Costs\nThe Company evaluates capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of\ntechnological feasibility. Based on the Company’s product development process and substantial development risks, technological feasibility is established for the Company’s products when they are made available for general release.\nAccordingly, the Company has charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nCosts\nSales and marketing costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved\nin executing on pilots and performing other brand building activities, as well as third-party cloud hosting services for our pilots, marketing and sales event-related costs, and allocated overhead. The Company generally charges all such costs to\nsales and marketing expense in the period incurred.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs primarily include salaries, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for personnel involved in performing\nthe activities to develop and improve the Company’s platforms, as well as third-party cloud hosting services, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, disputes, legal proceedings, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when\nit is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Recoveries of such legal costs from\ninsurance policies are recorded as an offset to legal expenses in the period they are received.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions\nof GAAP, which require compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. The Company determines the fair value of stock-based awards granted or modified on the grant date or\nmodification date using appropriate valuation techniques.\nService-Based Vesting\nThe Company grants stock option awards and RSUs, that vest only based upon the satisfaction of a service condition. For stock option awards,\nthe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock options granted. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying\ncommon stock, the expected term of the\n127\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\noption, the expected volatility of the price of the common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value\nof the option awards represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. For RSUs, the Company determines the grant-date fair value of the RSUs as the fair\nvalue of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for stock options and RSUs that vest only based upon the satisfaction of a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period, which is generally four years. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nPerformance-Based Vesting\nThe Company grants awards, including RSUs and “growth units,” that vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a\nperformance condition. The performance-based vesting condition for the RSUs granted prior to the Company’s Direct Listing was satisfied upon the occurrence of the Direct Listing. The service-based vesting period for growth units has been\nsatisfied for all growth units outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The performance-based vesting condition will be satisfied if the recipient remains a service provider through the\n180-day\nperiod\nfollowing the Direct Listing. Alternatively, if the holder of the growth units leaves the Company before the date of the public listing plus 180 days, then the growth units will vest if the Company meets certain performance targets for the\nperformance year. Unless determined otherwise by the Company, if a change in control of the Company occurs before vesting, the growth units are forfeited.\nEmployee Benefit Plan\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k)\ntax-deferred\nsavings plan for all employees who meet certain eligibility\nrequirements. Participants may contribute, on a pretax and\npost-tax\nbasis, a percentage of their qualifying annual compensation, but not to exceed a maximum contribution amount pursuant to Section 401(k)\nof the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may make additional matching contributions on behalf of the participants. The Company did not make matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe\nCompany estimates its current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets, which are estimated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. In\ngeneral, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or\ncredit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, the realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets are dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions, losses, and credits can be utilized.\nThe Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and recognizes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a\nfuture benefit on such deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance, when recorded, would be included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Management’s judgment is required in determining\nthe Company’s valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an\nuncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the\n128\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being\nrealized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in its provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes significant\nchanges to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense; creation of new minimum taxes, such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax\n(“BEAT”) and Global Intangible\nLow-Taxed\nIncome (“GILTI”) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which\nresulted in a one time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the United States (“Transition Tax”). A majority of the provisions in the Tax Act were effective January 1, 2018. The Company\nhas elected to record taxes associated with GILTI as period costs if and when incurred.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common\nStockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share attributable to its common stockholders using the\ntwo-class\nmethod required for participating securities, which determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and\nparticipation rights in distributed and undistributed earnings. The\ntwo-class\nmethod requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating\nsecurities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company’s redeemable convertible and convertible preferred stock contractually entitled the holders of such shares to\nparticipate in dividends, but do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, net losses for the periods presented were not allocated to these securities.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A, Class B, and Class F common stock\n(collectively, the “common stock”) are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting net\nloss per share will, therefore, be the same for all classes of common stock on an individual or combined basis. As such, the Company has presented the net loss attributed to its common stock on a combined basis.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally the functional currency of the Company’s international subsidiaries is the local currency of the country in which they operate.\nThe Company translates the assets and liabilities of its\nnon-U.S.\ndollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Revenue and\nexpenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment and included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss).\nFor transactions that are not denominated in the local functional currency, the Company remeasures monetary\nassets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Transaction gains and losses from the remeasurement are recognized in other income (expense), net within the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nUnder the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies (“EGC”) can delay adopting new or\nrevised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act\n129\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nuntil such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company elected to retain the ability to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting\nstandards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that the Company (i) is no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended\ntransition period provided in the JOBS Act. The Company lost its emerging growth company status on December 31, 2020 as its annual gross revenue exceeded the EGC revenue criteria of $1.07 billion. As such the Company became subject to new\naccounting pronouncement effective dates for\nnon-EGC’s\nduring 2020.\nThe Company adopted the\nfollowing accounting standards during the year ended December 31, 2020:\nASU\n2018-13,\nFair\nValue Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\nThis standard update modified the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding\ncertain disclosures. The ASU eliminated such disclosures as the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The ASU adds new\ndisclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. The Company adopted ASU\n2018-13\nas of January 1, 2020. The Company’s disclosures related to its Level 3 financial instruments did not\nmaterially change for the periods presented. See\nNote 4. Fair Value Measurements\nfor more information.\nASU\n2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842).\nASC 842 requires companies to generally recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding ROU assets on their balance sheet. Leases will be classified as\nfinance or operating leases, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the consolidated statements of operation. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this new standard prospectively using a\nmodified retrospective transition approach. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance of the new standard, which allowed the Company to carry forward its historical assessment on whether a\ncontract is or contains a lease, lease classification, and initial direct costs. Upon adoption on January 1, 2020, the Company recognized operating lease ROU assets of $234.1 million, and current and\nnon-current\noperating lease liabilities of $43.3 million and $237.2 million, respectively. Finance lease assets and liabilities were not material. The adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material\nimpact to Company’s consolidated statements of operations and cash flows from operations.\nASU\n2018-15,\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other –\nInternal-Use\nSoftware – (Subtopic\n350-40):\nCustomer’s\nAccounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.\nThis standard update requires a customer in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract to follow the\ninternal-use\nsoftware guidance in ASC\n350-40\nto determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. The Company adopted this guidance as\nof January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. Upon the adoption, the Company capitalized $4.0 million of software implementation costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, which were included in prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nASU\n2016-13,\nFinancial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nThis standard update, along with subsequent ASUs, replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with an expected credit loss model for which\na company recognizes an allowance based on the estimate of expected credit loss. The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n130\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU\n2019-12,\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic\n740)\n, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures but does not expect it to have a material impact.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nContract Balances\nThe Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and customer deposits. The changes in the Company’s contract\nliabilities were as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nBillings include $75.0 million at December 31, 2019 from Palantir\nTechnologies Japan, K.K. See\nNote 6. Equity Method Investments\nfor more information.\n(2)\nOther primarily includes the impact of foreign currency translation.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company’s arrangements with its customers often have terms that span over multiple years. However, the Company generally allows its\ncustomers to terminate contracts for convenience prior to the end of the stated term with less than twelve months’ notice. Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents noncancelable contracted revenue that has not yet been\nrecognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts that will be invoiced. The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original\nterms of twelve months or less. Cancelable contracted revenue, which includes customer deposits, is not considered a remaining performance obligation.\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations were $597.4 million as of December 31, 2020, of which the Company expects to\nrecognize approximately 54% as revenue over the next twelve months.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nSee\nNote 15. Segment and Geographic Information\nfor disaggregated revenue by customer segment and geographic region.\n131\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis\nand indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation (in thousands):\nCertificates of Deposit\nThe Company’s Level 2 instruments consist of restricted cash invested in certificates of deposit. The fair value of such instruments\nis estimated based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing services that utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or\nindirectly. These inputs include interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nGross unrealized gains or losses for\ncash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not material.\nAssets Held for Sale\nThe fair value of assets held for sale were determined based on the Company’s best estimate of fair market value considering the limited\nmarket conditions for the assets, recent comparable sales, the age and condition of the assets, current demand, including letters of intent for the sale of the assets, and the views of informed industry sources and third-party specialists. In\ndetermining the fair market value of the assets at December 31, 2019, the Company considered a letter of intent it executed with a prospective buyer during November 2019 and its costs to sell the assets. As a result, an impairment charge for\nthe excess of carrying value over the fair value less costs to sell was recorded as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. All assets held for sale were sold as of December 31, 2020.\n132\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the estimated fair value of the\nCompany’s assets held for sale (in thousands):\nWarrants Liability\nIn connection with the completion of the Company’s Direct Listing, all of the outstanding warrants to purchase shares of redeemable\nconvertible and convertible preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase shares of Class B common stock. As a result, the Company reclassified the warrants liability to additional\npaid-in\ncapital.\nImmediately prior to the Direct Listing and the reclassification to additional\npaid-in\ncapital, the fair value of the warrants liability was estimated using a Black Scholes model and considered the closing\nprice of the Company’s common stock on the first day of trading, the strike price of the warrants, the remaining term of the warrants, a risk-free interest rate that corresponds to the remaining term, and the volatility of comparable companies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the warrants liability was included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated\nbalance sheet and the fair value of the warrant liability was estimated using a combination of an option-pricing model and a Monte Carlo simulation model with equal weighting applied to both models in determining the fair values. These models\nconsidered many assumptions, including the likelihood of various potential liquidity events, the nature and timing of such potential events, actions taken with regard to the warrants at expiration, as well as discounts for lack of marketability of\nthe underlying securities and warrants.\nThe assumptions used to calculate the warrants liability as of September 29, 2020, the date\nimmediately before the Direct Listing, and December 31, 2019 were as follows:\n133\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the estimated fair value of the\nCompany’s warrants liability (in thousands):\n5. Balance Sheet Components\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment, net was $13.9 million,\n$12.2 million, and $13.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nAccrued\nLiabilities\nAccrued liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\n134\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n6. Equity Method Investments\nPalantir Technologies Japan, K.K.\nDuring November 2019, the Company and SOMPO Holdings, Inc. (“SOMPO”) created a Japanese Kabushiki Kaisha (“K.K.”), Palantir\nTechnologies Japan, K.K. (“Palantir Japan”) to distribute Palantir platforms to the Japanese market. Upon closing of the transaction with SOMPO, the Company purchased a total of 100,000 shares of Palantir Japan common stock for\n$25.0 million. The shares the Company received in exchange represent a 50% voting interest in Palantir Japan. The remaining 50% of the voting interest is held by SOMPO. The Company’s investment in Palantir Japan is accounted for as an\nequity method investment as the Company is able to exercise significant influence over, but does not control, the investee. The Company recorded a $25.9 million initial investment in Palantir Japan, of which $0.9 million was related to\ndirect costs incurred in connection with the transaction. The Company’s 50% share of profits or losses generated from Palantir Japan are reported on a quarter lag. The Company recorded $1.7 million share of losses during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.\nConcurrently with the formation of Palantir Japan, the Company entered into a\nten-year\nlicense and services agreement with Palantir Japan for a limited\nnon-transferable\nright to resell the Company’s platforms and use certain of the\nCompany’s trademarks in exchange for $25.0 million and future quarterly royalty payments to be paid based on Palantir Japan’s net revenue. In addition, the Company received a prepayment of $50.0 million to be used toward future\nproducts or services provided by the Company to support the business operations and future deployments of the Company’s platforms by Palantir Japan (“service credit”).\nIn connection with the license rights sold to Palantir Japan, the Company recorded the receipt of the $25.0 million in deferred revenue\nwhich will be recognized over the term of the agreement. The Company recorded the $50.0 million service credit in deferred revenue, which will be utilized on an\nas-needed\nbasis and expires after five\nyears. In the event there was a dissolution of Palantir Japan in the first five years following its formation, any remaining service credit would be refunded by the Company to Palantir Japan. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nPalantir Japan utilized $4.2 million and $0 of the outstanding service credit, respectively.\n7. Debt\n2014 Credit Facility\nIn October 2014, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility which has been subsequently amended (the “2014 Credit\nFacility”). The 2014 Credit Facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, subject to certain adjustments, and incurs a commitment fee of 0.375% assessed on the daily average\nundrawn portion of revolving commitments. Interest and commitment fees are payable at the end of an interest period or at each three-month interval if the interest period is longer than three months.\nIn December 2019, the Company drew down the $150.0 million term loan and $150.0 million under the existing revolving credit\nfacility. The term loan portion of the 2014 Credit Facility was fully repaid and terminated, and the $150.0 million revolving credit facility remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019.\nIn June 2020, the Company amended the 2014 Credit Facility to include a new $150.0 million term loan, extend the maturity date to\nJune 4, 2023, and add an additional lender. Additionally, this amendment increased the minimum liquidity required to be maintained and provided the Company with an option to increase the total commitments by up to an additional\n$200.0 million, subject to the lenders’ approval. All other terms and conditions remained substantially the same upon the effectiveness of the amendment. Upon entering into this amendment, the Company drew down the total available term\nloan commitment of $150.0 million.\n135\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nIn July 2020, the Company entered into another amendment to the 2014 Credit Facility, which\nadded an additional lender and provided for an increase of $50.0 million to the revolving credit facility and a $50.0 million term loan. The incremental commitments were provided under the same terms as the existing commitments under the\n2014 Credit Facility. During July 2020, the Company drew down the additional available term loan of $50.0 million and repaid the $150.0 million outstanding revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $200.0 million of term loans outstanding under the 2014 Credit Facility and an additional\n$200.0 million undrawn revolving credit facility available. The 2014 Credit Facility is secured with substantially all of the Company’s assets.\nThe 2014 Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, and certain financial and nonfinancial covenants, including but\nnot limited to maintaining minimum liquidity of $50.0 million, and certain limitations on liens and indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the 2014 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.\n2019 Credit Facility\nOn December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “2019 Credit Facility”) with a\nsecond lender. The 2019 Credit Facility allowed for the drawdown of up to $250.0 million. Amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Facility incurred interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.0% per annum, subject to certain adjustments. Interest\nwas payable at the end of an interest period or at each three-month interval if the interest period was longer than three months. The 2019 Credit Facility also required the Company to maintain 50% of the aggregate revolving commitment in a specified\ncollateral account, which was reported in restricted cash, noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2019,\nthe Company had $250.0 million outstanding and elected to incur interest at three-month LIBOR plus 2.0%. In June 2020, the outstanding balance was fully repaid and the 2019 Credit Facility was terminated, which released all restrictions on the\ncash collateral.\nThe Company’s outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nFuture minimum payments of principal on the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020 were\nas follows (in thousands):\n8. Leases\nThe Company has operating leases primarily for corporate office space, and equipment. Certain lease agreements contain renewal options, rent\nabatement, and escalation clauses that are factored into our determination of lease\n136\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\npayments when appropriate.

The Company may from time to time also be subject to various legal or government claims, disputes, or investigations. Such matters may include, but not be limited\nto, claims, disputes, allegations, or investigations related to warranty; refund; breach of contract; breach, leak, or misuse of personal data or confidential information; employment; government procurement; intellectual property; government\nregulation or compliance (including but not limited to anti-corruption requirements, export or other trade controls, data privacy or data protection, cybersecurity requirements, or antitrust/competition law requirements); securities; investor;\ncorporate; or other matters. The Company is unable to predict whether or when any such matters may arise, the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate legal and financial liability, and cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nat this time and accordingly has not accrued a related liability.\nOn December 14, 2017, members of KT4 Partners LLC (Managing Member\nMarc Abramowitz) and Sandra Martin Clark, as trustee for the Marc Abramowitz Irrevocable Trust Number 7 (together, “KT4 Plaintiffs”) filed an action in the Delaware Superior Court against the Company and Disruptive Technology Advisers LLC.\nThe complaint alleges tortious interference with prospective economic advantage and civil conspiracy in connection with a potential sale of stock by the KT4 Plaintiffs to a third party. The KT4 Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages,\ninterest, fees, and costs.\nOn August 30, 2019, BTIG, LLC (the “BTIG Plaintiff”), the alleged broker of the potential sale\nof stock that is the subject of the KT4 Plaintiffs’ December 2017 action, filed an action in the Delaware Superior Court against the Company and Disruptive Technology Advisers LLC. The complaint alleged tortious interference with prospective\neconomic advantage and civil conspiracy in connection with the same potential sale of stock at issue in the KT4 Plaintiffs’ action by a group of sellers purportedly represented by the BTIG Plaintiff to a third party. The BTIG Plaintiff\ndismissed its claim with prejudice on January 21, 2021.\nThe Company believes the lawsuit brought by the KT4 Plaintiffs is without\nmerit and is vigorously defending itself against it. Given the uncertainty of litigation it may be reasonably possible that the Company will incur a loss with regards to the matter; however, it cannot currently estimate a range of possible losses.\nAccordingly, the\n139\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCompany is unable at this time to estimate the overall effects that may result from the remaining case on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company was not aware of any currently pending legal matters or claims, individually or in the\naggregate, that are expected to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nWarranties and\nIndemnification\nThe Company generally provides a warranty for its software products and services and a service level agreement\n(“SLA”) for the Company’s performance of software operations via its O&M services to its customers.

The 2010 Plan permitted the granting of incentive stock options (“ISOs”),\nnon-statutory\nstock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”),\nrestricted stock, RSUs, and growth units to eligible participants. Under the 2010 Plan, the exercise price of options granted generally was at least equal to the fair market value of the applicable class of the Company’s common stock on the\ndate of grant. Options and other equity awards become vested and, if applicable, exercisable based on terms determined by the Board of Directors or other plan administrator on the date of grant (or per later modification). Under the 2010 Plan,\nunless provided otherwise for an applicable award, the vesting and exercisability of awards accelerates by 25% on a change in control, if the award holder remains a service provider as of or immediately prior to such event.\nThe 2010 Plan was terminated prior to the Company’s Direct Listing, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 Plan.\nHowever, the 2010 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted under the 2010 Plan.\n2020 Executive Equity Incentive Plan\nIn August 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2020 Executive Equity Incentive Plan (the “Executive Equity\nPlan”).

The term of an ISO generally may not exceed ten years. Additionally, the exercise price of any ISO granted to a 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the common stock\non the date of grant, and the term of such option grant shall not exceed five years. Options and other equity awards become vested and, if applicable, exercisable based on terms determined by the Board of Directors or another plan administrator on\nthe date of grant, which is typically four years for new employees and varies for subsequent grants.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except share and per share\namounts):\n(1)\nIncludes options that were canceled and\nre-granted\nas part of the option repricing modification, as further discussed below.\n143\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and exercisable\nis calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the fair value of the Company’s common stock as of December 31, 2020. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $974.2 million, $90.7 million, and $49.0 million, respectively, and is calculated based on the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the Company’s common stock as\nof the exercise date.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019,\nand 2018 was $2.57, $3.67, and $3.81 per share, respectively. The total grant-date fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $214.7 million, $229.4 million, and $221.2 million,\nrespectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized expense related to options outstanding was $1.1 billion, which is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average service period of 8.06 years.\nDetermination of Stock Option Fair Value\nThe estimated grant-date fair value of all the Company’s stock-based option awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model, based on the following assumptions:\n(1)\nExcludes the impact of repricing of stock options modified during the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. See the “Stock Option Modification” subsection below for further information.\nFair value of common stock\n– Prior to the Direct Listing, the fair value of the common stock underlying the options had\nhistorically been determined by the Company’s Board of Directors given the absence of a public trading market. The Board of Directors determined the fair value of the common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors,\nincluding: (i) third-party valuations of common stock and secondary market trading information; (ii) the prices, rights, preferences, and privileges of the preferred stock relative to those of the common stock; (iii) the lack of\nmarketability of the common stock; (iv) the actual operating and financial results; (v) the Company’s current business conditions and projections; and (vi) the likelihood of various potential liquidity events, such as an initial\npublic offering or sale of the Company, given prevailing market conditions. After the Direct Listing, the fair value of the common stock underlying the options was the Company’s closing stock price on the NYSE on the grant date.\nExpected volatility\n– As the Company recently completed its Direct Listing on September 30, 2020 and there is no sufficient\nstock volatility historical data, the expected volatility was based on the average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its industry peer group.\nExpected term\n– The expected term represents the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term\nassumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise period, and contractual lives of the options.\n144\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nExpected dividend yield\n– The Company has never paid and has no plans to pay\ndividends on its common stock. Therefore, the expected dividend yield assumption is zero.\nRisk-free interest rate\n– The\nrisk-free rate is based on the U.S. treasury\nzero-coupon\nissues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option.\nStock Option Modifications\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company modified 158,646,785 options held by then-current employees. In September 2018, the\nCompany repriced options held by then-current employees with an exercise price greater than $6.03 per share. As part of the repricing, the original options were canceled and new options were granted with an exercise price of $6.03 per share and a\nremaining contractual term of ten years. The new options were subject to the same service-based vesting schedule as the original options. The repricing was recorded as a stock option modification whereby the incremental fair value of each option was\ndetermined at the date of the modification and $43.7 million was immediately recognized related to vested options. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized total stock-based compensation expense of\n$11.9 million, $18.2 million, and $44.6 million, respectively, related to these repriced options.

The new options were subject to the same vesting schedule as the original options. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the\nCompany recognized total stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, there was remaining incremental fair value of $0.9 million which will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also modified 26,040,393 fully vested and outstanding options which were approaching\nexpiration.

The stock-based compensation expense related to such RSUs will be recognized using the accelerated attribution method from the\ngrant date. The service-based vesting period for these awards varies across service providers and is up to five years. The performance-based vesting condition for the RSUs was satisfied upon the Company’s Direct Listing, which occurred on\nSeptember 30, 2020. Additionally, subsequent to September 30, 2020 the Company granted RSUs with only a service based-based vesting condition. The stock-based compensation expense related to such RSUs will be recognized ratably over the\nservice period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $940.0 million in stock-based compensation\nexpense related to RSUs, of which $769.5 million was recognized upon the Company’s Direct Listing which satisfied the performance-based vesting condition.

The growth units have a formula used to calculate the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that would be earned by the holder upon the\nsatisfaction of all vesting criteria. The Company did not grant any additional growth units during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $9.6 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the\ngrowth units, of which $8.4 million was recognized upon the Company’s Direct Listing which satisfied the performance-based vesting condition. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nthe 3,582,674 growth units outstanding was $1.2 million, which the Company expects to recognize through March 2021 at which point the outstanding growth units will fully vest and convert into 1.5 million shares of common stock. No\ncompensation expense was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019 as the performance-based vesting condition was not achieved.\n146\nPalantir Technologies Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was as follows (in thousands):\nThe Company recognized a benefit for income taxes related to stock-based compensation expense for the years\nended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 of $18.2 million, $6.4 million, and $6.0 million, respectively.\nRelated Party\nNon-Recourse\nNote\nIn November 2016, the Company entered into a\nnon-recourse\npromissory note to lend an employee director $25.9 million, which was secured by 10,500,000 shares of the Company common stock held by the employee director (“pledged collateral”).\nSuch arrangement was accounted for as a stock option issued to the employee, and the Company recorded the related stock-based compensation expense upon the issuance of the note. The promissory note accrued interest at a rate of 1.5% per annum,\ncompounded semi-annually.\nIn August 2020, the Company received a payment of $26.6 million for a portion of the principal and accrued\ninterest on the outstanding\nnon-recourse\npromissory note in the form of 3,500,000 shares of common stock based on the fair market value of the common stock on the date of repayment.

Accordingly, in designing and\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us\nwith effective internal control over financial reporting."
