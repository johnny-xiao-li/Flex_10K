    "text": "Axon Enterprise, Inc. may be referred to as “the Company,” “Axon,” “we,” or “our.” We were incorporated in Arizona in September 1993 as ICER Corporation. We changed our name to AIR TASER, Inc. in December 1993 and to TASER International, Incorporated in April 1998. In January 2001, we reincorporated in Delaware as TASER International, Inc., and in April 2017, changed our name to Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nOur headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona houses our executive management, sales, marketing, certain engineering, manufacturing, finance and other administrative support functions. Our global software hub is located in Seattle, Washington, and we also have subsidiaries and / or offices located in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.\nOverview\nAxon’s mission is to protect life. We fulfill this mission through developing hardware and software products that advance our long-term strategic goals of a) obsoleting the bullet, b) reducing social conflict, c) enabling a fair and effective justice system, and d) building for racial equity, diversity, and inclusion. Our products solve some of society's most challenging problems and our mission attracts top talent.\n​\nAn axon is a nerve fiber that serves as the primary communication link in a nervous system — similarly, we see ourselves as building the nervous system for public safety. Our research & development (“R&D”) investments support continuous innovation on behalf of our customers. Our financial strategy is to build highly recurring, highly profitable businesses.\nAxon’s operations comprise two reportable segments:\nFurther information about our reportable segments and sales by geographic region is included in Notes 1 and 17 of the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For backlog by reportable segment, refer to Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey Product Category Revenue Drivers: What We Offer\nAxon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated bundles. Our key revenue drivers belong to three broad product categories:\n4\n​\n​\n​\n5\nSales and Distribution: Who We Sell To and Where We Deliver\nAxon’s direct sales force and strong customer relationships represent key strategic advantages. The majority of our revenues are generated via direct sales, including our online store, although we do leverage distribution partners and third-party resellers.\nNo customer represented more than 10% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nOur primary customer market is U.S. law enforcement. Of the approximately 18,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S., we have a customer relationship with approximately 17,000. Axon has dedicated sales representatives for the 1,200 largest agencies, which account for 70% to 80% of U.S. law enforcement patrol officers. The remaining agencies are served via our telesales team as well as distributors. Internationally, we began focusing on a direct sales strategy in 2017, and we have made significant investments over the past three years in building out our international direct sales force, particularly in Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America.\nIn 2019, we added sales personnel to capture law enforcement-adjacent markets, such as the U.S. federal government and military, domestic and international departments of corrections, and the fire and emergency medical services markets. In 2020, we also added dedicated sales personnel to support increased adoption of new products within law enforcement, specifically for Axon Air, AR / VR and Training, Axon Records, and Respond for Dispatch.\nGovernmental agencies generally have the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, for reasons including, but not limited to, non-appropriation of funds.\nResources\nManufacturing and Supply Chain\nWe perform light manufacturing, final assembly, and final test operations at our headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, and own substantially all of the equipment required to develop, prototype, manufacture and assemble our finished products. We have continued to maintain both our ISO 9001 and our ISO 9001:2015 certifications.\n6\nWe previously took steps to diversify our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint, which have positioned us well to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus far, we have been able to produce and ship our critical core products with little to no interruption. We have proactively built up a safety stock of raw and finished goods inventory aligned to our strategic model to help meet strong product demand while also preparing us to stagger factory work schedules as needed. We continue to adjust strategic inventory levels based on areas of risk to mitigate potential supply disruptions.\nIn light of our broad domestic and international geographic supplier base, we are continuously monitoring our supply chain to manage through potential impacts, finding alternate sources as well as shipping or logistic options as available or working with foreign regulators to ensure that our suppliers can provide parts.\nWe obtain many of our components from single source suppliers; however, because we own the injection molded component tooling used in their production, we believe we could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases without incurring significant production delays. For additional discussion of sources and availability of raw materials, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe provide limited manufacturer’s warranties on our CEDs and Axon devices, and customers also have the option to purchase extended warranties. For additional information about our warranties, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property\nWe protect our intellectual property with U.S. and international patents and trademarks. Our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations and laws to protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, we hold 223 U.S. patents, 89 U.S. registered trademarks, 137 international patents, and 333 international registered trademarks, and also have numerous patent and trademark applications pending. We are constantly innovating across all of our platforms, including on the TASER platform, and in 2020, we filed more patent applications related to TASER 7 alone than there are TASER patents expiring in the next few years due to age.\nWe continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors’ operations in particular countries and regions, our strategic technology or product directions in different countries, and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions. We have the exclusive rights to many Internet domain names, primarily including “TASER.com”, “Axon.com”, “Axon.net”, “Evidence.com” and “Axon.io.” We also vigorously protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party infringement.\nConfidentiality agreements are used with employees, consultants and key suppliers to help ensure the confidentiality of our trade secrets.\nCompetition\nTASER for Law Enforcement, Corrections and Private Security Markets:\nOur CEDs compete with a variety of other less-lethal alternatives to firearms, including rubber bullets or rubber baton rounds, pepper spray, mace, traditional stun guns, hand-held remote restraint devices involving a tether, laser dazzlers that cause temporary blindness, stun grenades, long-range acoustic devices, police batons and night sticks. TASER devices offer advanced technology, versatility, portability, effectiveness, built-in accountability systems, and low injury rates, which enable us to compete effectively against other less-lethal alternatives. TASER devices also offer connectivity to our cloud network, which allows agencies to more effectively manage their less-lethal programs and automate use-of-force reporting.\nThe primary competitive factors in this market include a device’s accuracy, effectiveness, reputation, safety, cost, ease of use, and exceptional customer experience. The design maturity of the TASER platform, as well as our\n7\ndevelopment and sale of a two-shot device, are also key competitive differentiators. We are aware of competitors providing competing CED products primarily in international markets.\nTASER for Personal Safety:\nIn the private citizen market, TASER devices compete with firearms and with other less-than-lethal self-defense options such as stun guns and pepper spray-based products including pepper guns and miniature spray cans. The TASER StrikeLight competes in the flashlight category, in which there are dozens, if not hundreds, of competitors, including tactical flashlight providers with and without stun-gun capabilities.\nTASER devices are not stun guns, and have different capabilities, including NMI (neuro-muscular incapacitation) functionality. The broader market for personal safety and home defense is far-reaching, and categories range from threat detection and accountability (dash and doorbell cameras), to home security (home alarms, locks, and response services) to personal defense (firearms, stun guns, TASER devices, pepper spray, tactical flashlights, and personal alarms).\nThe primary benefit of TASER devices is in less-than-lethal stopping power. Other competitive factors include a device’s cost, effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and available training options.\nSensors — Connected Cameras and Digital Evidence Management Software:\nThe body-worn camera and in-car video/ALPR market is highly competitive. Our competition includes Motorola Solutions, WatchGuard, Edesix, and Vigilant, all three of which Motorola purchased in 2019, Utility Associates, Getac, Panasonic Corp., Reveal Media, Coban Technologies, L3 Mobile-Vision, Digital Ally, Visual Labs, Intresnsic, LLC, as well as Safety Vision, Rekor, and Genetec.\nThe market for software solutions to improve public safety agency workflows is both highly fragmented and highly competitive. Our cloud-based digital evidence management system, Axon Evidence, competes with both cloud-based platforms and on-premises based systems designed by third-parties or developed internally by an agency's technology staff.\nKey competitive factors in this market include product performance, product features, battery life, product quality and warranty, total cost of ownership, data security, data and information work flows, company reputation and financial strength, and relationships with customers.\nProductivity and Real-Time Operations — RMS and CAD:\nThe RMS and CAD markets are highly competitive and highly fragmented. We have identified more than 50 software providers, including Motorola Solutions, Tyler Technologies, Central Square Technologies (formerly Superion, TriTech and Aptean), Northrop Grumman, Hexagon AB, Niche Technology Inc., Caliber Public Safety (parent, Harris Systems USA), Saab, SOMA Global, RapidDeploy, Sopra Steria, and Mark 43 Inc. In addition, not all law enforcement agencies use software for report writing — some still use paper. We believe our network of camera sensors and digital evidence management platform give us a strategic advantage in these product categories.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced higher net sales in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due primarily to municipal budget cycles. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact the cadence of net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Municipal law enforcement budgets tend to feature a mix of fiscal years that end in either June, September or December. However, historical seasonal patterns, municipal budgets or historical patterns of product introductions should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net sales or financial performance.\nGovernmental Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including, for example, laws and regulations related to: privacy and data protection, security, retention, and deletion; rights of publicity; content; intellectual property; regulation of our CEDs as firearms; advertising;\n8\nmarketing; distribution; electronic contracts and other communications; competition; consumer protection; telecommunications; product liability; taxation; labor and employment; economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions; securities; and online payment services. There are a number of legislative proposals in the U.S., at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties. Foreign laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the U.S.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.\nTASER and Axon Devices\nFor our TASER products, we rely on the opinions of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including the determination that a device that does not expel projectiles by the action of an explosive is not classified as a firearm.\nFederal regulation of sales in the U.S.:\nOur CEDs are not firearms regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but our consumer products are regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. There are currently no federal laws restricting sales of our core CED products in the U.S.\nAxon devices using lithium batteries are subject to U.S.-DOT/UN 38.3 for transportation.\nOur CED products are also subject to testing, safety and other standard organizations such as the American National Standards Institute, the International Electrotechnical Commission, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Underwriters Laboratories. These regulations also affect CEDs with Axon Signal technology, including Signal Performance Power Magazine technology, and TASER 7 battery packs.\nFederal regulation of international sales:\nOur CEDs are considered a “crime control” product by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) for export directly from the U.S. Consequently, we must obtain an export license from the DOC for the export of our CED devices from the U.S. to any country other than Canada.\nFederal regulation of foreign national employees:\nOur intangible CED production is also considered controlled “technology” by the U.S. DOC and is categorized as a “deemed export” for any foreign national employees exposed to the technology within the U.S. Consequently, we must obtain an export licenses from the DOC for any deemed export within the U.S. made to a foreign national employee exposed to the deemed controlled technology. Deemed export licenses are subject to DOC approvals and issued licenses require annual status reports for the stated employees.\nState and local regulation:\nOur CEDs are controlled, restricted or, less frequently, prohibited by a number of state and local governments. As of December 31, 2020, the general public in Hawaii and Rhode Island is prohibited from possessing certain of our TASER-branded devices. Some cities and municipalities also prohibit private citizen possession or use of our CED products.\nInternational regulation of foreign imports and sales:\nCertain jurisdictions prohibit, restrict, or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of CEDs, including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, limiting our international sales opportunities.\nU.S. and International regulation of component movements globally:\nWe rely on a global supply chain of components across our product lines with most final assembly occurring in the U.S. Export of these components from abroad is subject to shifting regulatory landscapes imposed by both the foreign government and U.S. authorities upon import.\nInternational regulation of foreign-based operations:\nWe maintain foreign operations in several countries globally for purposes of logistics, sales, and R&D support. Depending on these activities, regulations can include\n9\nbusiness activity licensing and registration, import permits and recordkeeping, warehousing & storage security and permitting, and government reporting.\nRadio Spectrum Devices\nCertain of our products utilize the radio spectrum to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of spectrum is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates spectrum use by non-federal entities and federal entities. Similarly, countries around the world have one or more regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for use of radio spectrum and electromagnetic interference, pursuant to their respective national laws. We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies.\nAxon body worn cameras, docks, fleet vehicle cameras and signal devices are subject to FCC’s rules and regulations. The FCC regulates not only the \"intentional radiation\" of radio transmitters, but also the \"unintentional radiation\" of noise from all sorts of electrical equipment. Current Axon products use Bluetooth, WiFi and/or Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) radio technologies. With the integration of LTE technologies, we must also apply for the approval of private certifications such as Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association certification, required by FirstNet and other operators. These regulations affect CEDs with Signal technology, including the TASER 7, SPPM, and future CEDs implementing wireless technology.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of such products.\nThe European Union (“EU”) has published Directives on the restriction of certain hazardous substances in electronic and electrical equipment (the “RoHS Directive”) and on electronic and electrical waste management (the “WEEE Directive”). The RoHS Directive restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead. The WEEE Directive directs members of the EU to enact laws, regulations, and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection, recycling, treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the EU. In addition, similar environmental legislation has been enacted in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. (under federal and state laws) and other countries.\nIn addition, the EU has defined a regulation for the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals that places responsibility on companies to manage the risks from chemicals contained in products and to provide safety information about such substances. Manufacturers and importers are required to gather information on the properties of the chemical substances in their products and provide for their safe handling. As of January 5, 2021, companies supplying products on the EU market containing substances of very high concern as identified by the EU have to submit information on these products to the European Chemicals Agency. The information in their database is then made available to waste operators and consumers.\nPrivacy Regulations\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, in 2016, the EU and the U.S. agreed to an alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the U.S., called the Privacy Shield Framework. However, in 2020, the EU’s Court of Justice invalidated the use of this framework moving forward. The court ruled that the framework did not ensure an adequate level of protection for data transferred from the EU to the U.S. Notably, there are alternative legal mechanisms available that allow the compliant transfer of data from the EU to the U.S., however, they may also be challenged by national regulators or private parties.\nThe European General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") took effect in May 2018 and applies to many of our products and services that provide service in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies\n10\nthat receive or process personal data of residents of the EU. The GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur success depends on the continued service of our employees and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate top talent. To facilitate this, we strive to create a diverse and inclusive environment at Axon, with equitable opportunities for employee growth and development, supported by strong compensation and benefits and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. Axon’s mission is central to our recruiting and retention efforts.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,710 full-time employees and 838 temporary employees (temporary employees include contractors, interns, and consultants). The breakdown of our full-time employees by department was as follows: 260 direct manufacturing employees, 475 research and development employees, 458 administrative and manufacturing support employees and 517 employees within sales, marketing, communications and training. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are strong.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the number of full-time employees increased by approximately 380, primarily due to increases in engineering resources as well as sales. We closed the year with our regrettable attrition rate\n(b)\nunder 5% and with 94% of employees responding to an internal survey stating they were proud to work at Axon.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe embrace diversity, equity and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse, leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences, and ensure that all employees are equitably empowered to succeed. We continue to focus on the hiring, retention, development, and advancement of women and underrepresented communities. We are focused on recruiting diverse candidates and on internal talent development of our diverse leaders so that they can advance their careers and move into leadership positions.\nOur employee affinity groups are company-sponsored, employee-led communities that address specific needs, priorities, and barriers to success for each community of focus. These groups provide a forum for employees to discuss problems and craft solutions for each community of focus, while also creating leadership and professional development opportunities for members. As of December 31, 2020, we had four affinity groups — Axon Allies for LGBTQ+ employees and allies, Axon Mosaic for Black employees, Axon Vets for service veterans, and Women at Axon.\nIn 2020, we broadened our already strong support for our customers and the communities they are sworn to protect. We added a Vice President of Community Impact to build and lead a team dedicated to listening to communities, seeking citizen feedback, and keeping them safe and informed on a variety of topics. We also launched a company-wide R&D initiative that allowed employees to break from their regular responsibilities and solely focus on developing life-changing solutions to better protect citizens and law enforcement. Internally, we took time to listen to our employees with town hall sessions and, after intentional reflection, took action with employee affinity groups, provided expert-led webinars for parents, and hosted community round tables.\n​\n​\n​\n11\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is of utmost important to us. We conduct regular self-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective gear (e.g. eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have invested heavily to help ensure the health of our employees. Through the use of education and awareness, provision of necessary personal protective equipment, and changes to our manufacturing facilities and screening, we strive to make our workplaces a safe place for employees during the workday.\nTo promote mental and emotional wellbeing, all full time employees globally were provided free, unlimited access by Axon to Ginger. Ginger is a 24/7 resource that includes individualized coaching via text in addition to access to article and activities offering guidance on maintaining emotional balance throughout tumultuous times.\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those reports filed with or furnished to the SEC are available free of charge on our website at\nhttp://investor.axon.com\nas soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such material to the SEC.

    "text": "Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, our past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate our results or trends in future periods. You should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nStrategic Risks\nWe are materially dependent on acceptance of our products by law enforcement markets, both domestic and international. If law enforcement agencies do not continue to purchase and use our products, our revenues will be adversely affected.\nAt any point, due to external factors and opinions, whether or not related to product performance, law enforcement agencies may elect to no longer purchase our CEDs or other products.\nWe substantially depend on sales of our TASER CEDs, and if these products do not continue to be widely accepted, our growth prospects will be diminished.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we derived a significant portion of our revenues from sales of TASER brand devices and related cartridges, and expect to depend on sales of these products for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. A decrease in the selling prices of, or demand for these products, or their failure to maintain broad market acceptance, would significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\n12\nIf we are unable to design, introduce, sell and deploy new products or new product features successfully, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products or new product features that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner. These products include, but are not limited to, Axon Records, Axon Respond, and future generations of the TASER CED and Axon Body Cameras. The development of new products and new product features is complex, time consuming and expensive, and we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. We may choose to carry higher level of inventories to mitigate the risk of production delays, which may in turn expose us to an increased risk of obsolescence.\nWe are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based productivity and real-time operations SaaS solutions, which we intend to broadly deploy to a large number of customers. Customer requirements for these products are complex and varied. If we are unable to develop scalable solutions that can consistently be configured for customers with minimal effort, or if we are unable to build out a professional services team that can consistently configure our products to meet the requirements of large numbers of customers  in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to broadly scale our cloud-based productivity and real-time operations SaaS solutions could be negatively impacted, and our deployment costs could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that products that we may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance. If we fail to develop new products or new product features on a timely basis that achieve market acceptance, our business, financial results and competitive position could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks associated with rapid technological change and new competing products.\nThe technology associated with law enforcement devices and software is receiving significant attention and is rapidly evolving. While we have some patent protection in certain key areas of our CED, Axon device and SaaS technology, it is possible that new technology may result in competing products that operate outside our patents and could present significant competition for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to expand sales through direct sales and distributors and our inability to increase direct sales or recruit new distributors would negatively affect our sales.\nOur distribution strategy is to pursue sales through multiple channels with an emphasis on direct sales and independent distributors. We are focusing on direct sales to larger agencies through our regional sales managers and our inability to grow sales to these agencies in this manner could adversely affect our sales. Our inability to establish relationships with and retain law enforcement equipment distributors, who we believe can successfully sell our products, would adversely affect our sales. If we do not competitively price our products, meet the requirements of our distributors or end-users, provide adequate marketing support, or comply with the terms of our distribution arrangements, our distributors may fail to aggressively market our products or may terminate their relationships with us. These developments would likely have a material adverse effect on our sales. Our reliance on the sales of our products by others also makes it more difficult to predict our revenues, cash flow and operating results.\nIn certain states and foreign jurisdictions we have decided to pursue sales directly with law enforcement customers, rather than working through established distribution channels. Our customers may have strong working relationships with distributors and we may face resistance to this change. If we do not overcome this resistance and effectively build a direct relationship with our customers, sales may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and other strategic investments may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may consider additional acquisitions, joint ventures, or other strategic investments as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, expected synergies are not achieved, we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, we experience difficulty in the integration or coordination of new employees, business systems, and technology, we incur unanticipated liabilities or impairments, or there is a diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses. These events could harm our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\n13\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Patrick W. Smith, our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to retain executive officers, specifically Patrick W. Smith, and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, new product development, financial condition and operating results.\nOperational Risks\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nA disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, fire, explosion, failure to contain hazardous materials, industrial accident, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, public health crisis, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other mission-critical functions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results as well as expose us to claims, litigation and governmental investigations and fines.\nIn March 2020 the World Health Organization declared coronavirus (or “COVID-19”) a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread throughout the United States and world, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn. As an essential provider of products and services for law enforcement and other first responders, we remain focused on protecting the health and well-being of our employees while assuring the continuity of our business operations.\nCOVID-19-related risks that may affect our operations and financial results include, but are not limited to:\nThese events have had and could continue to have an impact on our operations. If our backup and mitigation plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption, our financial results could be adversely affected. We are continuously monitoring our operations and intend to take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so.\nHigher costs or unavailability of materials could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on certain domestic and international suppliers for the delivery of components used in the assembly of our products. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components or sub-assemblies and reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components and sub-assemblies. Specifically, we depend on suppliers of sub-assemblies, machined parts, injection molded plastic parts, printed circuit boards, custom wire fabrications and other miscellaneous customer parts for our\n14\nproducts. Although we have and are implementing additional long-term agreements with strategic suppliers to mitigate the risk of supply continuity, there remains risk across our supply chain while we extend our supplier contract program, and there is no guarantee that supply will not be interrupted.\nSingle or sole-source components used in the manufacture of our products may become unavailable or discontinued. Delays caused by industry allocations or obsolescence may take weeks or months to resolve. In some cases, parts obsolescence may require a product re-design to ensure quality replacement components. These delays could cause significant delays in manufacturing and loss of sales, leading to adverse effects significantly impacting our financial condition or results of operations and could injure our reputation.\nA significant number of our raw materials or components are comprised of petroleum-based products or incur some form of landed cost associated with transporting the raw materials or components to our facility. Our freight and import costs and the timely delivery of our products could be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of our operations, including: higher fuel costs; potential port closures; customs clearance issues; increased government regulation or regulatory changes for imports of foreign products into the U.S.; delays created by terrorist attacks or threats, public health issues, national disasters or work stoppages; and other matters. Any interruption of supply for any material components of our products could significantly delay the shipment of our products and have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition. For example, other industries are experiencing a significant shortage of semiconductors in their supply chains. We are tracking second-and third-level constraints and have taken steps to mitigate the potential impacts by building in buffers in our raw materials inventory and ensuring our suppliers have adequate access to raw material levels aligned to our forecasts. Disruptions in the semi-conductor supply chain could cause a disruption in our ability to make our products.\nInternational or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials or components and other government trade policies, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials or components, and could adversely impact the profitability of our operations. In particular, the implementation of tariffs and trade restrictions as well as changes in trade policies between the U.S. and China may have an adverse effect on our supply chain from a sourcing and cost perspective. We source certain raw materials from China, as do some of our suppliers. While we have actively implemented programs to increase buffer inventory levels as well as transition from China along with secondary sources of raw materials outside of China, future actions or events could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\nTo the extent demand for our products increases, our future success will be dependent upon our ability to manage our growth and to increase manufacturing production capacity, which may be accomplished by the implementation of customized manufacturing automation equipment.\nTo the extent demand for our products increases significantly in future periods, one of our key challenges will be to increase our production capacity to meet sales demand while maintaining product quality. Our primary strategies to accomplish this include introducing additional shifts, increasing the physical size of our assembly facilities, the hiring of additional production staff, and the implementation of additional customized automation equipment. The investments we make in this equipment may not yield the anticipated labor and material efficiencies. Our inability to meet any future increase in sales demand or effectively manage our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial results and financial condition.\nDelays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues and cash flows.\nThe development of CEDs, devices, sensors and software is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Our focus on our SaaS platform also presents complex development issues. Significant delays in new product or service releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\n15\nWe expend significant resources in anticipation of a sale due to our lengthy sales cycle and may receive no revenue in return.\nGenerally, law enforcement and corrections agencies consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products, including product benefits, training costs, the cost to use our products in addition to, or in place of, other products, budget constraints and product reliability, safety and efficacy. The length of our sales cycle may range from a few weeks to as long as several years. Adverse publicity surrounding our products or the safety of such products has in the past, and could in the future, lengthen our sales cycle with customers. In the past, we believe that our sales were adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding our products or the use of our products. We may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our products by potential customers before they place an order. If these potential customers do not purchase our products, we will have expended significant resources and received no revenue in return.\nChanges in civil forfeiture laws may affect our customers’ ability to purchase our products.\nSome of our customers use funds seized through civil forfeiture proceedings to fund the purchase of our products. Legislative changes could impact our customers’ ability to seize funds or use seized funds to fund purchases. Changes in civil forfeiture statutes or regulations are outside of our control and could limit the amount of funds available to our customers, which could adversely affect the sale of our products.\nIf our security measures or those of our third-party cloud storage providers are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customers’ data or our data, our network, data centers and service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of information or the total or partial deletion or encryption of all stored customer data, litigation and possible liability. We devote significant resources to engineer secure products and ensure security vulnerabilities are mitigated, and we require our third-party service providers to do so as well. Despite these efforts, security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, and malfeasance or otherwise. Breaches could occur during transfer of data to data centers or at any time, and result in unauthorized access to our data or our customers’ data. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data or our customers’ data. Additionally, hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack or gain access to our networks and data centers.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, grow more complex over time, and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Moreover, our security measures and those of our third-party service providers or customers may not detect such security breaches if they occur. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure that such measures will provide absolute security, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks.\nA security breach could expose us to a risk of loss or inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, or the denial of access to this data. A security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, disrupt our business, damage our reputation, lead to legal liability, negatively impact our future sales and significantly harm our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nDefects or disruptions in our services could impact demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.\nWe currently serve our Axon Evidence customers from third-party cloud storage providers based in the U.S. and other countries. Interruptions in our service, or loss or corruption of digital evidence, may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to file litigation against us, cause customers to terminate their\n16\nsubscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable.\nSince our customers use our services for important aspects of their operations, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers’ operations. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our warranty expense, an increase in collection cycles for and decline in the collectability of accounts receivable, and an increase in the expense and risk of litigation.\nDefects in our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance and damage to our reputation.\nComplex components and assemblies used in our products may contain undetected defects that are subsequently discovered at any point in the life of the product. Defects in our products could result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance, damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and competitive position.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant, and we plan to continue to grow internationally by acquiring existing entities or setting up new legal entities in new markets. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\nAdditionally, changes in international local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions may adversely harm our business and compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, environmental regulations, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others.\nOur business in the United Kingdom may be negatively impacted by the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU (commonly referred to as \"Brexit\"). The exit itself could negatively impact the United Kingdom and other economies, which could adversely affect sales of our products and services. We may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling, the euro and other European currencies. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and the EU, and we\n17\nmay incur additional costs or need to make operational changes as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain our key management, sales and technical personnel.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our key management personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified technical employees. Although we have employment agreements with our officers and other members of our executive management team, the employment of such persons is “at-will” and either we or the employee can terminate the employment relationship at any time, subject to the applicable terms of the employment agreements. The competition for our key employees is intense. The loss of the service of one or more of our key personnel could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nFinancial Risks\nAn increasing percentage of our revenue is derived from subscription billing arrangements which may result in delayed cash collections and may increase customer credit risk on receivables and contract assets.\nA growing portion of our sales are derived from subscription billing arrangements and on an open credit basis. While we record an estimate of expected credit losses and perform ongoing reviews of trade accounts receivables, if we become aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, we may have to adjust our expected credit loss reserve, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe may experience a decline in gross margins due to a shift in product sales from CEDs to software and sensors products and services which may continue to carry a lower gross margin.\nWe continue to invest in the growth of the Software and Sensors segment, and this expected growth may result in a higher percentage of total revenues being comprised of Software and Sensors products and services. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the Software and Sensors segment is currently lower than that of the TASER segment, and may continue to be lower in the future.\nSaaS revenue for Axon Evidence is recognized over the terms of the contracts, which may be several years, and, as such, trends in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nOur SaaS service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one to five years. As a result, most of the SaaS revenue we report each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, current positive or negative trends in this portion of our business may not be fully reflected in our revenue results for several periods.\nMost of our end-user customers are subject to budgetary and political constraints that may delay or prevent sales.\nMost of our end-user customers are government agencies. These agencies often do not set their own budgets and therefore, have limited control over the amount of money they can spend. In addition, these agencies experience political pressure that may dictate the manner in which they spend money. As a result, even if an agency wants to acquire our products, it may be unable to purchase them due to budgetary or political constraints, particularly in challenging economic environments. There can be no assurance that the economic, budgeting or political issues will not worsen and adversely impact sales of our products. Some government agency orders may also be canceled or\n18\nsubstantially delayed due to budgetary, political or other scheduling delays, which frequently occur in connection with the acquisition of products by such agencies, and such cancellations may accelerate or be more severe than we have experienced historically.\nDue to municipal government funding rules, certain of our contracts are subject to appropriation, termination for convenience, or similar cancellation clauses, which could allow our customers to cancel or not exercise options to renew contracts in the future.\nAlthough we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not appropriate money in future year budgets, terminate contracts for convenience or if other cancellation clauses are invoked, revenue and cash associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, and could result in a reduction to bookings and revenue.\nWe maintain most of our cash balances, some of which are not insured, at four depository institutions.\nWe maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents accounts at four depository institutions. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate balances in such accounts were $145.1 million. Our balances with these institutions regularly exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured limits for domestic deposits and various foreign deposit insurance programs covering our deposits in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.\nWe could suffer losses with respect to the uninsured balances if the depository institutions failed and the institution’s assets were insufficient to cover its deposits and/or the governments did not take actions to support deposits in excess of existing insurance limits. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nStock compensation expense may have a material, unpredictable impact on our results of operations.\nWe have historically granted and expect to continue to grant stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. All stock-based awards are required to be recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The amount recognized for stock compensation expense could vary depending on a number of assumptions or changes that may occur.\nFor awards containing multiple service, performance and market conditions, where all conditions must be satisfied prior to vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period, based on management’s estimate of the probability and timing of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. Changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimates of the fair value of the awards and timing of recognition of stock-based compensation expense and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nIf we achieve specific operational goals and the covered employees complete the requisite service conditions for  the performance-based awards with multiple service, performance, and market conditions, including our CEO Performance Award and our eXponential Stock Performance Plan (\"XSPP\"), we will recognize stock compensation expense regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved and the underlying tranches vest.\nOur financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.\nFor current and potential international customers whose contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, the relative change in local currency values creates relative fluctuations in our product pricing. These changes in international end-user costs may result in lost orders and reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain foreign markets. Additionally, intercompany sales to our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are transacted in U.S. dollars which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk caused by foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\n19\nFor non-U.S. dollar denominated sales, weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar generally leads us to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for our products. Should we decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar’s strengthening, the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings would be adversely affected. We do not currently engage in hedging activities. Fluctuations in foreign currency could result in a change in the U.S. dollar value of our foreign denominated assets and liabilities including accounts receivable. Therefore, the U.S. dollar equivalent collected on a given sale could be less than the amount invoiced causing the sale to be less profitable than contemplated.\nWe also import selected components which are used in the manufacturing of some of our products. Although our purchase orders are generally in U.S. dollars, weakness in the U.S. dollar could lead to price increases for the components.\nUnanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, and changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe are subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or change in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nOur tax provision could also be impacted by changes in federal, state or international tax laws including fundamental tax law changes applicable to corporate multinationals.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, city or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to:\n20\nAs a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful in the short term, and our performance in a particular period may not be indicative of our performance in any future period.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe may face personal injury, wrongful death and other liability claims that harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales and financial condition.\nOur CED products are often used in aggressive confrontations that may result in serious, permanent bodily injury or death to those involved. Our CED products may be associated with these injuries. A person, or the family members of a person, injured in a confrontation or otherwise in connection with the use of our products, may bring legal action against us to recover damages on the basis of theories including wrongful death, personal injury, negligent design, defective product or inadequate warning. We are currently subject to a number of such lawsuits and we have been subject to significant adverse judgments and settlements. We may also be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of misuse of our products. If successful, wrongful death, personal injury, misuse and other claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could result in negative publicity about our products. We incur significant legal expenses in defending these cases, and significant litigation could also result in a diversion of management’s attention and resources, negative publicity and a potential award of monetary damages in excess of our insurance coverage. The outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that our existing or any future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOther litigation may subject us to significant litigation costs and judgments and divert management attention from our business.\nWe have been or could in the future be involved in numerous other litigation matters relating to our products, contracts and business relationships, including litigation against persons whom we believe have infringed on our intellectual property, infringement litigation filed against us, litigation against a competitor, enforcement actions filed against us, and litigation involving the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). Such matters have resulted, and are expected to continue to result in, substantial costs to us, including in the form of attorneys’ fees and costs, damages, fines or other penalties, whether pursuant to a judgment or settlement, and diversion of our management’s attention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. There is also a risk of adverse judgments, as the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims, which could incur substantial litigation costs, result in significant damage awards, inhibit our use of certain technologies, and divert management attention from our business.\nMany companies own intellectual property rights that are directly or indirectly related to public safety technologies. These companies periodically demand licensing agreements or engage in litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of their patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets. Non-practicing entities also have patents they have been granted or otherwise acquired, including patents that are directly or indirectly related to public safety technologies. These entities may seek compensation for perceived infringement of their patents, including by filing claims against us, independent of the merit of any such claims. As we enter new markets, expand into new product categories, and otherwise offer new products, services, and technologies, additional intellectual property claims may be filed against us by these companies, entities, and other third parties. Additional intellectual property claims may also be filed against us as our current products, services, and technologies gain additional market share.\nIf our products, services, or technologies were found to infringe a third-party’s proprietary rights, we could be forced to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to be able to sell our products or discontinue use of the protected technology. Such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We could also be required to pay substantial damages, fines or other penalties, indemnify customers or distributors,\n21\ncease the manufacture, use, or sale of infringing products or processes, and/or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies. Our suppliers may not provide, or we may not be able to obtain, intellectual property indemnification sufficient to offset all damages, fines or other penalties resulting from any claims of intellectual property infringement brought against us or our customers. There is no guarantee that our use of conventional technology searching and brand clearance searching will identify all potential rights holders. Rights holders may demand payment for past infringements and/or force us to accept costly license terms or discontinue use of protected technology and/or works of authorship that may include, for example, photos, videos, and software. Our current research and development focus on developing software-based products, including that which is related to artificial intelligence, increases this risk.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and products may decrease and we may lose our competitive market advantage.\nOur future success depends upon our proprietary technology. Our protective measures for this proprietary technology include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret protection. However, these protective measures, as well as our efforts to pursue such protective measures, may prove inadequate. For example, the value of intellectual property protection in certain countries may not be apparent until after such protection can no longer be pursued. As such, our intellectual property protection may not extend to all countries in which our products are distributed or will be distributed in the future. Though we work to protect our innovations, we may not be able to obtain protection for certain innovations. For example, we may be unable to patent some software-based products. The scope of any patent protection we have obtained, or may obtain, may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. Despite our efforts, any intellectual property protection we obtain may be later determined to be insufficient or ineffective.\nOur protective measures may prove inadequate for reasons outside of our control. Different intellectual property laws between different countries may lead to differences in protection between such countries. In certain countries in which our products are distributed, the ability to effectively enforce intellectual property rights may not exist. Patent requirements differ by country and certain domestic or foreign laws may prohibit us from satisfying these requirements, creating a risk that some of our international patents may become unenforceable. Patents for older technologies, such as our M26 and X26E models of CEDs, have expired or will expire due to statutory limits on patent term. Despite policies and efforts to maintain secrecy, trade secrets and other confidential information we maintain, or may choose to maintain in the future, could be compromised by employees, partners, or other third parties.\nOnce established, there is no guarantee that our intellectual property rights will remain in force. Issued patents may be re-examined and subsequently ruled invalid or unenforceable. Our registered trademarks may also be diminished or lost. For example, there is a risk that our “TASER” trademark could become synonymous with the general product category of “conducted energy devices”. The right to stop others from misusing our trademarks and service marks in commerce depends, to some extent, on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. Our efforts to stop improper use, if insufficient, may lead to loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers.\nOur intellectual property may also be at risk if we are unable to defend from enforcement actions, such as that filed by the FTC against us regarding our acquisition of Vievu LLC from Safariland LLC on May 3, 2018. For additional discussion of this matter, refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If successful, the FTC is seeking a divestiture of Vievu along with Axon assets sufficient to stand up a viable competitor.\nInability to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our commercial efforts and competitive market advantage. Regardless of outcome, the prosecution of patent and other intellectual property claims is both costly and time consuming. Unauthorized use of our proprietary technology could divert our management’s attention from our business, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\n22\nInternationally, we can enforce patent rights only in the jurisdictions in which our patent applications have been granted.\nOur U.S. patents protect us from imported infringing products coming into the U.S. from abroad. We have made applications for patents in a few foreign countries; however, these may be inadequate to protect markets for our products in other foreign countries. Each patent is examined and granted according to the law of the country where it was filed independent of whether a U.S. patent on similar technology was granted. A patent in a foreign country may be subject to cancellation if the claimed invention has not been sold in that country. Meeting the requirements of working invention differs by country and ranges from sales in the country to manufacturing in the country. U.S. export law, or the laws of some foreign countries, may prohibit us from satisfying the requirements for working the invention, creating a risk that some of our international patents may become unenforceable.\nA variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs detailed in “Business – Government Regulation,”\nwe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, labor and employment, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.\nThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices.\nThe costs of compliance with these laws and regulation are high and are likely to increase in the future. Additionally, these laws and regulations, or any associated inquiries or investigations or other government actions, may delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nTASER and Axon Devices\nFor our TASER products, we rely on the opinions of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including the determination that a device that does not expel projectiles by the action of an explosive is not classified as a firearm. Changes in statutes, regulations, and interpretation outside of our control may result in our products being classified or reclassified as firearms. If this were to occur, our private citizen market could be substantially reduced because consumers would be required to comply with federal, state, or local firearm transfer requirements prior to purchasing our products.\nFederal regulation of sales in the U.S.:\nOur CEDs are not firearms regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but our consumer products are regulated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Although there are currently no federal laws restricting sales of our core CED products in the U.S., future federal regulation could adversely affect sales of our products.\nOur CED products are subject to regulation by testing, safety and other standard organizations. These regulations also affect CEDs with Axon Signal technology, including Signal Performance Power Magazine technology, and TASER 7 battery packs, and could impact future CEDs that feature wireless technology.\n23\nFederal regulation of international sales:\nOur CEDs are considered a “crime control” product by the U.S. DOC for export directly from the U.S which requires us to obtain an export license from the DOC for the export of our CED devices from the U.S. to any country other than Canada. Future products and services may require classifications from the DOC before they may be shipped internationally. Our inability to obtain DOC export licenses or classifications on a timely basis for sales of our products to our international customers could significantly and adversely affect our international sales.\nFederal regulation of foreign national employees:\nOur intangible CED production is also considered controlled “technology” by the U.S. DOC and is categorized as a “deemed export” for any foreign national employees exposed to the technology within the U.S. Consequently, we must obtain an export licenses from the DOC for any deemed export within the U.S. made to a foreign national employee exposed to the deemed controlled technology. Deemed export licenses are subject to DOC approvals and issued licenses require annual status reports for the stated employees. Inability to obtain proper licensing could curtail the company’s ability to execute R&D and production related to CED technology.\nState and local regulation:\nOur CEDs are controlled, restricted or, less frequently, prohibited by a number of state and local governments. Other jurisdictions may ban or restrict the sale of our CED products, or restrict their use through changes to use-of-force laws or regulations, and our product sales may be significantly affected by additional state, county and city governmental regulation.\nInternational regulation of foreign imports and sales:\nCertain jurisdictions prohibit, restrict, or require a permit for the importation, sale, possession or use of CEDs, including in some countries by law enforcement agencies, limiting our international sales opportunities.\nU.S. and International regulation of component movements globally:\nWe rely on a global supply chain of components across our product lines with most final assembly occurring in the U.S. Export of these components from abroad is subject to shifting regulatory landscapes imposed by both the foreign government and U.S. authorities upon import. Abrupt changes to these regulations can result in delays or interruptions to final product supplies.\nInternational regulation of foreign-based operations:\nWe maintain foreign operations in several countries globally for purposes of logistics, sales, and R&D support. Any failure to properly maintain or license could limit our ability to sell, support, or develop our products and services both internationally and in the U.S. market.\nRadio Spectrum Devices\nCertain of our products utilize the radio spectrum to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of spectrum is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users. We manufacture and market products in spectrum bands already made available by regulatory bodies. If current products do not comply with the regulations set forth by these governing bodies, we may be unable to sell our products or could incur penalties. Our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands may also require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.\nAxon body worn cameras, docks, fleet vehicle cameras and signal devices are subject to FCC’s rules and regulations. These regulations affect CEDs with Signal technology, including the TASER 7, SPPM, and future CEDs implementing wireless technology. Compliance with government regulations could increase our operations and product costs and impact our future financial results.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including restricting the presence of certain substances in our products and making us financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of such products. In addition, further environmental legislation may be\n24\nenacted in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. (under federal and state laws) and other countries, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.\nWe endeavor to comply with applicable environmental laws, yet compliance with such laws could increase our operations and product costs, increase the complexities of product design, procurement, and manufacturing, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, limit our sales activities, and impact our future financial results. Any violation of the various environmental regulations can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and prohibiting sales of our products into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPrivacy Regulations\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. If one or more of the legal mechanisms for transferring data from other countries to the U.S. is invalidated, if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results. Additional countries may pass legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and expose us to significant penalties for non-compliance."

    "text": "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\")  is designed to provide a reader of our consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Part I, Item 1A: “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing. The tables in the MD&A sections below are derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.\nThis section discusses our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018 please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.\nOverview\nAxon is a global network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer. With a mission of protecting life, our technologies give law enforcement the confidence, focus and time they need to protect their communities. Our products impact every aspect of a public safety officer’s day-to-day experience with the goal of helping everyone get home safe.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $681.0 million, an increase of $150.1 million, or 28.2%, from the prior year. We had a loss from operations of $14.2 million compared to $6.4 million in the prior year. The higher loss from operations was primarily the result of increased stock compensation expense for our CEO Performance Award and XSPP awards and an increase in legal expenses. Remaining cost increases were primarily attributable to the increase in unit sales and an increase in headcount. These cost increases were largely offset by higher revenue and improved gross margin. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net loss of $1.7 million compared to net income of $0.9 million for the prior year.\n2021 Outlook\nFor the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect revenue of $740 million to $780 million. We anticipate that revenue for the three months ending March 31, 2021 will reflect approximately 12% growth as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $65 million to $70 million in 2021, including approximately $25 million in support of capacity expansion and automation of TASER device and cartridge manufacturing, approximately $20 million for development of our planned\nnew manufacturing and office facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the remainder on investments to support our continued growth\n.\nCOVID-19\nIn late 2019, COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread throughout the United States and world, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn. As an essential provider of products and services for law enforcement and other first responders, we remain focused on protecting the health and wellbeing of our employees while assuring the continuity of our business operations.\nIn response to the pandemic, Axon has taken a number of actions:\nCustomer support:\n28\n​\nEmployee safety and manufacturing:\n​\nSupply chain:\n​\nShareholder engagement:\n​\nWe are in a strong liquidity position, with substantial cash and investments on hand, which are discussed in more detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe that our existing liquidity and other sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions or strategic investments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately $4.1 million for costs related to the pandemic. We expect ongoing increased costs related to the mitigation of contamination risk at our facilities. We expect these incremental costs will continue to be partially offset by savings on travel and events and other cost-savings measures.\n​\nWe have elected to participate in the social security deferral program offered under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, whereby we deferred payment of the employer portion of all social security taxes that would otherwise have been payable from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Payment of the deferred amount is due 50% on December 31, 2021 and 50% on December 31, 2022.\n29\n​\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents data from our consolidated statements of operations as well as the percentage relationship to total net sales of items included in our statements of operations (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nNet sales to the U.S. and other countries are summarized as follows (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nInternational revenue in 2020 increased substantially compared to 2019, driven by strength in all of our international regions and most notably within EMEA.\nOur operations are comprised of two reportable segments: the manufacture and sale of CEDs, batteries, accessories and extended warranties and other products and services (collectively, the “TASER” segment); and software and sensors, which includes the sale of devices, wearables, applications, cloud and mobile products, and services (collectively, the \"Software and Sensors\" segment). In both segments, we report sales of products and services. Service revenue in both segments includes sales related to Axon Evidence. In the TASER segment, service revenue also includes digital subscription training content. In the Software and Sensors segment, service revenue also includes other recurring cloud-hosted software revenue and related professional services. Collectively, this revenue is sometimes referred to as \"Axon Cloud revenue.\" Revenue from our “products” in the Software and Sensors segment are generally from sales of sensors, including on-officer body cameras, Axon Fleet cameras, other hardware sensors, warranties on sensors, and other products, and is sometimes referred to as \"Sensors and Other revenue.\" Within the Software and Sensors segment, we include only revenues and costs attributable to that segment which costs include: costs of sales for both products and services, direct labor, and product management and R&D for products included, or to be included, within the Software and Sensors segment. All other costs are included in the TASER segment.\n30\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet Sales\nNet sales by product line were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nNet unit sales were as follows:\n​\n​\nNet sales for the TASER segment increased $84.9 million, or 30.1%, primarily as a result of a net increase of $49.6 million in TASER device sales and a $29.2 million increase in cartridge revenue. Cartridge revenue increased due to increased unit sales, partially offset by a slight decrease in average selling price.\nWe continue to see a shift to purchases of our latest generation device, TASER 7, from legacy devices, especially X26P devices. Sales of our TASER 7 device also drove the increase in revenue from Axon Evidence and cloud services. Revenue was also impacted by higher average selling prices for TASER 7, X2, and X26P. Revenue from consumer TASER Pulse devices increased due to a substantial increase in volume, partially offset by lower average selling prices.\nNet sales for the Software and Sensors segment increased $65.3 million, or 26.2%. Revenue from Axon Evidence and cloud services increased $46.5 million as we continued to add users and associated devices to our network during\n31\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the aggregate number of users and devices also resulted in increased extended warranty revenues of $5.2 million. Revenue from Axon Body cameras increased $13.1 million following the introduction of our Axon Body 3 camera during the third quarter of 2019.\nBacklog - As of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nOur backlog for products and services includes all orders that have been received and are believed to be firm.\nIn the TASER segment, we define backlog as equal to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue represents amounts invoiced to customers for goods and services to be delivered in subsequent periods. We process orders within the TASER segment quickly, and our best estimate of firm orders outstanding as of period end represents those that have been invoiced but remain undelivered. The TASER segment backlog balance was $61.8 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect to realize $28.9 million of this deferred revenue balance as revenue during the next 12 months. This represents cash received and accounts receivable from customers on or prior to December 31, 2020 for products and services expected to be delivered in the next 12 months.\nIn the Software and Sensors segment, we define backlog as cumulative bookings, net of cancellations, less product and service revenue recognized to date. Bookings are generally realized as revenue over multiple years. The Software and Sensors backlog balance was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. This backlog balance includes $213.4 million of deferred revenue, and $1.2 billion that has been recorded as bookings but not yet invoiced, all as of December 31, 2020. We expect to realize approximately $370.0 million of the December 31, 2020 backlog balance as revenue during the next 12 months.\n​\n​\nOur backlog of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 has increased significantly from $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in TASER segment backlog is not expected to have a material impact on revenue or operating margins. Our significant increase in backlog, primarily in the Software and Sensors segment is indicative of expected revenue growth in this segment.\nCost of Product and Service Sales\nCost of product and services sales in dollars and as a percent of related segment sales (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nWithin the TASER segment, cost of product and service sales was $136.9 million, an increase of $29.7 million, or 27.7%, from 2019. Cost as a percentage of sales decreased to 37.4% from 38.1%. The increase in cost of sales was primarily a result of increased sales, with improvement to the cost as a percentage of sales primarily a result of\n32\nincreased leverage on manufacturing overhead expenses and higher expense in the prior year for TASER 7 ramp-up and optimization costs related to scrap, obsolete inventory, and higher labor costs.\nWithin the Software and Sensors segment, cost of product and service sales was $127.7 million, an increase of $11.4 million, or 9.8%, from 2019. As a percentage of net sales, cost of product and service sales decreased to 40.6% in 2020 from 46.7% in 2019. Cost of product sales increased $3.7 million primarily driven by the impact of increased units, but decreased as a percentage of total segment net sales, reflecting higher average selling prices on Axon cameras and docks, overall product mix, and relatively stable unit costs. Cost of service sales increased $7.7 million driven primarily by a $3.9 million increase in third party cloud data cost, and an increase in professional services expense due to increased deployments in 2020.\nGross Margin\nGross Margin (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nGross margin increased $109.0 million to $416.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $307.3 million for 2019. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased to 61.1% for 2020 from 57.9% for 2019.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross margin for the TASER segment increased to 62.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 61.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWithin the Software and Sensors segment, gross margin as a percentage of total segment net sales was 59.4% and 53.3% for the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. Within the Software and Sensors segment, product gross margin was 36.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 29.8% for the same period in 2019, while the service margins were 77.1% and 74.8% during those same periods, respectively.\nSales, General and Administrative Expenses\nSales, General and Administrative (\"SG&A\") Expenses (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nSG&A expenses increased $94.3 million, or 44.3%. Stock-based compensation expense increased $44.5 million in comparison to the prior year comparable period, which was primarily attributable to an increase of $41.5\n33\nmillion in expense related to the CEO Performance Award and XSPP.\nAs of December 31, 2020, eleven operational goals for the CEO Performance Award and XSPP are considered probable of attainment or have been attained; during the prior year comparable period, nine operational goals were considered probable.\nRefer to Note 13 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the CEO Performance Award and XSPP. Stock-based compensation expense also increased over the prior year comparable period due to an increase in headcount.\nProfessional, consulting and lobbying expenses increased $24.0 million, driven primarily by an increase of $19.1 million in expenses related to the FTC litigation. As discussed in Note 10 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on January 3, 2020, we sued the FTC in the District of Arizona, and the FTC filed an enforcement action regarding our May 2018 acquisition of Vievu LLC. Also contributing to the increase were higher expenses related to our\nenterprise resource planning system conversion.\nSalaries, benefits and bonus expense increased $15.7 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount. Salaries, benefits and bonus expense decreased as a percentage of sales from 12.7% for 2019 to 12.2% for 2020.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $3.5 million, driven by a $4.8 million increase in commissions tied to higher revenues. The increase was\npartially offset by savings driven by the cancellation of in-person events, including our annual Axon Accelerate user conference.\nOther SG&A expenses increased by $9.7 million, primarily driven by the following:\n​\nPartially offsetting the noted increases was a $5.8 million decrease in travel expenses following the suspension of all non-essential travel in mid-March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\") Expenses (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe increase in R&D expense was primarily attributable to our Software and Sensors segment. Within the TASER segment, R&D expenses increased $0.9 million or 6.3%,\nreflecting increased consulting expense and supplies in the current year related to the development of next generation products. The increase was partially offset by lower compensation and benefits resulting from decreased headcount.\n34\nR&D expense for the Software and Sensors segment increased $21.6 million or 25.0% but remained relatively consistent at 34.3% of sales as compared to 34.6% in the prior year. Of the increase, $9.1 million related to salaries, benefits, and bonus attributable to increased headcount.\nStock-based compensation expense increased $8.7 million. Contributing to the increase was expense of $3.8 million related to our XSPP.\nAs of December 31, 2020, eleven operational goals for the XSPP are considered probable of attainment or have been attained; during the prior year comparable period, nine operational goals were considered probable.\nStock-based compensation expense also increased over the prior year comparable period due to an increase in headcount.\nProfessional and consulting expenses increased $6.0 million related to development of next generation products.\nThe increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in travel and meals expense following the suspension of all non-essential travel in mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nWe expect R&D expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we focus on growing the Software and Sensors segment as we add headcount and additional resources to develop new products and services to further advance our scalable cloud-connected device platform. We believe that these investments will result in an increase in our subscription revenue base, which over time will result in revenue increasing faster than the increase in SG&A expenses as we reach economies of scale.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net was $7.9 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we earned interest income of $5.1 million, other income, net of $0.6 million, had losses from foreign currency transaction adjustments of $0.2 million, and interest expense of $0.1 million. Additionally, we recorded a net gain of $2.1 million related to an observable price change for our investment in Flock Group, Inc. and related warrants.\nThe decrease in interest income was a result of decreased interest rates during the current period, partially offset by higher balances of cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we earned interest income of $8.7 million and had losses from foreign currency transaction adjustments of $0.3 million, other income, net of $0.1 million, and interest expense of less than $0.1 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was a benefit of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective income tax rate for 2020 was 72.6%. The benefits related to excess stock-based compensation of $9.0 million, research and development credits of $10.2 million, and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”) of $0.9 million were partially offset by the tax effects of permanently non-deductible expenses for executive compensation of $15.5 million, an increase in uncertain tax benefits of $1.0 million, other permanently non-deductible expenses of $0.8 million and state tax expense of $0.9 million. Additionally, we recorded a $0.2 million increase to our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020 related to research and development tax credits that may not be utilized prior to expiration, partially offset by changes in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective income tax rate for 2019 was 57.4%. The benefits related to excess stock-based compensation of $5.0 million and research and development credits of $4.9 million were partially offset by the tax effects of permanently non-deductible expenses for executive compensation of $7.6 million, an increase in uncertain tax benefits of $1.2 million and other permanently non-deductible expenses of $1.1 million and state tax expense of $0.5 million. Additionally, we recorded\n35\na $0.4 million increase to our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019 related to research and development tax credits that may not be utilized prior to expiration, partially offset by changes in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nNet Income\nWe recorded net loss of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net income of $0.9 million in 2019. Net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.03 for 2020, compared to net income per basic and diluted share of $0.01 for 2019.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to September 30, 2020\nNet sales by product line were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nNet unit sales were as follows:\n​\n​\nNet sales for the TASER segment increased $51.4 million, or 60.8%, on a sequential basis primarily due to a $37.2 million increase in revenue from TASER 7 devices and a $12.1 million increase in cartridge revenue. The\n36\nincrease in TASER 7 revenues was a result of both increased unit sales and a higher average selling price, driven by greater adoption of TASER 7, especially internationally.\nNet sales for the Software and Sensors segment increased $8.3 million, or 10.2%, on a sequential basis primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in Axon Evidence and cloud services revenue and a $2.8 million increase in Axon Fleet revenue. The increase in Axon Evidence and cloud services revenue was a result of the increase in the aggregate number of users on our network. Axon Fleet revenue was driven primarily by increased unit sales, as well as an increase in the average selling price.\nInternational sales were $59.5 million in for the three months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $36.4 million, primarily driven by increased sales in Europe.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (CEO Performance Award). Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented below.\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing our operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\n37\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (CEO Performance Award) reconcile to net income as follows (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $155.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $16.8 million from December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $652.6 million, an increase of $256.4 million from December 31, 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):\n​\n​\nOperating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2020 of $38.5 million consisted of $1.7 million in net loss, the net add-back of non-cash income statement items totaling $141.0 million and a $100.8 million net change in operating assets and liabilities. Included in the non-cash items were $12.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $133.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, and a $16.5 million increase in deferred income tax assets. The most significant increase to the portion of cash provided by operating activities related to the changes in operating assets and liabilities was a $107.8 million increase in accounts and notes receivable and contract assets. The increase in accounts and notes receivable and contract assets was attributable to increased sales in 2020, primarily sales made under subscription plans. Operating cash flows were also negatively impacted by increased inventory of $52.2 million,\nas we proactively built up a safety stock of inventory to help meet strong product demand while also preparing us to stagger factory work schedules,\nand increased prepaid expenses and other assets of $14.9 million resulting primarily from an increase in deferred commissions expense. Operating cash flows were positively impacted by an increase in deferred revenue of $65.1 million.\nThe increase in deferred revenue was primarily attributable to increased prepayments for Software and Sensors hardware and services, and a smaller increase in hardware deferred revenue from TASER subscription sales.\n38\nInvesting activities\nWe used $356.5 million for investing activities in 2020. Purchases of investments, net of calls and maturities, were $276.7 million. We also invested $72.6 million in the purchase of property and equipment and intangibles, including $54.1 million for land on which we intend to construct our new manufacturing and office facility,\nand $7.1 million for equity investments in unconsolidated affiliates.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used provided by financing activities was $299.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, we completed an equity offering that generated net proceeds of $306.8 million.\nCertain RSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2020 were net-share settled, such that we withheld shares to cover the employees’ tax obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash, which totaled $7.8 million, to the appropriate taxing authorities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur most significant source of liquidity continues to be funds generated by operating activities and available cash and cash equivalents. In addition, our $50.0 million revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. Under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit. Advances under the line of credit bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.0 to 1.5% per year determined in accordance with a pricing grid based on our funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had letters of credit outstanding of $6.1 million, leaving the net amount available for borrowing of $43.9 million. The facility matures on December 31, 2021 and has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total line of credit up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the availability of additional bank commitments. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no borrowings under the line.\nOur agreement with the bank requires us to comply with a maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio, as defined, of no greater than 2.50 to 1.00 based upon a trailing four fiscal quarter period. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s funded debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.0000 to 1.00.\nOn January 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement which extends the maturity date to December 31, 2023 and increases the amount of the unsecured revolving line of credit which is available for letters of credit from $10 million to $20 million.\nTASER subscription and installment purchase arrangements typically involve amounts invoiced in five equal installments at the beginning of each year of the five-year term. This is in contrast to a traditional CED sale in which the entire amount being charged for the hardware is invoiced upon shipment. This impacts liquidity in a commensurate fashion, with the cash for the subscription or installment purchase received in five annual installments rather than up front. It is our strategic intent to shift an increasing amount of our business to a subscription model, to better match the municipal budgeting process of our customers as well as to allow for multiple product offerings to be bundled into existing subscriptions. We carefully considered the cash flow impacts of this strategic shift and regularly revisit our cash flow forecast with the goal of maintaining a comfortable level of liquidity as we introduce commercial offerings in which we incur upfront cash costs to produce and fulfill hardware sales ahead of the cash inflows from our customers.\nBased on our strong balance sheet and the fact that we had no long-term debt or financing lease obligations at December 31, 2020, we believe financing will be available, both through our existing credit line and possible\n39\nadditional financing. However, there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions or strategic investments and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We and our Board of Directors may consider repurchases of our common stock. Further repurchases of our common stock would take place on the open market, would be financed with available cash and are subject to authorization as well as market and business conditions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table outlines our future contractual financial obligations by period in which payment is expected, as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\nPurchase obligations in the table above represent $169.3 million of open purchase orders and $40.0 million of other purchase obligations. The open purchase orders represent both cancelable and non-cancelable purchase orders with key vendors, which are included in this table due to our strategic relationships with these vendors.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income taxes imposed by state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2020, we had $7.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. The settlement period for these long-term income tax liabilities cannot be determined; however, the liabilities are expected to increase by approximately $0.1 million within the next 12 months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated by reference herein.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe have identified the following accounting estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe that a change in these estimates is reasonably likely, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates. The effect of these estimates on our business operations is discussed below.\nProduct Warranties\nWe warranty our CEDs, Axon cameras and certain related accessories from manufacturing defects on a limited basis for a period of one year after purchase and, thereafter, will replace any defective unit for a fee. Estimated costs for the standard warranty are charged to cost of products sold when revenue is recorded for the related product. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical data related to warranty claims on a quarterly basis and this rate is applied to current product sales. Historically, reserve amounts have been increased if management becomes aware of a component failure or other issue that could result in larger than anticipated warranty claims from customers. The warranty reserve is reviewed quarterly to verify that it sufficiently reflects the remaining warranty obligations based\n40\non the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the warranty obligation period, and adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our warranty reserve was approximately $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Warranty expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.0 million, $1.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Warranty expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, was impacted by lower than expected warranty claims for the Axon Body 3 on-officer body camera. Warranty expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was impacted by higher than initially expected warranty claims for the Axon Flex 2 on-officer body camera. Warranty expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, was impacted by lower than expected warranty claims for the Axon Body 2 on-officer body camera.\nRevenue related to separately-priced extended warranties is initially recorded as deferred revenue at its allocated amount and subsequently recognized as net sales on a straight-line basis over the warranty service period. Costs related to extended warranties are charged to cost of product and service sales when incurred.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost of raw materials, which approximates the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and includes allocations of manufacturing labor and overhead. Provisions are made to reduce potentially excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories, as well as trial and evaluation inventories to their net realizable value. These provisions are based on management’s best estimate after considering historical demand, projected future demand, inventory purchase commitments, industry and market trends and conditions among other factors. We evaluate inventory costs for abnormal costs due to excess production capacity and treat such costs as period costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded provisions to reduce inventories to their lower of cost and net realizable value of approximately $3.8 million compared to $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The largest driver of the increase in the provision in 2020 compared to 2019 was a $2.2 million reduction in the carrying amount of our trial and evaluation inventory to zero which is our estimate of its net realizable value. The provision in 2020 and in 2019 was driven by analyses of projected sales data for existing products resulting in adjustments to state inventories at their lower of cost and net realizable value.\nRevenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue and Accounts and Notes Receivable\nWe derive revenue from two primary sources:  (1) the sale of physical products, including CEDs, Axon cameras, Axon Signal enabled devices, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as Axon docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (2) subscriptions to our Axon Evidence digital evidence management SaaS (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. To a lesser extent, we also recognize training, professional services and revenue related to other software and SaaS services. We apply the five-step model outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"Topic 606\").\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in Topic 606. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nRevenues are recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which is generally distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns.\nPerformance obligations to deliver products, including CEDs, cameras and related accessories such as cartridges, batteries and docks, are generally satisfied at the point in time we ship the product, as this is when the customer obtains control of the asset under our standard terms and conditions. In certain contracts with non-standard terms and\n41\nconditions, these performance obligations may not be satisfied until formal customer acceptance occurs. Performance obligations to fulfill service-type extended warranties and provide our SaaS offerings, including Axon Evidence and other cloud services, are generally satisfied over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of these services over the stated service period.\nMany of our products and services are sold on a standalone basis. We also bundle our hardware products and services together and sell them to our customers in single transactions, where the customer can make payments over a multi-year period. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the composition of revenue recognized from contracts containing multiple performance obligations and those not containing multiple performance obligations was as follows (dollars in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAdditionally, we offer customers the ability to purchase CED cartridges and certain services on an unlimited basis over the contractual term. Due to the unlimited nature of these arrangements whereby we are obligated to deliver unlimited products at the customer’s request, we account for these arrangements as stand-ready obligations, and recognize revenue ratably over the contract period. Cost of product sales is recognized as the products are shipped to the customer.\nWe have elected to recognize shipping costs as an expense in cost of product sales when the control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.\nSales tax collected on sales is netted against government remittances and thus, recorded on a net basis.\nDeferred revenue consists of payments received in advance related to products and services for which the criteria for revenue recognition have not yet been met. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent twelve month period from the balance sheet date is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term. Generally, customers are billed in annual installments.\nSales are typically made on credit, and we generally do not require collateral.\n42\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nWe do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; rather, such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year. Finite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Management evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets, including intangible assets with indefinite lives, may not be recoverable.\nCircumstances that might indicate long-lived assets might not be recoverable could include, but are not limited to, a change in the product mix, a change in the way products and services are created, produced or delivered, or a significant change in the way our products are branded and marketed. When performing a review for recoverability, management estimates the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss, if impairment exists, is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair value computed using discounted cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we abandoned certain planning and site development activities related to our planned new headquarters, resulting in an impairment charge of $0.7 million. Additionally, we recognized impairment charges totaling $0.5 million related to improvements and remodeling of certain of our offices. Both charges were included in sales, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we abandoned certain capitalized software related to implementation work on an enterprise resource planning system conversion, resulting in an impairment charge of $1.3 million, and certain planning and site development activities related to our planned new headquarters, resulting in an impairment charge of $0.7 million, both of which were included in sales, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During the year ended December 31, 2018, we abandoned certain developed technology acquired in a business combination resulting in an impairment charge of $2.0 million.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We must also assess whether uncertain tax positions as filed could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties if any. We have completed research and development tax credit studies for each year a tax credit was claimed for federal, Arizona, and California income tax purposes. We determined that it was more likely than not that the full benefit of the research and development tax credit would not be sustained on examination and accordingly, have established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.7 million as of December 31, 2020. We expect the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to increase by approximately $0.1 million within the next 12 months. Should the unrecognized tax benefit of $7.7 million be recognized, our effective tax rate would be favorably impacted. Our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state, and local governments, generally years after the returns are filed. These returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws. During 2020, we completed an audit of our 2016 U.S. federal income tax return by the Internal Revenue Service and began an audit of our 2016 and 2017 California income tax returns for which we are currently in the closing phase with the Franchise Tax Board. Additionally, we have been notified that an audit will commence for Axon Public Safety Southeast Asia LLC, our entity in Vietnam. The tax period has not yet been defined.\n43\nOur calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the U.S. and internationally, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, or if the recorded tax liability is greater than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit, or additional income tax expense, respectively, in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. A valuation allowance is established if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business.\nWe anticipate sufficient future pre-tax book income to realize a large portion of our deferred tax assets. However, based on expected income for years in which Arizona R&D tax credits are set to expire, and certain identified intangibles with an indefinite life, a reserve of $7.3 million has been recorded as a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have historically granted stock-based compensation to key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. Stock-based compensation awards primarily consist of service-based RSUs, performance-based RSUs, and performance-based stock options. Our stock-based compensation awards are classified as equity and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. For service-based awards, we recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. Vesting of performance-based RSUs is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to our operating performance, as well as successful and timely development and market acceptance of future product introductions. For performance-based RSUs containing only performance conditions, compensation cost is recognized using the graded attribution model over the explicit or implicit service period. For awards containing multiple service, performance or market conditions, where all conditions must be satisfied prior to vesting, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period, based on management’s estimate of the probability and timing of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. For both service-based and performance-based RSUs, we account for forfeitures as they occur as a reduction to stock-based compensation expense and additional paid-in-capital.\nFor performance-based options, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance goals when the achievement of each individual performance goal becomes probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. Refer to Note 13 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have granted a total of approximately 15.0 million performance-based awards (options and restricted stock units) of which approximately 12.0 million are outstanding as of December 31, 2020, the vesting of which is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria including the successful development and market acceptance of future product introductions as well as our future sales targets and operating performance and market capitalization. Compensation expense for performance awards will be recognized based on management’s best\n44\nestimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied using the most currently available projections of future product adoption and operating performance, adjusted at each balance sheet date. Changes in the subjective and probability-based assumptions can materially affect the estimates of the fair value of the awards and timing of recognition of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nContingencies and Accrued Litigation Expense\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including product-related and other litigation. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReserve for Expected Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to the risk of credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. Our expected credit loss allowance for accounts receivable, notes receivable, and contract assets represents management’s best estimate and application of judgment considering a number of factors, including historical collection experience, published or estimated credit default rates for entities that represent our customer base, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. Additionally, specific reserve amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. Our monitoring activities include account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.\n​\nWe review receivables for U.S. and international customers separately to better reflect different published credit default rates and economic and market conditions.\nA majority of our customers are governmental agencies. Due to municipal government funding rules, certain of our contracts are subject to appropriation, termination for convenience, or similar cancellation clauses, which could allow our customers to cancel or not exercise options to renew contracts in the future. Economic slowdowns that negatively affect municipal tax collections and put pressure on law enforcement may increase this risk and negatively impact the realizability of our accounts and notes receivable and contract assets. We considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased our reserve for expected credit losses by approximately $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBased on the balances of our financial instruments as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 25 percent increase in expected credit loss rates across all pools would result in a $0.7 million increase in the allowance for expected credit losses.\n​"

    "text": "Interest Rate Risk\nWe typically invest in a limited number of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in money market accounts, certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds with a typical long-term debt rating of “A” or better by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, denominated in U.S. dollars. All of our cash equivalents and investments are treated as “held-to-maturity.” Investments in fixed-rate interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk as their market value may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. As a result, we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in\n45\ninterest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as “held-to-maturity” based on our intent and ability to hold these instruments to maturity, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates. These securities are reported at amortized cost. Based on investment positions as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $1.7 million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAdditionally, we have access to a $50.0 million line of credit borrowing facility which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0 to 1.5% per year determined in accordance with a pricing grid based on our funded debt to EBITDA ratio. Under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit, which totaled $6.1 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, there was no amount outstanding under the line of credit, and the available borrowing under the line of credit was $43.9 million. We have not borrowed any funds under the line of credit since its inception; however; should we need to do so in the future, such borrowings could be subject to adverse or favorable changes in the underlying interest rate.\nExchange Rate Risk\nOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in each case compared to the U.S. dollar, related to transactions by our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our sales to international customers are transacted in foreign currencies and therefore are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions. The cost of our products to our customers increases when the U.S. dollar strengthens against their local currency, and we may have more sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies in future years which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk. Additionally, intercompany sales to our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international subsidiaries are transacted in U.S. dollars which could increase our foreign exchange rate risk caused by foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nTo date, we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities. However, we may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. As such, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.\n​\n46"

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (“Axon”, the “Company”, \"we\", or \"us\") is a market-leading provider of law enforcement technology solutions. Our core mission is to protect life. We fulfill that mission through developing hardware and software products that advance the long term objectives of a) obsoleting the bullet, b) reducing social conflict, and c) enabling a fair and effective justice system.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Axon Enterprise, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated.\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include:\n​\nActual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents and investments include cash, money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, state and municipal obligations, U.S. Treasury inflation protected securities, U.S. Treasury Repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury bills, and agency bonds. We place our cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Although we deposit our cash with multiple financial institutions, our deposits regularly exceed federally insured limits.\nCash and cash equivalents include funds on hand and highly liquid investments purchased with initial maturity of three months or less. Short-term investments include securities with an expected maturity date within one year of the balance sheet date that do not meet the definition of a cash equivalent, and long-term investments are securities with an expected maturity date greater than one year. Based on management’s intent and ability to hold our investments, they are classified as held to maturity investments and are recorded at amortized cost. Held-to-maturity investments are reviewed quarterly for impairment to determine if other-than-temporary declines in the fair value have occurred for any individual investment that may affect our intent and ability to hold the investment until recovery. Other-than-temporary declines in the value of held-to-maturity investments are recorded as expense in the period the determination is made.\n52\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash balances of $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily relate to funds held in an international bank account for a country in which we are required to maintain a minimum balance to operate. Approximately half of the balance was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder included in other assets.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost of raw materials, which approximates the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and includes allocations of manufacturing labor and overhead. Provisions are made to reduce potentially excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories, as well as trial and evaluation inventories to their net realizable value. These provisions are based on management’s best estimate after considering historical demand, projected future demand, inventory purchase commitments, industry and market trends and conditions among other factors. We evaluate inventory costs for abnormal costs due to excess production capacity and treat such costs as period costs.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while ordinary maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products and services to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility is reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products are not material.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs and applications. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the intended function. Additionally, we capitalize qualifying costs incurred for upgrades and enhancements to existing software that result in additional functionality. Costs related to preliminary project planning activities, post-implementation activities, maintenance and minor modifications are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nValuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives; rather, such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year. Management evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets and\n53\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nintangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets, including intangible assets with indefinite lives, may not be recoverable.\nCircumstances that might indicate long-lived assets might not be recoverable could include, but are not limited to, a change in the product mix, a change in the way products and services are created, produced or delivered, or a significant change in the way our products are branded and marketed. When performing a review for recoverability, management estimates the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss, if impairment exists, is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair value computed using discounted cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we abandoned certain planning and site development activities related to our planned new headquarters, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n0.7\nmillion. Additionally, we recognized impairment charges totaling $\n0.5\nmillion related to improvements and remodeling of certain of our offices. Both charges were included in sales, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we abandoned certain capitalized software related to implementation work on an enterprise resource planning system conversion, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n1.3\nmillion, and certain planning and site development activities related to our planned new headquarters, resulting in an impairment charge of $\n0.7\nmillion, both of which were included in sales, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we abandoned certain developed technology acquired in a business combination resulting in an impairment charge of $\n2.0\nmillion which was included in sales, general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nCustomer Deposits\nWe require deposits in advance of shipment for certain customer sales orders. Additionally, customers may elect to make deposits with us related to contracts for our products and services that were not executed as of the end of a reporting period. Customer deposits are included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue Recognition, Deferred Revenue and Accounts and Notes Receivable\nWe derive revenue from\ntwo\nprimary sources:  (1) the sale of physical products, including conducted energy devices (\"CEDs\"), Axon cameras, Axon Signal enabled devices, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories such as Axon docks, cartridges and batteries, among others, and (2) subscriptions to our Axon Evidence digital evidence management software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") (including data storage fees and other ancillary services), which includes varying levels of support. To a lesser extent, we also recognize revenue from training, professional services and other software and SaaS services. We apply the five-step model outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts from Customers (\"Topic 606\"). For additional discussion of the adoption of Topic 606, see Note 2.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in Topic 606. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our estimate of the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nRevenues are recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which is generally distinct and accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns.\nPerformance obligations to deliver products, including CEDs, cameras and related accessories such as cartridges, batteries and docks, are generally satisfied at the point in time we ship the product, as this is when the customer obtains control of the asset under our standard terms and conditions. In certain contracts with non-standard terms and conditions,\n54\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nthese performance obligations may not be satisfied until formal customer acceptance occurs. Performance obligations to fulfill service-type extended warranties and provide our SaaS offerings, including Axon Evidence and other cloud services, are generally satisfied over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of these services over the stated service period.\nMany of our products and services are sold on a standalone basis. We also bundle our hardware products and services together and sell them to our customers in single transactions, where the customer can make payments over a multi-year period. These sales may include payments for upfront hardware and services, as well as payments for hardware and services to be provided by us at a future date. Additionally, we offer customers the ability to purchase CED cartridges and certain services on an unlimited basis over the contractual term. Due to the unlimited nature of these arrangements whereby we are obligated to deliver unlimited products at the customer’s request, we account for these arrangements as stand-ready obligations, and recognize revenue ratably over the contract period. Cost of product sales is recognized when control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.\nWe have elected to recognize shipping costs as an expense in cost of product sales when the control of hardware products or accessories have transferred to the customer.\nSales tax collected on sales is netted against government remittances and thus, recorded on a net basis.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We generally have an unconditional right to consideration when we invoice our customers and record a receivable. We record a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue) when revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing. Contract asset amounts that will be invoiced during the subsequent twelve month period from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets and the remaining portion is recorded within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent twelve month period from the balance sheet date is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term deferred revenue. Generally, customers are billed in annual installments. See Note 2 for further disclosures about our contract assets.\nSales are typically made on credit, and we generally do not require collateral. We are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. Our expected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable, notes receivable, and contract assets is developed using historical collection experience, published or estimated credit default rates for entities that represent our customer base, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of customers' trade accounts receivables. We review receivables for U.S. and international customers separately to better reflect different published credit default rates and economic and market conditions. Additionally, specific reserve amounts are established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. Our monitoring activities include account reconciliation, dispute resolution, payment confirmation, consideration of customers' financial condition and macroeconomic conditions. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Accounts and notes receivable and contract assets are presented net of a reserve for expected credit losses, which totaled $\n3.4\nmillion and $\n1.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and January 1, 2020, respectively. This reserve represents management’s best estimate and application of judgment considering a number of factors, including those listed above. In the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from our estimates, additional expense could be necessary.\n​\nWe considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and increased our reserve for expected credit losses by approximately $\n0.9\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n​\nCost of Product and Service Sales\nCost of product sales represents manufacturing costs, consisting of materials, labor and overhead related to finished goods and components. Shipping costs incurred related to product delivery are also included in cost of products sold. Cost\n55\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nof service sales includes third-party cloud services, and software maintenance and support costs, including personnel costs, associated with supporting Evidence.com and other software related services.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. We incurred advertising costs of $\n1.3\nmillion, $\n0.9\nmillion and $\n1.1\nmillion in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Advertising costs are included in sales, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations.\nStandard Warranties\nWe warranty our CEDs, Axon cameras and certain related accessories from manufacturing defects on a limited basis for a period of\none year\nafter purchase and, thereafter, will replace any defective unit for a fee. Estimated costs for the standard warranty are charged to cost of products sold when revenue is recorded for the related product. Future warranty costs are estimated on a quarterly basis based on historical data related to warranty claims and this rate is applied to current product sales. Historically, reserve amounts have been increased if management becomes aware of a component failure or other issue that could result in larger than anticipated warranty claims from customers. The warranty reserve is reviewed quarterly to verify that it sufficiently reflects the remaining warranty obligations based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the warranty obligation period, and adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. The warranty reserve is included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nChanges in our estimated warranty reserve were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense as incurred research and development costs that do not meet the qualifications to be capitalized. We incurred research and development expense of $\n123.2\nmillion, $\n100.7\nmillion and $\n76.9\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has\n56\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\na greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. We also assess whether uncertain tax positions, as filed, could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Refer to Note 11 for additional information regarding the change in unrecognized tax benefits.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers / Suppliers\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts and notes receivable, contract assets, and cash. Historically, we have experienced an immaterial level of write-offs related to uncollectible accounts.\nWe maintain the majority of our cash at\nfour\ndepository institutions. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate balances in such accounts were $\n145.1\nmillion. Our balances with these institutions regularly exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured limits for domestic deposits and various deposit insurance programs covering our deposits in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. To manage the related credit exposure, management continually monitors the creditworthiness of the financial institutions where we have deposits.\nNo\ncustomer represented more than 10% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. At December 31, 2020, and 2019,\nno\ncustomer represented more than 10% of the aggregate balance of accounts and notes receivable and contract assets.\nWe currently purchase both off the shelf and custom components, including, but not limited to, finished circuit boards, injection-molded plastic components, small machined parts, custom cartridge components, electronic components, and off the shelf sub-assemblies from suppliers located in the U.S., Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan. Although we currently obtain many of these components from single source suppliers, we own the injection molded component tooling, most of the designs, and the test fixtures used in their production for all custom components. As a result, we believe we could obtain alternative suppliers in most cases without incurring significant production delays. We also strategically hold safety stock levels on custom components to further reduce this risk. For off the shelf components, we believe that in most cases there are readily available alternative suppliers who can consistently meet our needs for these components. We acquire components either through contractual agreements or on a purchase order basis along with in some cases providing rolling 12 month forecasts to suppliers so they can procure or secure subcomponents to further mitigate upstream risks to our supply chain.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe use the fair value framework that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques for measuring financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis and for non-financial assets and liabilities when these items are re-measured. Fair value is considered to be the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants, to sell an asset or transfer a liability at the measurement date. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n57\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nWe have cash equivalents and investments, which at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were comprised of money market funds, agency bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, and U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities. See additional disclosure regarding the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments in Note 3. Included in the balance of other assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n4.7\nmillion and $\n4.2\nmillion, respectively, related to corporate-owned life insurance policies which are used to fund our deferred compensation plan. We determine the fair value of our insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer, a Level 2 valuation technique.\nDuring 2020, we invested in two unconsolidated affiliates, which are included within other assets. The estimated fair value of the investments was determined based on Level 3 inputs. As of December 31, 2020, management estimated that the fair value of the investments equaled the carrying value.\nOur financial instruments also include accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, their fair values approximate their carrying values on the balance sheet.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nOur operations are comprised of\ntwo\nreportable segments: the manufacture and sale of CEDs, batteries, accessories, extended warranties and other products and services (the “TASER” segment); and the development, manufacture and sale of software and sensors, which includes the sale of devices, wearables, applications, cloud and mobile products, and services (collectively, the \"Software and Sensors\" segment). Reportable segments are determined based on discrete financial information reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer who is our chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). We organize and review operations based on products and services, and currently there are no operating segments that are aggregated. We perform an analysis of our reportable segments at least annually. Additional information related to our business segments is summarized in Note 17.\nFor a summary of net sales by geographic area, see Note 2.\nThe majority of our sales to international customers are transacted in foreign currencies\nand are attributed to each country based on the shipping address of the distributor or customer. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nno\nindividual country outside the U.S. represented more than 10% of net sales. Substantially all of our assets are located in the U.S.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize expense related to stock-based compensation transactions in which we receive services in exchange for equity instruments of the Company. Stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") is measured based on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize stock-based compensation expense over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis for time-based RSUs. For performance-based RSUs, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period based on management’s estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. For performance-based options with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement. For both time-based and performance-based\n58\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nRSUs, we recognize forfeitures as they occur as a reduction to stock-based compensation expense and to additional paid-in-capital.\neXponential Stock Performance Plan\nOn February 12, 2019, our shareholders approved the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), which was adopted by the Board of Directors to reserve a sufficient number of shares to facilitate our eXponential Stock Performance Plan (“XSPP”) and grants of eXponential Stock Units (“XSUs”) under the plan. The XSUs are grants of restricted stock units, each with a term of approximately\nnine years\n, that vest in\n12\nequal tranches. Each of the\n12\ntranches will vest upon certification by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization goal for such tranche, which begins at $\n2.5\nbillion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $\n1.0\nbillion thereafter, and (ii) any one of\neight\noperational goals focused on revenue or\neight\noperational goals focused on Adjusted EBITDA (CEO Performance Award) have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. A total of approximately\n0.3\nmillion XSUs were granted during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock-based compensation expense associated with XSU awards is recognized over the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period for each pair of market capitalization and operational goals, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational goal is considered probable of being met. The market capitalization goal period and the valuation of each tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is also used as the basis for determining the expected achievement period of the market capitalization goal. The probability of meeting an operational goal and the expected achievement point in time for meeting a probable operational goal are based on a subjective assessment of our forward-looking financial projections, taking into consideration statistical analysis. Even though no tranches of the XSU awards vest unless a market capitalization and a matching operational goal are both achieved, stock-based compensation expense is recognized when an operational goal is considered probable of achievement regardless of whether a market capitalization goal is actually achieved.\nGiven the complexity of the awards, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to simulate a range of possible future market capitalizations for the Company over the term of the awards at each of the respective grant dates. The average of all iterations of the simulation was used as the basis for the valuation and market capitalization goal derived service period for each tranche. Additionally, we applied an illiquidity discount of between\n10.3\n% and\n17.4\n% to the valuation of XSUs because the awards specify a post-vest holding period of\n2.5\nyears for the acquired shares that vest. Certain of the XSU awards specify a post-vest holding period of the longer of\n2.5\nyears or until the next tranche vests. The illiquidity discounts were estimated using the Finnerty model and reduced by the impact of expected payroll and income taxes due upon vesting of the awards, as the related proportion of shares are expected to be sold to satisfy such obligations. We measured the grant date fair value of the XSU awards with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of between\n0.53\n% and\n1.53\n%, expected term of between\n7.3\nand\n8.0\nyears, expected volatility of between\n46.37\n% and\n51.96\n%, and dividend yield of\n0.00\n%.\nStock Options\nOn May 24, 2018 (the “CEO Grant Date”), our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of\n6,365,856\nstock option awards to Patrick W. Smith, our CEO (the “CEO Performance Award”). The CEO Performance Award consists of\n12\nvesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational goals (performance conditions) and market capitalization goals (market conditions), assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Stock-based compensation expense associated with the CEO Performance Award is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longer of the expected achievement period for each pair of market capitalization and operational goals, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational goal is considered probable of being met.\nGiven the complexity of the award, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to simulate a range of possible future market capitalizations for the Company over the term of the options at the grant date. The average of all iterations of the simulation\n59\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nwas used as the basis for the valuation and market capitalization goal derived service period for each tranche. Additionally, we applied an illiquidity discount of\n9.2\n% to the valuation because the award specifies a post-exercise holding period of\n2.5\nyears. This discount was estimated using the Finnerty model and reduced by the impact of expected payroll and income taxes due upon exercise of the options, as the related proportion of shares are expected to be sold to satisfy such obligations. Additional assumptions used for the CEO Performance Award and the resulting estimates of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted are as follows:\n​\n​\nThe expected life of the options represented the estimated period of time from grant date until exercise; in this case, exercise was assumed to occur at the full contractual term of\nten years\nfrom grant and was based on input from the CEO and his historical behavior of not exercising vested options until the end of their terms. Expected stock price volatility was based on the average of the\n9.76\n-year historical volatility and the implied volatility on 1,080-day call option for the Company. The risk-free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on United States Treasury bill zero-coupon issuances with an equivalent remaining term to the term of the options. We have not paid dividends in the past and do not plan to pay any dividends in the near future.\nNo\noptions were awarded during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Other than the CEO Performance Award,\nno\noptions were awarded during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome (Loss) per Common Share\nBasic income or loss per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted income (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution from outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock units. The calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding and earnings per share are as follows (in thousands except per share data):\n​\n​\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“Topic 326”): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 includes an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss model) on financial instruments\n60\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nand other commitments that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. The use of forecasted information is intended to incorporate more timely information in the estimate of expected credit losses. This ASU also requires enhanced disclosures relating to significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as credit quality. Upon adoption effective January 1, 2020, we recorded a noncash cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $\n0.6\nmillion, net of $\n0.2\nmillion of income taxes, on the opening consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2020,\nreflecting an overall increase to the allowance for expected credit losses\n.\nSee Notes 3 and 4 for further disclosures related to Topic 326.\n​\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amendments apply to the disclosures of changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and provide that the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. Adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2020 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n​\nEffective the first quarter of 2021:\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n​\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments – Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) – Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (a Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The guidance clarifies the interaction between ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and the ASU on equity method investments. ASU 2016-01 provides companies with an alternative to measure certain equity securities without a readily determinable fair value at cost, minus impairment, if any, unless an observable transaction for an identical or similar security occurs. ASU 2020-01 clarifies that for purposes of applying the Topic 321 measurement alternative, an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting under Topic 323, immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. In addition, the new ASU provides direction that a company should not consider whether the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or the fair value option when it is determining the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options, upon either settlement or exercise. The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments are to be applied prospectively. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n​\nReclassification of Prior Year Presentation\nCertain prior year amounts, including the long-term portion of contract assets, have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications are not material and had no effect on the reported results of operations.\n61\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nRisks and Uncertainties\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. As a result of COVID-19, we have modified certain aspects of our business, including restricting employee travel, allowing a remote work model for the majority of our office staff, and holding certain events and meetings online instead of in person, among other modifications. We are monitoring the situation closely, and although operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to date, the ultimate duration and severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment and business is uncertain. However, while we have not incurred significant disruptions from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration of the outbreak, actions that  may be taken by governmental authorities and the impact to our customers and partners. At this time, we are unable to estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations.\n2. Revenues\nNature of Products and Services\nThe following table presents our revenues by primary product and service offering (in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by geography (in thousands):\n​\n​\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We generally have an unconditional right to consideration when we invoice our customers and record a receivable. We record a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability (deferred revenue) when revenue will be recognized subsequent to invoicing.\n62\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nContract assets generally result from our subscription programs where we satisfy a hardware performance obligation upon shipment to the customer, and the right to the portion of the transaction price allocated to that hardware performance obligation is conditional on our future performance of a SaaS service obligation under the contract. We recognize a portion of the amount allocated to hardware products shipped to the customer as accounts receivable when invoiced to the customer, and record the remaining allocated value as a contract asset as we have generally fulfilled our hardware performance obligation upon shipment. Unbilled accounts receivable expected to be invoiced and collected within twelve months was $\n18.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, and was included in accounts and notes receivable, net on our consolidated balance sheet.\nContract liabilities generally consist of deferred revenue on our subscription programs where we generally invoice customers at the beginning of each annual contract period and record a receivable at the time of invoicing when there is an unconditional right to consideration.\nDeferred revenue is comprised mainly of unearned revenue related to our Axon Evidence SaaS platform, secure cloud-based storage, service-type extended warranties, stand-ready obligations in our cartridge programs, and rights to future CED, camera and related accessories hardware in our subscription programs. Revenue for Axon Evidence and cloud-based storage, our service-type extended warranties and stand-ready cartridge programs is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription term. Revenue for the rights to future hardware is generally recognized at the point in time the hardware products are shipped to the customer.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type and geography, but our standard terms are that payments are due within\n30\ndays from the date of invoice.\nThe following table presents our contract assets, contract liabilities and certain information related to these balances as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n​\n​\nContract liabilities (deferred revenue) consisted of the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\n63\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\n​\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $\n1.73\nbillion of remaining performance obligations, which included both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606 as of December 31, 2020. We expect to recognize between\n20\n% -\n25\n% of this balance over the next\ntwelve months\n, and expect the remainder to be recognized over the following\nfive\nto\nseven years\n, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, which consist primarily of sales commissions. These costs are ascribed to or allocated to the underlying performance obligations in the contract and amortized consistent with the recognition timing of the revenue for the underlying performance obligations.\nFor contract costs related to performance obligations with an amortization period of one year or less, we apply the practical expedient to expense these sales commissions when incurred. These costs are recognized as incurred within sales, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our assets for costs to obtain contracts were as follows (in thousands):\n​\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $\n11.3\nmillion and $\n8.2\nmillion, respectively, of amortization related to deferred commissions. These costs are recorded within sales, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with certain municipal government customers may be subject to budget appropriation, other contract cancellation clauses or future periods which are optional. In contracts where the customer’s performance is subject to budget appropriation clauses, we generally consider the likelihood of non-appropriation to be remote when determining the contract term and transaction price. Contracts with other cancellation provisions or optional periods may require judgment in determining the contract term, including the existence of material rights, determining transaction price and identifying the performance obligations.\n64\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nAt times, customers may request changes that either amend, replace or cancel existing contracts. Judgment is required to determine whether the specific facts and circumstances within the contracts require the changes to be accounted for as a separate contract or as a modification. Generally, contract modifications containing additional goods and services that are determined to be distinct and sold at their SSP are accounted for as a separate contract. For contract modifications where both criteria are not met, the original contract is updated and the required adjustments to revenue and contract assets, liabilities, and other accounts are made accordingly.\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately rather than together may require significant judgment. We consider CED devices and related accessories, as well as cameras and related accessories, to be separately identifiable from each other as well as from extended warranties on these products and the SaaS subscriptions to Axon Evidence and other cloud services.\nIn contracts where there are timing differences between when we transfer a promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, we have determined that, with the exception of our TASER 60 installment purchase arrangements, our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded revenue of $\n34.0\nmillion, including $\n1.5\nmillion of interest income, under our TASER 60 plan. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded revenue of $\n39.3\nmillion including $\n1.6\nmillion of interest income under our TASER 60 plan. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded revenue of $\n48.2\nmillion including $\n1.3\nmillion of interest income under our TASER 60 plan.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We analyze separate sales of our products and services as a basis for estimating the SSP of our products and services and then use that SSP as the basis for allocating the transaction price when our products and services are sold together in a contract with multiple performance obligations. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions, time value of money and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as geographic region and distribution channel in determining the SSP.\n65\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\n3. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and held-to-maturity investments at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n66\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\n​\nWe adopted Topic 326 on January 1, 2020, and applied the credit loss guidance related to held-to-maturity securities prospectively\n. Because we do not have any history of losses for our held-to-maturity investments, o\nur expected loss allowance methodology for held-to-maturity investments is developed using published or estimated credit default rates for similar investments and current and future economic and market conditions. At January 1 and December 31, 2020, our credit loss reserve for held-to-maturity investments was approximately\n$\n0.1\nmillion and\n$\n0.2\nmillion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased the frequency of review for our investment portfolio in order to more closely monitor potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy.\n​\n4. Expected Credit Losses\nThe following table provides a roll-forward of the allowance for expected credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of accounts receivable, notes receivable, and contract assets to present the net amount expected to be collected (in thousands):\n​\n​\n67\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nAs of December 31, 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses for each type of customer receivable was as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n5. Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost of raw materials which approximates the FIFO method and includes allocations of manufacturing labor and overhead. Provisions are made to reduce excess, obsolete or slow-moving inventories to their net realizable value. Inventories consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n6. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\nIn September 2020, we purchased a parcel of land located in Scottsdale, Arizona at auction from the Arizona State Land Department, on which we intend to construct our new manufacturing and office facility. The purchase price of the land was\n$\n49.1\nmillion, plus selling fees, administrative fees, and certain other costs and expenses incurred by the Arizona State Land Department pursuant to the auction, for a total cost of approximately\n$\n50.6\nmillion. We also capitalized legal and broker fees related to the purchase totaling approximately\n$\n1.3\nmillion. Additionally, we capitalized approximately\n$\n2.2\nmillion paid to the City of Scottsdale under a separate public infrastructure reimbursement development agreement; we are eligible for a refund of this and other infrastructure and development costs to be paid by Axon up to a total of approximately\n$\n9.4\nmillion if certain milestones in the agreement are achieved.\n68\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was $\n9.2\nmillion, $\n7.9\nmillion and $\n4.9\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of which $\n4.0\nmillion, $\n3.5\nmillion and $\n1.4\nmillion was included in cost of sales for the respective years.\n7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nIntangible assets (other than goodwill) consisted of the following (in thousands):\n​\n​\nAmortization expense of intangible assets was $\n3.3\nmillion, $\n3.5\nmillion and $\n5.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Other Long-Term Assets\nOther long-term assets consisted of the following at December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\nIn October 2020, we made an additional $\n2.1\nmillion investment in Flock Group Inc. The issuance of new equity by Flock Group Inc. to us and other investors represented an observable price change for our initial investment and related warrants. Accordingly, we recorded an increase of $\n2.4\nmillion to our carrying value during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.\nIn February 2021, we made a $\n20.0\nmillion minority investment in RapidSOS, Inc.\n9.

Commitments and Contingencies\nData Storage Purchase Commitment\nIn June 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement for cloud data storage with a\n3 year\nterm beginning July 1, 2019. The purchase agreement includes a total commitment of $\n50.0\nmillion, with an up-front prepayment of $\n15.0\nmillion that was made in July 2019. Storage fees under this agreement were $\n20.6\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, and were recorded in cost of service sales. The remaining purchase commitment at December 31, 2020 was $\n22.4\nmillion.\nPurchase commitments\nWe routinely enter into cancelable and non-cancelable purchase orders with many of our key vendors. Based on the strategic relationships with many of these vendors, our ability to cancel these purchase orders and maintain a favorable relationship would be limited. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $\n169.3\nmillion of open purchase orders.\nLitigation\nProduct Litigation\nAs a manufacturer of weapons and other law enforcement tools used in high-risk field environments, we are often the subject of products liability litigation concerning the use of our products. We are currently named as a defendant in\nseven\nlawsuits (\n1\npending dismissal) in which the plaintiffs allege either wrongful death or personal injury in situations in which a TASER CED was used by law enforcement officers in connection with arrests or training. While the facts vary from case to case, these product liability claims typically allege defective product design, manufacturing, and/or failure to warn. They seek compensatory and sometimes punitive damages, often in unspecified amounts.\nWe continue to aggressively defend all product litigation. As a general rule, it is our policy not to settle suspect injury or death cases. Exceptions are sometimes made where the settlement is strategically beneficial to us. Due to the confidential nature of our litigation strategy and the confidentiality agreements that are executed in the event of a settlement, we do not identify or comment on specific settlements by case or amount. Based on current information, we do not believe that the outcome of any such legal proceeding will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We are self-insured for the first $\n5.0\nmillion of any product claim made after 2014. No judgment or settlement has ever exceeded this amount in any products case. We continue to maintain product liability insurance coverage, including an insurance policy fronting arrangement, above our self-insured retention with various limits depending on the policy period.\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission Litigation\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) filed an enforcement action on January 3, 2020 regarding Axon’s May 2018 acquisition of Vievu LLC from Safariland LLC. The FTC alleges the merger was anticompetitive and adversely affected the body worn camera (“BWC”) and digital evidence management systems (“DEMS”) market for “large metropolitan police departments.” Fact and expert discovery is complete.  On October 2, 2020, the Ninth Circuit stayed the administrative hearing set for October 13, 2020 pending decision on Axon’s appeal (see below). If ultimately successful, the FTC may require Axon to divest Vievu and other assets or take other remedial measures, any of which could be material to Axon. We are vigorously defending the matter. At this time, we cannot predict the eventual scope, duration, or outcome of the proceeding and accordingly we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nPrior to the FTC’s enforcement action, Axon sued the FTC in federal court in the District of Arizona for declaratory and injunctive relief alleging the FTC’s structure and administrative processes violate Article II of the U.S. Constitution and our Fifth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection. On April 8, 2020, the district court dismissed the\n71\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\naction, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction, requiring Axon to first bring its constitutional claims in the administrative case. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that ruling on January 28, 2021 (No. 20-15662) in a split 2-1 decision. We are exploring further appellate options, including a petition for rehearing en banc to the Ninth Circuit and a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. The administrative case should remain stayed until the appellate mandate issues.\nIn parallel to these matters, we are evaluating strategic alternatives to litigation, which we might pursue if determined to be in the best interests of shareholders and customers. This could include a divestiture of the Vievu entity and/or related assets and the licensure of certain intellectual and other intangible property. While we continue to believe the acquisition of Vievu was lawful and a benefit to Vievu’s customers, the cost, risk and distraction of protracted litigation merit consideration of settlement if achievable on terms agreeable to the FTC and the company.\nGeneral\nFrom time to time, we are notified that we may be a party to a lawsuit or that a claim is being made against us. It is our policy to not disclose the specifics of any claim or threatened lawsuit until the summons and complaint are actually served on us. After carefully assessing the claim, and assuming we determine that we are not at fault or we disagree with the damages or relief demanded, we vigorously defend any lawsuit filed against us. We record a liability when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. When losses are deemed reasonably possible but not probable, we determine whether it is possible to provide an estimate of the amount of the loss or range of possible losses for the claim, if material for disclosure. In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood of our prevailing, the availability of insurance, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update accruals as matters progress over time.\nBased on our assessment of outstanding litigation and claims as of  December 31, 2020, we have determined that it is not reasonably possible that these lawsuits will individually, or in the aggregate, materially affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the outcome of any litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that any expense, liability or damages that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will be covered by our insurance or will not be in excess of amounts recognized or provided by insurance coverage and will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nUnder certain circumstances, we use letters of credit and surety bonds to guarantee our performance under various contracts, principally in connection with the installation and integration of our Axon cameras and related technologies. Certain of our letters of credit contracts and surety bonds have stated expiration dates, with others being released as the contractual performance terms are completed. We expect to fulfill all contractual performance obligations related to outstanding guarantees. At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $\n6.1\nmillion, which are expected to expire in June and September 2021.\nWe also had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of\n$\n2.0\nmillion that do not draw against our credit facility. The outstanding letters of credit are expected to expire in June 2021. In January 2021, the letters of credit were amended to expire in January 2022.\nAdditionally, we had approximately $\n21.5\nmillion of outstanding surety bonds at December 31, 2020, with $\n0.4\nmillion expiring in 2021, $\n3.1\nmillion expiring in 2022, $\n7.5\nmillion expiring in 2023, and the remaining $\n10.5\nmillion expiring in 2024.\n72\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\n11. Income Taxes\nIncome (loss) before income taxes included the following components for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\nSignificant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\nA reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the federal statutory rate follows for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n73\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\n​\nSignificant components of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows at December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\nWe have $\n0.5\nmillion of state net operating losses (“NOLs”) which expire at various dates between 2029 and 2036. We also have a federal NOL of $\n0.1\nmillion which expires in 2036, and is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. We have $\n0.1\nmillion of federal R&D credits, which expire between 2034 and 2037, and are also subject to limitation under IRC Section 382. We have $\n11.6\nmillion of Arizona R&D credits carrying forward, which expire at various dates between 2021 and 2035. In the U.K., Canada, and Australia, we have $\n6.0\nmillion, $\n1.0\nmillion, and $\n1.3\nmillion of NOLs, respectively, which expire at various dates or may be carried forward indefinitely.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have assessed the likelihood that deferred income tax assets will be realized from future taxable income. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred income tax assets, we consider all available evidence, positive and negative, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred income tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we continue to demonstrate cumulative positive income in the U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions; however, we have Arizona R&D tax credits expiring unutilized each year. Therefore, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that our Arizona R&D deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we now have cumulative pre-tax income in the U.K. and Canada, along with positive evidence from projections of future growth for both entities. Therefore, we have released the full valuation allowances of $\n1.3\nmillion and $\n0.3\nmillion, respectively.\n74\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nIn Australia, we have determined that sufficient deferred tax liabilities will reverse in order to realize all assets except one long-lived intangible where there is not an expectation that the asset will be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a partial valuation allowance for Australia.\nWe consider the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. We project that our foreign earnings will be utilized offshore for working capital and future foreign growth. The determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those undistributed earnings is not practicable due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local country tax laws. If we decide to repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings, we will need to recognize the income tax effects in the period we change our assertion on indefinite reinvestment.\nWe complete R&D tax credit studies for each year that an R&D tax credit is claimed for federal, Arizona, and California income tax purposes. Management has made the determination that it is more likely than not that the full benefit of the R&D tax credit will not be sustained on examination and recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $\n7.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. Should the unrecognized tax benefit of $\n7.7\nmillion be recognized, our effective tax rate would be favorably impacted.\nThe following table presents a roll forward of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of accrued interest, as of December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\nFederal income tax returns for 2017 through 2019 remain open to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), while state and local income tax returns for 2016 through 2019 also generally remain open to examination by state taxing authorities. The 2006 through 2015 income tax returns are only open to the extent that net operating loss or other tax attributes carrying forward from those years were utilized in 2016 through 2019. The foreign tax returns for 2016 through 2019 also generally remain open to examination. During 2020, we completed an audit of our 2016 U.S. federal income tax return by the Internal Revenue Service and began an audit of our 2016 and 2017 California income tax returns for which we are currently in the closing phase with the Franchise Tax Board. Additionally, we have been notified that an audit will commence for Axon Public Safety Southeast Asia LLC, our entity in Vietnam. The tax period has not yet been defined.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision (benefit) for income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had accrued interest of $\n0.2\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion, respectively.\n12. Line of Credit\nWe have a $\n50.0\nmillion unsecured revolving line of credit with a domestic bank, of which $\n10.0\nmillion is available for letters of credit. The credit agreement matures on December 31, 2021 and has an accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total line of credit up to $\n100.0\nmillion, subject to certain conditions, including the availability of additional bank commitments. On January 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which extends the term of the credit agreement to December 31, 2023 and increases the amount of the unsecured revolving line of credit which is available for letters of credit from $\n10\nmillion to $\n20\nmillion.\n75\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were\nno\nborrowings under the line. Under the terms of the line of credit, available borrowings are reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately $\n6.1\nmillion under the facility and available borrowing of $\n43.9\nmillion. Advances under the line of credit bear interest at LIBOR plus\n1.0\nto\n1.5\n% per year determined in accordance with a pricing grid based on our funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio.\nWe are required to comply with a maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio of no greater than\n2.50\nto 1.00 based upon a trailing four fiscal quarter period. At December 31, 2020, our funded debt to EBITDA ratio was\n0.0000\nto 1.00.\n13. Stockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock\nWe have authorized the issuance of\ntwo\nclasses of stock designated as “common stock” and “preferred stock,” each having a par value of $\n0.00001\nper share. We are authorized to issue\n200\nmillion shares of common stock and\n25\nmillion shares of preferred stock.\nStock-based Compensation Plans\nWe have historically utilized stock-based compensation, consisting of RSUs and stock options, for key employees and non-employee directors as a means of attracting and retaining quality personnel. Service-based grants generally have a vesting period of\n2\nto\n5 years\nand a contractual maturity of\nten years\n. Performance-based grants generally have vesting periods ranging from\n1\nto\n10 years\nand a contractual maturity of\nten years\n.\nOn February 12, 2019, our shareholders approved the 2019 Plan, which was adopted by the Board of Directors to reserve a sufficient number of shares to facilitate our XSPP and grants of XSUs under the plan. Under the 2019 Plan, we reserved for future grants: (i)\n6.0\nmillion shares of common stock, plus (ii) the number of shares of common stock that were authorized but unissued under our 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) and all prior Company equity plans as of the effective date of the 2019 Plan, and (iii) the number of shares of stock that have been granted under the prior plans that either terminate, expire or lapse for any reason after the effective date of the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, approximately\n1.9\nmillion shares remain available for future grants. Shares issued upon exercise of stock awards from these plans have historically been issued from our authorized unissued shares.\nPerformance-based stock awards\nWe have issued performance-based stock options and performance-based RSUs, the vesting of which is generally contingent upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to our operating performance, as well as successful and timely development and market acceptance of future product introductions. In addition, certain of the performance RSUs have additional service requirements subsequent to the achievement of the performance criteria. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period based on management’s estimate of the probability of the performance criteria being satisfied, adjusted at each balance sheet date. For both service-based and performance-based RSUs, we account for forfeitures as they occur as a reduction to stock-based compensation expense and additional paid-in-capital\nCEO Performance Award\nOn May 24, 2018, our stockholders approved the CEO Performance Award of\n6,365,856\nstock option awards. The CEO Performance Award consists of\n12\nvesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational goals (performance conditions) and market capitalization goals (market conditions), assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each attainment date. Each of the\n12\nvesting tranches of the CEO Performance Award have a\n10-year\ncontractual term and will\n76\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nvest upon certification by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) that both (i) the market capitalization goal for such tranche, which begins at $\n2.5\nbillion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $\n1.0\nbillion thereafter, and (ii) any one of the following\neight\noperational goals focused on revenue or\neight\noperational goals focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of the CEO Performance Award (\"Adjusted EBITDA (CEO Performance Award)\") is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, investment interest income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expense.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2020, the following operational goals were considered probable of achievement:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the following operational goals were achieved, with vesting of the related tranche pending certification by the Compensation Committee:\nStock-based compensation expense associated with the CEO Performance Award is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for each pair of market capitalization and operational goals, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational goal is considered probable of being met. The probability of meeting an operational goal and the expected achievement point in time for meeting a probable operational goal are based on a subjective assessment of our forward-looking financial projections, taking into consideration statistical analysis. Even though no tranches of the CEO Performance Award vest unless a market capitalization and a matching operational goal are both achieved, stock-based compensation expense is recognized when an operational goal is considered probable of achievement regardless of whether a market capitalization goal is actually achieved. Stock-based compensation represents a non-cash expense and is recorded in sales, general, and administrative operating expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nThe first four market capitalization goals have been achieved as of December 31, 2020, and the fifth and sixth market capitalization goals were achieved in January and February 2021, respectively. However, none of the stock options granted under the CEO Performance Award have vested thus far as attainment of the first tranche has not been certified by the Compensation Committee, and none of the other operational goals have been achieved. As there are ten operational goals considered probable of achievement and one achieved operational goal, we recorded stock-based compensation expense\n77\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nof $\n93.8\nmillion related to the CEO Performance Award from the CEO Grant Date through December 31, 2020. The number of stock options that will vest related to the achieved tranche is approximately\n0.5\nmillion shares. The number of stock options that would vest related to the remaining ten probable tranches is approximately\n5.3\nmillion shares.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $\n134.5\nmillion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award for the operational goals that were considered probable of achievement, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n5.1\nyears. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $\n17.6\nmillion for the operational goal that was considered not probable of achievement.\neXponential Stock Performance Plan\nOn February 12, 2019, our shareholders approved the 2019 Plan, which was adopted by the Board of Directors to reserve a sufficient number of shares to facilitate our XSPP and grants of XSUs under the plan. Pursuant to the XSPP, all eligible full-time U.S. employees were granted an award of\n60\nXSUs in January 2019, and certain employees had the opportunity to elect to receive a percentage of the value of their target compensation over the following\nnine years\n(2019-2027) in the form of additional XSUs. For employees who elected to receive XSUs, the XSU grants were made as an up front, lump sum grant in January 2019, and are intended to replace that portion of the target compensation they elected to receive in the form of XSUs for the subsequent\nnine years\n. Accordingly, their go forward target compensation will be reduced until 2027 by the amount of such compensation that the employees elected to receive in the form of the January 2019 XSU grants. Additional employee awards were granted approximately quarterly during 2019 and 2020. A total of approximately\n0.3\nmillion XSUs were granted during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe XSUs are grants of restricted stock units, each with a term of approximately\nnine years\n, that vest in\n12\nequal tranches. Each of the\n12\ntranches will vest upon certification by the Compensation Committee that both (i) the market capitalization goal for such tranche, which begins at $\n2.5\nbillion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $\n1.0\nbillion thereafter, and (ii) any one of\neight\noperational goals focused on revenue or\neight\noperational goals focused on Adjusted EBITDA (CEO Performance Award) have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters.\nThe XSPP contains an anti-dilution provision incorporated into the plan based on shareholder feedback, which affects the calculation of the market capitalization goals in the plan. The plan defines a maximum number of shares outstanding that may be used in the calculation of the market capitalization goals (the “XSU Maximum”). If the actual number of shares outstanding exceeds the XSU Maximum guardrail, then the lower pre-defined number of shares in the XSU Maximum, rather than the higher actual number of shares outstanding, is used to calculate market capitalization for the determination of the market capitalization goals in the XSPP, which, together with the operational goals, determines whether XSUs vest for participating employees.\nThe XSU Maximum is defined as the actual number of shares outstanding on the original XSU grant date of January 2, 2019, increased by a\n3\n%\nannual rate over the term of the XSPP and by shares issued upon the exercise of CEO Performance Award options. The XSU Maximum is also adjusted for acquisitions, spin-offs or other changes in the number of outstanding shares of common stock, if such changes have a corresponding adjustment on the market capitalization goals.\nNew shares issued for any other reasons, including shares issued upon vesting of XSUs, RSUs, and PSUs as well as shares issued to raise capital through equity issuances or in other transactions, do not increase the XSU Maximum.\nThe market capitalization and operational goals are identical to the CEO Performance Award, but a different number of shares is used to calculate the market capitalization goals if shares outstanding exceed the XSU Maximum. Additionally, because the grant date is different than that of the CEO Performance Award, the measurement period for market capitalization is not identical.\n78\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nStock-based compensation expense associated with XSU awards is recognized over the longest explicit, implicit or derived service period for each pair of market capitalization and operational goals, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational goal is considered probable of being met. The market capitalization goal period and the valuation of each tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is also used as the basis for determining the expected achievement period of the market capitalization goal. The probability of meeting an operational goal and the expected achievement point in time for meeting a probable operational goal are based on a subjective assessment of our forward-looking financial projections, taking into consideration statistical analysis. Even though no tranches of the XSU awards vest unless a market capitalization and a matching operational goal are both achieved, stock-based compensation expense is recognized when an operational goal is considered probable of achievement regardless of whether a market capitalization goal is actually achieved.\nAs of December 31, 2020, actual shares outstanding exceeded the XSU Maximum as a result of the common stock offering completed in June 2020. Accordingly, market capitalization as calculated for the purposes of achieving additional goals uses the lower XSU Maximum share amount rather than actual shares outstanding. The first four market capitalization goals have been achieved as of December 31, 2020, and the fifth and sixth market capitalization goals were achieved in January and February 2021, respectively. While none of the XSU tranches have vested thus far, the first operational was achieved as of December 31, 2020 and the related tranche will vest upon certification from the Compensation Committee. The remaining probable operational goals have not yet been achieved as of December 31, 2020. As there are ten operational goals considered probable of achievement and one achieved operational goal, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $\n58.3\nmillion related to the XSU awards from their respective grant dates through December 31, 2020. The number of XSU awards that will vest related to the achieved tranche is approximately\n0.4\nmillion shares. The number of XSU awards that would vest related to the remaining ten probable tranches is approximately\n4.5\nmillion shares.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $\n121.3\nmillion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the XSU awards for the operational goals that were considered probable of achievement, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n4.66\nyears. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $\n11.3\nmillion for the operational goal that was considered not probable of achievement.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the years ended December 31 (number of units and aggregate intrinsic value in thousands):\n​\n​\nAggregate intrinsic value represents our closing stock price on the last trading day of the period, which was $\n122.53\nper share at December 31, 2020, multiplied by the number of RSUs. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the year was $\n56.0\nmillion, $\n39.4\nmillion, and $\n36.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n79\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nCertain RSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2020 were net-share settled, such that we withheld shares to cover the employees’ tax obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. Total shares withheld during 2020 were\n0.1\nmillion and had a value of approximately $\n6.6\nmillion on their respective vesting dates as determined by the closing stock price of our stock. Payments for the employees’ tax obligations are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. We record a liability for the tax withholding to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $\n67.6\nmillion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs under our stock plans for shares that are expected to vest. We expect to recognize the cost related to the RSUs over a weighted average period of\n2.35\nyears.\nRSUs are released when vesting requirements are met.\nPerformance Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes PSU activity, inclusive of XSUs, for the years ended December 31 (number of units and aggregate intrinsic value in thousands):\n​\nAggregate intrinsic value represents our closing stock price on the last trading day of the period, which was\n$\n122.53\nper share, multiplied by the number of PSUs outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, there was\n$\n127.4\nmillion in unrecognized compensation costs related to PSUs under our stock plans for shares that are expected to vest. We expect to recognize the cost related to the PSUs over a weighted average period of\n4.49\nyears. PSUs are released when vesting requirements are met.\nOf the\n0.4\nmillion performance-based RSUs granted in 2020,\n0.3\nmillion were XSUs. Certain of the performance-based RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2020 can vest with a range of shares earned being between\n0\n% and\n200\n% of the targeted shares granted, depending on the final achievement of pre-determined performance criteria as of the vesting date.\nThe amount of PSUs included in the table above related to such grants is the target level. The maximum additional number of PSUs that could be earned is\n0.2\nmillion, which are not included in the table above.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the performance criteria had been met for approximately\n0.2\nmillion of the\n0.3\nmillion performance-based RSUs outstanding, exclusive of XSUs outstanding. We recognized $\n48.3\nmillion, $\n24.1\nmillion and $\n4.8\nmillion of compensation expense related to performance-based RSUs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which included expense related to XSUs of $\n40.8\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn November 3, 2020, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a modification to the definition of a metric for certain of our outstanding PSU awards. We accounted for this change as a Type III modification under ASC 718 since the expectation of the attainment for this metric changed from improbable to probable. We will recognize additional stock-based compensation of approximately\n$\n6.4\nmillion over the remaining requisite service period, beginning from the modification date; of this total,\n$\n3.2\nmillion was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCertain PSUs that vested in the year ended December 31, 2020 were net-share settled such that we withheld shares to cover the employees’ tax obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the\n80\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nappropriate taxing authorities. Total shares withheld related to PSUs were approximately\n16\nthousand and had a value of $\n1.2\nmillion on their respective vesting dates as determined by the closing stock price on such dates. Payments for the employees’ tax obligations are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. We record a liability for the tax withholding to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nStock Option Activity\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the years ended December 31 (number of options in thousands):\n​\n​\nWe granted\n6.4\nmillion stock options in 2018 and\nnone\nin 2020 or 2019. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $\n5.1\nmillion, $\n1.2\nmillion and $\n28.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The intrinsic value for options exercised was calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock option awards and the market price of our common stock on the date of exercise.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options that were fully vested or expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 (number of options in thousands):\n​\n​\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2020 was $\n49.8\nmillion, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the underlying stock option awards and the closing market price of our common stock of $\n122.53\non December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had\n6.4\nmillion unvested options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $\n28.58\nper share, weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n38.64\nper share and weighted average remaining contractual life of\n7.2\nyears. The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested options at December 31, 2020 was $\n598.1\nmillion.\n81\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nWe account for stock-based compensation using the fair-value method. Reported stock-based compensation expense was classified as follows for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\nStock Inducement Plan\nIn September 2019, our Board of Directors adopted the Axon Enterprise, Inc. 2019 Stock Inducement Plan (the “2019 Inducement Plan”) pursuant to which we reserved\n500,000\nshares of common stock for issuance under the Inducement Plan. The 2019 Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) and Rule 5635(c)(3) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units, and its terms are substantially similar to our stockholder-approved 2019 Plan. In accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) and Rule 5635(c)(3) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, awards under the Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals not previously employees or non-employee directors of the Company (or following such individuals’ bona fide period of non-employment with the Company), as an inducement material to the individuals’ entry into employment with the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were\n29,600\nshares available for grant under the 2019 Inducement Plan.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn February 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $\n50.0\nmillion of our outstanding common stock subject to stock market conditions and corporate considerations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $\n16.3\nmillion remained available under the plan for future purchases.\n14. Leases\nLease Obligations\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Additionally, we use the portfolio approach in determining the discount rate used to present value lease payments. We give consideration to our line of credit as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when estimating our incremental borrowing rates. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and excludes lease incentives.\nWe have operating and finance leases for office space and certain equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases beginning on or after January 1, 2019, we account for lease components separately from non-lease components for all asset classes.\nOur leases have remaining terms of less than 1 to approximately\n7 years\n, some of which include one or more options to renew for up to\n5 years\n, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within\n1 year\n. The exercise of lease\n82\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nrenewal options is at our sole discretion and such options are included in ROU assets and liabilities for renewal periods that are reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of our lease agreements include stated rental payment escalations. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. We sublease certain real estate to third parties. Finance leases as of December 31, 2020 were immaterial.\n​\n​\nThe components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):\n​\nOther information related to leases was as follows (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate):\n​\n83\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nAs of December 31, 2020, we do not have any leases that have not yet commenced that create significant rights and obligations for us.\n15. Employee Benefit Plans\nWe have a defined contribution profit sharing 401(k) plan for eligible employees, which is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Employees are entitled to make tax-deferred contributions of up to the maximum allowed by law of their eligible compensation.\nWe also have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives, key employees and non-employee directors through which participants may elect to postpone the receipt and taxation of a portion of their compensation, including stock-based compensation, received from us. The non-qualified deferred compensation plan allows eligible participants to defer up to\n80\n% of their base salary and up to\n100\n% of other types of compensation. The plan also allows for matching and discretionary employer contributions. Employee deferrals are deemed\n100\n% vested upon contribution. Distributions from the plan generally commence upon retirement, death, separation of service, specified date or upon the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency. Distributions can be paid in a variety of forms from lump sum to installments over a period of years. Participants in the plan are entitled to select from a wide variety of investments available under the plan and are allocated gains or losses based upon the performance of the investments selected by the participant. All gains or losses are allocated fully to plan participants and we do not guarantee a rate of return on deferred balances. Assets related to this plan consist of corporate-owned life insurance contracts and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets; see Note 8 for balances. Participants have no rights or claims with respect to any plan assets and any such assets are subject to the claims of our general creditors.\nContributions to the plans are made by both the employee and us. Our contributions to the 401(k) plan are based on the level of employee contributions and are immediately vested. Future matching contributions to the plans are at our sole discretion.\nWe also sponsor defined contribution plans in Australia, Finland, and the United Kingdom.\nOur matching contributions for all defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were approximately $\n5.6\nmillion, $\n4.8\nmillion and $\n3.2\nmillion, respectively. Future matching or profit sharing contributions to the plans are at our sole discretion.\n84\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\n16. Business Acquisitions\nVievu\nOn May 3, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding ownership interests of Vievu, a public safety camera and cloud-based evidence management system provider for law enforcement agencies.\nThe purchase price of $\n17.6\nmillion consisted of $\n5.0\nmillion in cash, net of cash acquired of $\n0.1\nmillion, and $\n2.4\nmillion, or\n58,843\nshares, of our common stock issued to Vievu’s parent company, Safariland, LLC (“Safariland”). Additionally, the purchase price consisted of contingent consideration of up to $\n6.0\nmillion, or\n141,226\nadditional shares of common stock, if certain conditions relating to retention of certain Vievu customers are met as of the first and second anniversaries of the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was $\n5.8\nmillion. The purchase price also included the fair value of a long-term Product Development and Supplier Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Safariland, pursuant to which Safariland will be our preferred provider of holsters for our CEW products. The estimated fair value of the Supply Agreement as of the acquisition date was $\n4.5\nmillion, a portion of which was recorded within accrued liabilities and the remaining portion recorded within other long-term liabilities.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\nWe assigned the goodwill to the Software and Sensors segment. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets were assigned a total weighted average amortization period of\n5.1\nyears. Vievu has been included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred and expensed costs of approximately $\n0.8\nmillion, which included legal, accounting and other third-party expenses related to the transaction. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we recorded expenses of $\n1.2\nmillion in 2018 related to purchase commitments assumed in the Vievu business combination that exceeded estimated future demand.\n17. Segment Data\nOur operations are comprised of\ntwo\nreportable segments: the TASER segment and the Software and Sensors segment. In both segments, we report sales of products and services. Service revenue in both segments includes sales related to Axon Evidence. In the TASER segment, service revenue also includes digital subscription training content. In the Software and Sensors segment, service revenue also includes other recurring cloud-hosted software revenue and related professional services. Collectively, this revenue is sometimes referred to as \"Axon Cloud revenue.\"  Our Chief Executive Officer, who is the CODM, is not provided asset information or sales, general, and administrative expense by segment.\n85\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\nInformation relative to our reportable segments was as follows (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n86\nAXON ENTERPRISE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n​\n18. Supplemental Disclosure to Cash Flows\nSupplemental non-cash and other cash flow information were as follows as of and for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n87\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nAxon Enterprise, Inc.\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition – Bundled Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nAs described further in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, the Company derives revenue from two primary sources: the sale of physical products (including conducted energy devices (CEDs), cameras, corresponding hardware extended warranties, and related accessories), and subscriptions to the Axon Evidence digital evidence management software as a service and support. To a lesser extent, the Company also recognizes revenue related to training, professional services and other software services. Many of the Company’s products are sold on a standalone basis; however, the Company also bundles its hardware product and service performance obligations and sells them to customers as part of a single transaction.\n88\nWe consider the identification of performance obligations, treatment of contract term assessments, the determination of the standalone selling price and allocation of the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, including the determination as to whether any amendments to an existing contract result in a modification, to be a critical audit matter.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that these revenue recognition matters are a critical audit matter is that significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for contracts with multiple performance obligations, and includes the following:\nThese judgments require significant auditor subjectivity in evaluating the reasonableness of those judgments. Our audit procedures related to the revenue recognition for contracts with multiple performance obligations included the following, among others:\n​\n89\nStock Based Compensation – Ongoing Assessment of Vesting Probabilities\nAs described further in Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements, the CEO Performance Award provides for the granting of stock options to the Company’s CEO and the XSPP provides for the granting of eXponential Stock Units (XSUs) to the Company’s employees.  Both the stock options and XSUs vest in 12 tranches upon the achievement of market capitalization and operational goals. Stock-based compensation expense associated with the awards is recognized beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational goal is considered probable of being met. We consider the probability assessment of achieving the operational goals to be a critical audit matter.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that the probability of achieving the operational goals is a critical audit matter is that significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining the achievement of the operational goals for these awards, and includes the following:\nThese judgments are subject to estimation uncertainty and require significant auditor subjectivity in evaluating the reasonableness of those judgments. Our audit procedures related to the ongoing assessment of vesting probabilities included the following, among others:\n​\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nPhoenix, Arizona\nFebruary 25, 2021\n​\n90\n​"

This “Controls and Procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications. This section should be read in conjunction with the certifications and the Grant Thornton LLP attestation report for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. Grant Thornton LLP has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2020 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria set forth in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Grant Thornton LLP has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n91\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nAxon Enterprise, Inc.\n​\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework\nissued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our report dated February 25, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nPhoenix, Arizona\nFebruary 25, 2021\n​\n92"
