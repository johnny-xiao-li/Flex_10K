We operate Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. as one enterprise and, therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Prologis, L.P. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We have a significant ownership interest in the co-investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity.\nPrologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code” or “IRC”). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. Prologis, L.P. was also formed in 1997.\nWe operate and manage our business on an owned and managed (“O&M”) basis and therefore evaluate the operating performance of the properties in our O&M portfolio, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which we manage. We make operating decisions based on our total O&M portfolio, as we manage the properties similarly regardless of ownership. We evaluate our results based on our proportionate economic ownership of each property included in the O&M portfolio (“our share”) to reflect our share of the financial results of the O&M portfolio.\nIncluded in our discussion below are references to funds from operations (“FFO”) and net operating income (“NOI”), neither of which are U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of\nNet Earnings Attributable to Common Stockholders\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income to our FFO measures and a reconciliation of NOI to\nOperating Income,\nthe most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nOur corporate headquarters is located at Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, and our other principal office locations are in Amsterdam, Denver, Luxembourg, Mexico City, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.\nOur Internet address is www.prologis.com. All reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available and can be accessed free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website. The common stock of Prologis, Inc. is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker “PLD” and is a component of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500.\nTHE COMPANY\nWe are the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high growth markets. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in 19 countries across four continents. Our local teams actively manage our portfolio, which encompasses leasing, property management, capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions. Our disposition activities allow us to recycle capital and largely self-fund our development and acquisition activities. The majority of our properties in the United States (“U.S.”) are wholly owned, while our international properties are primarily held in our co-investment ventures, which has the benefit of mitigating our exposure to foreign currency movements.\nOur portfolio is focused on the world’s most vibrant centers of commerce and our scale allows us to respond to our customers’ needs for the highest-quality buildings across these locations. There is an emergence of two new structural demand drivers for our real estate: (i) the need for more inventory as supply chains emphasize resilience over efficiency and (ii) the acceleration of e-commerce adoption.\n3\nAs\nservice time\nincreasingly moves to the forefront of the global supply chain, it drives demand for logistics real estate close\nto\nthe end\n-\nconsumer.\nWe\nhave invested in properties located withi\nn infill and urban areas in our\nlargest global markets with\nsame day\naccess\n(defined as\nLast Touch\n®\n)\nand next day\naccess\n(defined as\ncity distribution\n)\n,\nto the consumer population.\nThis\npositioning gives us the unique ability to provide our customers with the right\nreal estate\nsolutions\nfor\ntheir supply chains\nthat,\nin turn\n,\nallows them to meet end\n-c\nonsumer\ndelivery\nexpectations.\nAs we look to the future of logistics real estate, we are focused on solving our customers’ pain points, innovating in pursuit of creative solutions and operational excellence. We are listening and responding to our customers’ needs for skilled labor through initiatives to create community workforce programs to develop their talent pool, utilize our proprietary data and analytics to ensure efficient distribution solutions and negotiate better pricing on common products and services that our customers need. Our customers turn to us because they know that a strategic partnership with Prologis is a competitive advantage. We accomplish all of this by employing individuals who continue to grow, embrace change and draw strength from inclusion and diversity.\nAt December 31, 2020, we owned or had investments in properties, on a wholly-owned basis or through ventures, in the following geographies (dollars in billions, based on gross book value and total expected investment (as defined below) and square feet in millions):\n2020 Significant Events\nOn January 8, 2020, our two U.S. co-investment ventures, Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture, LLC (“USLV”) and Prologis Targeted U.S. Logistics Fund (“USLF”), acquired the wholly-owned real estate assets of Industrial Property Trust Inc. (“IPT”) for approximately $2.0 billion each, which we refer to as the “IPT Transaction” and is detailed in Notes 4, 5, 8 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The portfolio included 235 properties, aggregating 37 million square feet and were highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. Our aggregate investment in the IPT Transaction was $1.6 billion.\nOn February 4, 2020, we acquired Liberty Property Trust and Liberty Property Limited Partnership (collectively “Liberty”) through a merger transaction that we refer to as the “Liberty Transaction” and is detailed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Liberty portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 519 operating properties, aggregating 100 million square feet and were highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. The portfolio also included properties under development, land for future development and office properties. The acquisition expanded our presence in target markets such as Lehigh Valley, Chicago, Houston, Central Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Southern California. The total acquisition price, including transaction costs, was approximately $13 billion and was funded through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategy, we integrated the IPT and Liberty properties while adding minimal property management and general and administrative expenses, further scaling our operations.\nOn a combined basis, there were 42 million square feet of non-strategic industrial properties with a gross book value of approximately $3 billion acquired in both the Liberty Transaction and the IPT Transaction\nthat we do not intend to operate long-term\n. Depending on the expected hold period, these assets were either classified as\nAssets Held for Sale or Contribution\nor\nother real estate investments within\nInvestments in Real Estate Properties\nat the time of acquisition in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since acquisition some of these non-strategic industrial properties have been sold.\n4\nIn early 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted financial markets and global, national and local economies since this time. Our operating results have remained strong in the COVID-19 environment and our business has been resilient. We expect operating conditions in our portfolio to continue to strengthen in 2021. However, with the continued uncertainty across the globe, we cannot predict the impact on our business, future financial condition or operating results. For discussion on current operating results and our operational and financial outlook, as well as our response to help protect employees and customers, see\nthe Summary of 2020 section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThroughout this discussion, we reflect amounts in U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital.\nBelow is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years (in millions):\nReal Estate Operations\nRental.\nRental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85% to 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and funds from operations (“FFO”). We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents as leases expire. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy, sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize NOI across our portfolio. A majority of our consolidated rental revenue, NOI and cash flows are generated in the U.S.\nDevelopment.\nGiven the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets, our development business provides us the opportunity to build what our customers need. We develop properties to meet these needs, deepen our market presence and maintain a modern portfolio. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our land bank and redevelopment sites; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; and (iii) the depth of our customer relationships. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased, generate income and increase the net asset value of our Real Estate Operations segment. Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land, including options, has the potential to support the development of $11.8 billion of TEI of new logistics space. In addition to our land portfolio, we have also made investments in other properties that have the potential to be redeveloped to increase value. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.\nStrategic Capital\nOur strategic capital segment allows us to partner with many of the world’s largest institutional investors and capitalize our business through private equity, principally perpetual open-ended or long-term ventures. We also access capital in this segment through two publicly traded vehicles: Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico. We align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our 9 unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15% to 50%), which allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the U.S.\n5\nThis segment produces stable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10% to 15% of our recurring consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset and property management services. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (“promotes” or “promote revenues”) periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. We plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. Most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. NOI in this segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as\nStrategic Capital Revenues\nless\nStrategic Capital Expenses\nand excludes property-related NOI.\nFUTURE GROWTH\nWe believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows.\n6\nCompetition\nReal estate ownership is highly fragmented, and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators. Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating results. We may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business.\nDespite the competition we may face, our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages, including the following:\nCustomers\nOur broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local logistics users. At December 31, 2020, in our Real Estate Operations segment representing our consolidated properties, we had more than 3,400 customers occupying 446 million square feet of logistics operating properties.\n7\nIn order to provide for a customer-centric location strategy, we have invested in properties located within infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day and next day access to the consumer population, these are our Last Touch\n®\nand city distribution facilities, respectively. To support these distribution facilities, we utilize multi-market facilities located at key transportation hubs on the edge of these major infill and urban areas and gateway distribution facilities that incorporate access to major sea and intermodal ports. Below are the primary categories of goods in our buildings for our consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table details our top 25 customers for our consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2020 (square feet in millions):\n8\nIn our Strategic Capital segment, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 128 investors in our private equity ventures, several of which invest in multiple ventures.\nEmployees\nWe believe our employees are the most important part of our business. When attracting, developing and retaining talent, we seek individuals who hold varied experiences and viewpoints to create an inclusive and diverse culture and workplace that allows each employee to do their best work and drive our collective success. We focus on leadership development at every level of the organization. We align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction to create a clear link between individual efforts and the long-term success of the company and then provide effective feedback on their performance towards goals to ensure their growth. We believe a commitment to our employees’ learning and development through training, educational opportunities and mentorship is critical to our ability to continue to innovate. Through performance plans, talent recognition and individual development planning, along with reward packages, we advance our talent pool and create a sustainable and long-term enterprise.\nFor additional discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, see\nthe Summary of 2020 section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes our total number of employees at December 31, 2020:\nWe allocate the personnel costs related to providing property management and leasing functions to our Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments based on the square footage of the respective portfolios. The personnel costs to perform only Strategic Capital functions are allocated directly to that segment.\nWe believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, other than in Brazil, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such, benefit from applicable labor agreements.\nCODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT\nWe maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website,\nwww.prologis.com\n. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website.\nENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”)\nOur long-standing dedication to ESG creates value for our company by strengthening our relationships with our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business. The principles of ESG are an important aspect of our business strategy, delivering a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment. We develop modern and efficient building designs with state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of our customers’ needs while advancing structural, transportation, and energy requirements. We invest in sustainable design features and practices, such as the addition of solar panels, cool roofs, light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting, electric vehicle charging stations, waste diversion, recycling and xeriscaping, that result in cost-savings and operational efficiency for our customers and reduce energy and water consumption, as well as decrease greenhouse gas emissions across our portfolio and corporate operations.\nWe have a comprehensive carbon strategy that includes science-based targets to address our global carbon footprint.\nWe are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships, investor outreach, community involvement, labor solutions, and inclusion and diversity initiatives, as well as a focus on our employees and our customers’ employees through health and wellness programs and building design. Through our community workforce initiative, for example, we are\nhelping build a talent pipeline for our customers with an emphasis on revitalizing career pathways and creating economic opportunities in the communities where we operate.\nWe set an ambitious goal to train 25,000 individuals by 2025 by partnering with leading public sector organizations and leveraging learning technologies to develop innovative training solutions.\nOur strong governance and oversight creates a culture of uncompromising integrity. Our Board independence and diversity, open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions all serve\n9\nto mitigate risk and preserve value for our company.\nThe strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, ability to stay ahead of\ncustomer needs,\nand\nengagement with our employees through ethics and anti-corruption training, along with stockholder outreach ensures the financial, operational and reputation\nal\nresilience of our organization for the long-term. Our approach is reinforced by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as described above.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nWe are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we think would have a material adverse effect beyond amounts recorded as of December 31, 2020. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nGOVERNMENTAL MATTERS\nWe are exposed to various regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses, adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations. The impact of regional or country-specific economic instability, including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nINSURANCE COVERAGE\nWe carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors."

    "text": "Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including but not limited to, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities. These risks relate to Prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others, (i) risks related to our global operations (ii) risks related to our business; (iii) risks related to financing and capital; (iv) risks related to income taxes; and (v) general risks.\nRisks Related to our Global Operations\nAs a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the U.S. During 2020, we generated approximately $484 million or 10.9% of our consolidated revenues from operations outside the U.S. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include, but are not limited to, the following factors:\n10\nIn addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other factors.\nCompliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs.\nWe are required to comply with many regulations in different countries, including (but not limited to) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and state and local fire and life-safety requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us.\nDisruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nTo the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties; (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing; (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due; and (iv) the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders.\nThe depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2020, approximately $8.6 billion or 15.3% of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $289 million or 8.9% of our total consolidated segment NOI, as disclosed in Note\n17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\nwas denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and, specifically, our U.S. dollar reported financial position and results of operations.\nOur hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks.\nWe attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments. We enter into other foreign currency contracts, such as forwards, to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow\nassociated with the translation of future\nearnings\nof our international subsidiaries.\nAlthough we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful.\nHedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. The funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage. The failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Business\nGeneral economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results.\nWe are exposed to the economic conditions and other events and occurrences in the local, regional, national and international geographies in which we own properties. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties.\nAt December 31, 2020, 30.9% of our consolidated operating properties or $13.6 billion (based on consolidated gross book value, or investment before depreciation) were located in California (Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California markets),\n11\nwhich represented\n26.2\n% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and\n27.1\n% of our NOI. Our revenues from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of the investment we have located in California, a downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions\n, including state income tax and property tax laws,\ncould adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to California, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3% of total consolidated investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain markets located in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Lehigh Valley, New Jersey/New York City, Seattle and South Florida. Of these markets, no single market contributed more than 10% of our total consolidated investment before depreciation. Our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties. Conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. Any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business.\nOur O&M portfolio, which includes our wholly-owned properties and properties included in our co-investment ventures, has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in France, Japan, Mexico and the U.K., and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets.\nReal estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors.\nReal estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. Significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage debt payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. As a REIT, under the IRC, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable REIT subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property. We may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity. If we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale, we may not pursue such sales.\nWe may decide to sell or contribute properties to certain of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures or sell properties to third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities. Our ability to sell or contribute properties on advantageous terms is affected by: (i) competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties; (ii) economic and market conditions, including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties; and (iii) other factors beyond our control. If our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all. The unconsolidated co-investment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire properties from us. Should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions and contributions could be delayed.\nIf we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations, sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting properties at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business, and in particular, our distributable cash flow and debt covenants.\nOur investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector.\nOur investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified.\nInvestments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business.\nInvestments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. While we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our asset management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. Factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include:\n12\nThese factors may affect our ability to recover our investment in the properties and result in impairment charges.\nOur customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire.\nOur operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. At December 31, 2020, our top 10 customers accounted for 16.3% of our consolidated NER. In the event of default by a significant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and we may be unable to re-lease spaces. A customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. In addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow.\nWe are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers, the space may not be re-leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire or we may lose potential customers.\nWe may acquire properties and companies that involves risks which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties through the direct acquisition of real estate, the acquisition of entities that own real estate or through additional investments in co-investment ventures that acquire properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. The acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities, including tax liabilities, which may be without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based on our new ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it.\nWe may be unable to integrate the operations of newly acquired companies and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated timeframe. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include: (i) the inability to dispose of non-industrial assets or operations that are outside of our area of expertise; (ii) potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with these transactions; and (iii) performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing these transactions and integrating the companies’ operations.\nOur real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful.\nOur real estate development and redevelopment strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for long-term investment, contribution or sale to a co-investment venture or third party, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. We may increase our investment in the development, renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the build-out and leasing of our current development portfolio. We may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed co-investment ventures. The real estate development, renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks:\n13\nWe are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming co-investment ventures, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures, attracting third-party investment and managing properties through co-investment ventures.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had investments in co-investment ventures, both public and private, that owned operating properties with a gross book value of approximately $49 billion. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, or attract third-party investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful. Further, there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from our existing or future investments. The same factors that impact the valuation of our consolidated portfolio, as discussed above, also impact the portfolios held by the co-investment ventures and could result in other than temporary impairment of our investment and a reduction in fee revenues.\nOur co-investment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face, including:\nWe generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives; however, we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely. We have formed publicly traded investment vehicles, such as NPR and FIBRA Prologis, for which we serve as sponsor or manager. These entities bear their own risks related to trading markets, foreign currency exchange rates and market demand. We have contributed, and may continue to contribute, assets into such vehicles. There is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated.\nWe are exposed to various environmental risks, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.\n14\nEnvironmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials.\nIn addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Furthermore, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.\nOur insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses.\nWe and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our co-investment ventures are adequately insured. Certain losses, however, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots and pandemics, generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property.\nFurthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business.\nA number of our investments, both wholly-owned and owned through co-investment ventures, are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in California and Seattle. International properties located in active seismic areas include Japan and Mexico. We generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self-insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. We have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in Japan based on this analysis.\nFurthermore, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.\nRisks Related to Financing and Capital\nWe may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments.\nWe are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. Our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. Increases in market interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements.\nCovenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe terms of our various credit agreements, including our credit facilities, the indentures under which our senior notes and term loans are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios, leverage ratios, fixed charge coverage ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance\n15\ncoverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness. If we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, our business and financial condition generally and, in particular, the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity.\nAt December 31, 2020, our credit ratings from Moody’s and S&P were A3 and A-, respectively, both with stable outlook. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nThe credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity.\nIn order to meet REIT distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed. Historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, however, we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Furthermore, to maintain our REIT status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the authority that regulates the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 which will require transition to an alternative reference rate that could have a negative impact on our required debt payments and the value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments.\nIn July 2017, the FCA announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, in the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR for debt and derivative financial instruments. In November 2020, the Federal Reserve Board along with various independent groups announced the potential for certain USD LIBOR tenors to continue to be published until June 2023. This change would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the USD LIBOR market, without the need to transition those contracts to SOFR. The expected transition of GBP LIBOR and Yen LIBOR at the end of 2021 was not impacted by this announcement. Additionally, other global regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates (“IBORs”). We refer to these rates collectively as “IBOR-indexed”. At December 31, 2020 we had variable rate debt of $2.0 billion, excluding borrowings that are hedged through interest rate swap agreements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional discussion regarding our variable rate debt.\nOur loan documents contain provisions that contemplate alternative methods to determine the base rate applicable to our IBOR-indexed debt to the extent IBOR-indexed rates are not available. Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our loan documents in the event that the IBOR-indexed rates are not available. If a contract is not transitioned to a preferred alternative rate and IBOR-indexed rates are discontinued, the impact on our debt and derivative financial instruments is likely to vary by contract. If IBOR-indexed rates are discontinued or if the methods of calculating the rates change, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. While we currently expect IBOR-indexed rates to be available until the end of 2021, it is possible that they will become unavailable prior to that time.\nWe anticipate managing the transition to a preferred alternative rate using the language set out in our agreements and through potentially modifying our debt and derivative instruments, however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and we may incur significant associated costs in doing so. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our debt payments and value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments, however, we are not able to predict when IBOR-indexed rates will cease to be available.\n16\nOur stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the OP.\nAny additional future issuance of common stock or OP units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors. In most circumstances, stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or OP units and the utilization of the proceeds, our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units.\nRisks Related to Income Tax\nThe failure of Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences.\nPrologis, Inc. elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe Prologis, Inc. has been organized and operated to qualify as a REIT under the IRC and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the IRC to enable Prologis, Inc. to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow Prologis, Inc. to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause Prologis, Inc. to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some annually and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the IRC for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, to qualify as a REIT, Prologis, Inc. must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, Prologis, Inc. must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis.\nHistorically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock.\nThe provisions of the IRC and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated for Prologis, Inc. because we hold substantially all of our assets through the OP.\nIf Prologis, Inc. fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including, for taxable years prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, Prologis, Inc. would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification and would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of REIT re-election if recognized within the five-year period after re-election, and potentially 10 years for certain states. If Prologis, Inc. lost its REIT status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment, operations and distributions would be reduced.\nFurthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs that elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the IRC. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the REIT 95% and 75% gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax. In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would have an adverse effect on the ability of Prologis, Inc. to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus its ability to qualify as a REIT.\nIn addition, we may acquire properties through the acquisition of REIT entities that own the real estate. If a gain in such assets is not otherwise recognized by the seller or target in such acquisitions, and such entities were to fail to satisfy the REIT requirements for any year, they would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which the REIT qualification was lost and the acquired assets would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of REIT re-election or, if earlier, at the time of Prologis’ acquisition of the assets. A sale of such assets within the 5-year recognition period, and potentially 10 years for certain states, could result in corporate tax liabilities that could be significant.\nCertain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction.\nFrom time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. Under the IRC, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the IRS would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT.\n17\nLegislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us.\nIn recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the U.S., state, local and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate, REITs, similar entities and investments. Additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future, both in and outside of the U.S. and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders.\nAny increases in tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.\nOur use of taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities. Under the IRC, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. This limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business may be materially and adversely affected by the impact of the global pandemic of COVID-19.\nThe World Health Organization and certain national and local governments characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted financial markets and global, national and local economies. There are government restrictions on activities across the globe. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business, that of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and our customers for the long-term continues to be uncertain.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of these circumstances, we cannot predict the extent to which the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, but its impact may include the following:\nAny prolonged economic downturn, escalation of the outbreak or disruption in the financial markets may also impact our ability to access capital markets to issue debt or equity securities and to complete real estate transactions at attractive pricing or at all.\nThese items may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and real estate values.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks.\nDespite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses or unauthorized access. Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.\nRisks associated with our dependence on key personnel.\nWe depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. While we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet our needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\n18\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities.\nWe are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our logistics facilities may be exposed to catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases, our exposure to these events could increase. We do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change, as the operation of our buildings typically does not generate a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. However, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors. We cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future. The potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral."

    "text": "The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and the matters described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 is presented below. Information on 2018 is included in graphs only to show year over year trends in our results of operations and operating metrics. Our financial condition for 2018 and results of operations for 2018 and 2019 compared to 2018 can be found under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated by reference herein to our Annual Report on\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 11, 2020, and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.ir.prologis.com.\n25\nMANAGEMENT’S OVERVIEW\nSummary of 2020\nOur financial condition and operating results remain strong in the COVID-19 environment and, in combination with the demand we see in our proprietary data, the pace of rent collections and dialogue with our customers, our outlook continues to improve in the first quarter of 2021. However, with the continued uncertainty across the globe until we put COVID-19 behind us, we cannot predict the impact on our business, future financial condition, and operating results.\nWe experienced minimal impacts from the current environment on our O&M portfolio operating fundamentals in 2020. This is the result of the high quality and location of our real estate portfolio, our customer base, favorable market fundamentals in the logistics real estate sector and significant in-place-to-market rent spreads. E-commerce continues to grow well above its historical average and customers that serve essential daily needs are thriving. Customers that have been negatively impacted by the current economy represent a minimal percentage of our annual rent. Leasing activity remained strong for the O&M portfolio throughout 2020 with the commencement of 150 million square feet of leases with an average term of 66 months, including 37 million square feet in the fourth quarter. Rent change in our O&M portfolio was 21.3% during 2020 and 23.8% in the fourth quarter. We expect market rents to continue to increase in 2021. The average number of days from lease proposal to commencement decreased since 2019 as some customers have increased the pace of activity.\nWe received requests from certain customers for rent concessions during 2020 and for those granted, we deferred the rental payments to a later period in 2020 or 2021. The deferral of rental payments did not impact revenue recognized from those leases. During 2020, on an O&M basis we deferred $45 million of rental payments which represented less than 1% of our total O&M annualized rental revenue. At January 25, 2021, we had collected $33 million, or 98%, of the deferred payments due at December 31\nst\n, with the remainder due in 2021. Although COVID-19 continues to have a minimal impact on our rent collections and bad debt is trending lower than we initially anticipated, we may experience an increase in bad debt.\nOur capital deployment and disposition activities have continued throughout this time and we expect the volume of these activities to accelerate in 2021. By the fourth quarter of 2020, we restarted the majority of the speculative development projects that we suspended in the first quarter.\nOur business continuity, communication plans and technology are allowing all functions of our business to work smoothly during this time. Generally, our employees have continued working remotely or in certain locations in our offices under protocols to keep a safe working environment. We have not had any lay-offs and we have extended financial assistance to employees in need. Our local property and leasing teams have continued to maintain our properties and work with our customers to help them navigate the new environment while following established measures to help keep them and our customers safe. In addition, we are providing assistance across the globe in the form of direct cash grants, supplies and donation of over one million square feet through our Space for Good program. In 2020, through the Prologis Foundation, we pledged $5 million to COVID-19 relief organizations and $1 million in support of racial equality causes.\nWe completed the following significant activities in 2020 as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n26\nIn February 2020, we completed an exchange offer for two series of Liberty’s senior notes for an aggregate amount of $750 million, with $690 million, or 92.0%, of the aggregate principal amount being validly tendered for exchange. These senior notes are included in the aggregate principal amounts of $400 million due in October 2026 with an interest rate of 3.3% and $350 million due in February 2029 with an interest rate of 4.4%. The senior notes were exchanged for notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary and guaranteed by the OP. All other terms of the exchanged Liberty senior notes remained substantially the same.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total available liquidity of $4.8 billion, principally due to current aggregate availability under our credit facilities of $3.9 billion and unrestricted cash balances of $598 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results.\n27\nBelow is a reconciliation of our NOI by segment to\nOperating Income\nper the Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions). Each segment’s NOI is reconciled to a line item in the Consolidated Financial Statements in their respective segment discussions below.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment’s NOI to\nOperating Income\nand\nEarnings Before Income Taxes.\nReal Estate Operations\nThis operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Real Estate Operations segment through\nRental Expenses\nand the Strategic Capital segment through\nStrategic Capital Expenses\nbased on the square footage of the relative portfolios. In addition, this segment is impacted by our development, acquisition and disposition activities.\nBelow are the components of Real Estate Operations revenues, expenses and NOI (in millions), derived directly from the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe change in Real Estate Operations NOI in 2020 compared to 2019 was impacted by the following items (dollars in millions):\n28\nBelow are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio, which excludes non-strategic industrial properties.\nDevelopment Activity\nThe following table summarizes consolidated development activity (dollars and square feet in millions):\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we suspended several recently started speculative development projects for the short-term. Most of the suspended projects were restarted by the fourth quarter of 2020. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding suspended development projects had a TEI of $82 million and remain within our consolidated development portfolio. The remaining active consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and prestabilized properties, is expected to be completed before August 2022 with a TEI of $3.7 billion,\nleaving $1.8 billion remaining to be spent, and\nwas 61.6% leased.\nWe expect our development activities to accelerate in 2021.\nFor additional information on our development portfolio at December 31, 2020, see Item 2. Properties.\n29\nCapital Expenditures\nWe capitalize costs incurred in renovating, improving and leasing our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within other assets. The following graph summarizes our total capital expenditures, excluding development costs, and property improvements per average square foot of our consolidated operating properties during each year:\nStrategic Capital\nThis operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management, other fees for services performed and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated entities. Revenues associated with the Strategic Capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes. These revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Strategic Capital segment through\nStrategic Capital Expenses\nand to the Real Estate Operations segment through\nRental Expenses\nbased on the square footage of the relative portfolios.\nBelow are the components of Strategic Capital revenues, expenses and NOI, derived directly from the Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions):\nBelow is additional detail of our Strategic Capital revenues, expenses and NOI (in millions):\n30\nThe following real estate investments were held through our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on the historical cost at December 31 (dollars and square feet in millions):\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.\nG&A Expenses\nG&A expenses were $275 million and $266 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in 2020 was a contribution of $5 million to the Prologis Foundation for donations to COVID-19 relief organizations. We capitalize certain internal costs, including salaries and related expenses, directly related to our development activities.\nThe following table summarizes capitalized G&A amounts (in millions):\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2020 as compared to 2019 (dollars in millions):\n31\nGains on Real Estate Transactions, Net\nThe following table summarizes our\nGains on Dispositions of Development Properties and Land, Net\n, which primarily includes contributions to our unconsolidated entities, and\nGains on Other Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net\n, which includes sales of operating properties and other real estate transactions, for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nWe utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our capital investments during both periods. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions.\nOur Owned and Managed (“O&M”) Operating Portfolio\nWe manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an O&M basis, which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of GAAP and the presentation of the ventures’ operating information does not represent a legal claim.\nOur O&M operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio, value-added properties, non-industrial properties or properties we do not have the intent to hold long-term that are classified as either held for sale or within other real estate investments.\nValue-added properties are properties that are expected to be repurposed or redeveloped to a higher and better use and recently acquired properties that present opportunities to create greater value.\nSee below for information on our O&M operating portfolio at December 31 (square feet in millions):\n32\nBelow are the key operating metrics summarizing the leasing activity of our O&M operating portfolio.\nSame Store Analysis\nOur same store metrics are non-GAAP financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net effective and cash basis. We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a “same store” analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. We determine our same store metrics on property NOI, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below.\nWe define our same store population for the three months ended December 31, 2020 as the properties in our O&M operating portfolio, including the property NOI for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures at January 1, 2019 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2019 and 2020. We believe the drivers of property NOI for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the O&M portfolio based on Prologis’ ownership in the properties (“Prologis Share”). The same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period (January 1, 2019) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods.\nAs non-GAAP financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation of\nRental Revenues\nless\nRental Expenses\n(“Property NOI”) (from our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to our Same Store Property NOI measures.\nWe evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. The following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental expenses and property NOI for each quarter in 2020 and 2019 to the full year, as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income and within Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended December 31 (dollars in millions):\n33\nDuring the periods presented, certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). As a result, only line items labeled “Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI” are comparable period over period.\nWe manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our O&M portfolio at 100% as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. We calculate those results by including 100% of the properties included in our same store portfolio.\nOther Components of Income (Expense)\nEarnings from Unconsolidated Entities, Net\nWe recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method, of $297 million and $200 million during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars.\n34\nSee the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the Strategic Capital segment discussion and in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.\nInterest Expense\nThe following table details our net interest expense (dollars in millions):\nInterest expense increased due to higher debt balances in 2020 as compared to 2019, driven primarily by the issuance of senior notes and debt assumed in the Liberty Transaction, reduced partially by lower interest rates as a result of our refinancing activities as discussed under the Summary of 2020 section.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.\nForeign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments.\nWe may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. We recognize the change in fair value of the undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses. Upon settlement of these transactions, we recognize realized gains or losses.\nWe primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. We have issued debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and have designated a portion of the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge.\nWe recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses.\nThe following table details our foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net included in earnings (in millions):\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions.\nLosses on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net\nAs discussed above, during 2020 we issued $6.2 billion of senior notes, aggregate principal in U.S. dollars, and used the proceeds to redeem certain higher interest rate debt before maturity. This resulted in extending our weighted average remaining maturity to 10 years and lowering our weighted average effective interest rate to approximately 1.9% at December 31, 2020 and the recognition of losses on early extinguishment of debt of $188 million during 2020. The losses included the extinguishment of debt assumed in the Liberty Transaction and the IPT Transaction, which represented the excess of the prepayment penalties over the premium recorded upon assumption of the debt. During 2019 we recognized $16 million of losses on early extinguishment of debt. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, for more information regarding our debt repurchases.\nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recognize income tax expense related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries and in the local, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income, including\n35\ngains on the disposition and contribution of properties\nand fees earned from the co-investment ventures\n. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries.\nThe following table summarizes our income tax expense (benefit) (in millions):\nOur income taxes are discussed in more detail in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nThis amount represents the third-party investors’ share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity, reduced by the third-party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period.\nWe had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of $135 million and $129 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in these amounts were $42 million and $47 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of Prologis, L.P.\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions and other comprehensive income (loss).\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nSee Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about environmental liabilities.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nWe consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.\nNear-Term Principal Cash Sources and Uses\nIn addition to dividends and distributions, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following:\n36\nWe expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions):\nWe may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions.\nDebt\nThe following table summarizes information about our consolidated debt by currency at December 31 (dollars in millions):\nOur credit ratings at December 31, 2020, were A3 from Moody’s and A- from Standard & Poor’s, both with stable outlook. These ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous interest rate.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity.\nA securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.\nAt December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. These covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt, encumbered debt and fixed charge coverage ratios.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt.\nEquity Commitments Related to Certain Co-Investment Ventures\nCertain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash.\n37\nThe following table summarizes the remaining equity commitments at December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nSee the Cash Flow Summary below for more information about our investment activity in the unconsolidated co-investment ventures.\nUnconsolidated Co-Investment Venture Debt\nWe had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, at December 31, 2020, of $6.7 billion. The ventures listed below had total third-party debt of $11.8 billion at December 31, 2020. Certain of our ventures do not have third-party debt and are therefore excluded. This debt is non-recourse to Prologis and other investors in the co-investment ventures and matures and bears interest as follows at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nAt December 31, 2020, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. In our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt. There can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. If the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. Certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity (in millions):\n38\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, was impacted by the following significant activities:\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from contributions and dispositions of real estate properties. Cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these activities. In addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash provided by or used in investing activities:\n39\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by and used in financing activities is principally driven by proceeds from and payments on credit facilities and other debt, along with dividends paid on common and preferred stock and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions.\nIn addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash provided by or used in financing activities:\nOur repurchase of and payments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt consisted of the following activity (in millions):\nDistribution and Dividend Requirements\nOur dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the IRC, relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities.\nUnder the IRC, REITs may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income.\nWe paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.58 and $0.53 per common share in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the Board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year.\nWe make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. The Class A Units in the OP are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit. We paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.64665 per Class A Unit in 2020 and 2019.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had 1.3 million shares of Series Q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of $50 per share. The annual dividend rate is 8.54% per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.\nOther Commitments\nOn an ongoing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nA critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity’s financial condition and results of operations. Management’s judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial\n40\nStatements, those presented below have been identified by us as\nmeeting the criteria to be considered\ncritical accounting policies. Refer to Not\ne 2 for more information on these critical accounting\npolicies.\nAsset Acquisitions\nWe generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition. We measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. Assets we do not intend to hold long-term are recorded at fair value. At a property-level, we allocate the fair value to the components which include building, land, improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases. The most significant portion of the allocation is to building and land and requires the use of market based estimates and assumptions.\nThe purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated NOI of a property. Key assumptions include market rents, growth rates, and discount and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. We determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary, based on the property characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. The use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and allocate the most significant portion of the property value between the building and land could affect the expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life.\nRecoverability of Real Estate Assets\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future net rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS (“FFO”)\nFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties’ share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.\nOur FFO Measures\nOur FFO measures begin with NAREIT’s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\nand\nCore FFO\n, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.\nWe calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.\n41\nThese FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nWe analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.\nFFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (“FFO, as modified by Prologis”)\nTo arrive at\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\n, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:\nWe use\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\n, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S.\nCore FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (“Core FFO”)\nIn addition to\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\n, we also use\nCore FFO.\nTo arrive at\nCore FFO,\nwe adjust\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\n, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in\nFFO, as modified by Prologis\n:\nWe use\nCore FFO\n, including by segment and geographies, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.\nLimitations on the use of our FFO measures\nWhile we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT’s nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of the limitations are:\n42\nWe compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP as follows (in millions):"

    "text": "We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange-related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes. See our risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors, specifically Risks Related to our Global Operations and Risks Related to Financing and Capital. See also Notes 2 and 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments.\nWe monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at December 31, 2020. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections. The sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value. As a result, revenues and expenses, as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period, hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. Additionally, we hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial\n43\ninstruments\nthat we designate\nas net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments.\nAt December 31, 20\n20\n, after consideration of our\nability to borrow in the foreign currencies in which we invest and also\nderivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in Note 1\n5\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements,\nwe had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, $442 million or 10.0% of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into other foreign currency contracts, such as forwards, to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency\nassociated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries. We\nhave forward contracts that were not designated as hedges, denominated principally in British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen, and have an aggregate notional amount of $1.2 billion to mitigate risk associated with the translation of the future earnings of our subsidiaries denominated in these currencies. The gain or loss on settlement of these contracts is included in our earnings and offsets the lower or higher translation of earnings from our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher translated U.S. dollar earnings from these currencies, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies by 10% could result in a $116 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. To mitigate that risk, we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt. At December 31, 2020, $14.9 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2020, $2.0 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates. The following table summarizes the future repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nAt December 31, 2020, the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 0.5%. Changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. On the basis of our sensitivity analysis, a 10% increase in interest rates on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances would result in additional annual interest expense of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which equates to a change in interest rates of 5 basis points on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances and 1 basis point on our average total debt portfolio balances."

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nLiberty Transaction\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on February 4, 2020 Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. acquired Liberty Property Trust and Liberty Property Limited Partnership (collectively the “Liberty Transaction”) for $13.0 billion and the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. In asset acquisitions, the Company measures the real estate assets acquired based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration is allocated to the real estate properties, excluding those identified as held for sale, on a relative fair value basis. The components of the acquisition include an initial allocation to investments in real estate properties acquired based on fair value and an initial allocation of that fair value to buildings and land.\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value allocated to investments in real estate properties acquired, including the allocation of the property fair value to land and building, in the Liberty Transaction as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the fair value amounts estimated by the Company in the allocation, which have measurement uncertainty, required specialized skill and knowledge. Specifically, testing significant assumptions of market rents and capitalization rates in relation to investments in real estate and testing the allocation of property fair value to land and building.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s fair value estimation process for investments in real estate properties, land and building. This included controls related to the determination of amounts allocated to land and building and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of investments in real estate properties. For a selection of investments in real estate properties we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in 1) comparing the Company’s determination of the fair value of investments in real estate properties to sales prices from available property sales, 2) comparing the Company’s significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of investments in real estate properties to available leasing information, industry research publications and inquiries of market participants, 3) comparing the Company’s determination of the fair value of land to sales prices from available land sales and 4) comparing the Company’s determination of fair value of building to developed ranges of estimates based on market data, such as industry guides used for developing replacement building values.\nAssessment of the Company’s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4, the Company had $43,508 million of operating properties as of December 31, 2020. The Company tests the recoverability of operating properties whenever events or changes in circumstances, including shortening the expected holding period of such assets, indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.\nWe identified the assessment of the Company’s evaluation of the expected holding period for operating properties as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the relevant events or changes in circumstances that the Company used to evaluate its expected holding period. A shortening of the expected holding period could indicate a potential impairment.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s recoverability of operating properties process including controls related to determining the expected holding period and any related changes. We evaluated the Company’s expected holding period by inquiring of the Company regarding changes to the expected holding period, considering certain factors related to the current economic environment, reading minutes of the meetings of the Company’s Board of Directors, reading external communications with investors and analysts, and analyzing documents prepared by the Company regarding proposed real estate transactions and potential triggering events.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nDenver, Colorado\nFebruary 10, 2021\n49\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Partners of Prologis, L.P. and the Board of Directors of Prologis, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Prologis, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Operating Partnership) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Operating Partnership has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842,\nLeases\n.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Operating Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Operating Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Operating Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nFebruary 10, 2021\n51\nPROLOGIS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n52\nPROLOGIS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n53\nPROLOGIS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In thousands\n)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n54\nPROLOGIS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n55\nPROLOGIS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\nSee Note 18 for information on noncash investing and financing activities and other information.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nPROLOGIS, L.P.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57\nPROLOGIS, L.P.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per unit amounts)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n58\nPROLOGIS, L.P.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n59\nPROLOGIS, L.P.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CAPITAL\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n60\nPROLOGIS, L.P\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\nSee Note 18 for information on noncash investing and financing activities and other information.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n61\nPROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nPrologis, Inc. (or the “Parent”) commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code” or “IRC”), and believes the current organization and method of operation will enable it to maintain its status as a REIT. The Parent is the general partner of Prologis, L.P. (or the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”). Through the OP, we are engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development and management of logistics facilities with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We maintain a significant level of ownership in these co-investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity. Our current business strategy consists of\ntwo\noperating business segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. Our Real Estate Operations segment represents the ownership and development of logistics properties. Our Strategic Capital segment represents the management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures. See Note 17 for further discussion of our business segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the Parent and the OP. The terms “the Company,” “Prologis,” “we,” “our” or “us” means the Parent and OP collectively.\nFor each share of preferred or common stock the Parent issues, the OP issues a corresponding preferred or common partnership unit, as applicable, to the Parent in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. At December 31, 2020, the Parent owned a\n97.35\n% common general partnership interest in the OP and\n100\n% of the preferred units in the OP. The remaining\n2.65\n% common limited partnership interests, which include Class A common limited partnership units (“Class A Units”) in the OP, are owned by unaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the Parent. Each partner’s percentage interest in the OP is determined based on the number of OP units held, including the number of OP units into which Class A Units are convertible, compared to total OP units outstanding at each period end and is used as the basis for the allocation of net income or loss to each partner. At the end of each reporting period, a capital adjustment is made in the OP to reflect the appropriate ownership interest for each of the common unitholders. These adjustments are reflected in the line items\nReallocation of Equity\nin the Consolidated Statements of Equity of the Parent and\nReallocation of Capital\nin the Consolidated Statements of Capital of the OP.\nAs the sole general partner of the OP, the Parent has complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the OP and we operate the Parent and the OP as one enterprise. The management of the Parent consists of the same members as the management of the OP. These members are officers of the Parent and employees of the OP or one of its subsidiaries. As general partner with control of the OP, the Parent is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the OP. Because the Parent’s only significant asset is its investment in the OP, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the OP are the same on their respective financial statements.\nInformation with respect to the square footage, number of buildings and acres of land is unaudited.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and are presented in our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. Intercompany transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated.\nConsolidation.\nWe consolidate all entities that are wholly owned and those in which we own\nless than 100% of the equity\nbut control, as well as any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are the primary beneficiary. We evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the entity.\nFor entities that are not defined as VIEs, we first consider whether we are the general partner or the limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments that are not structured as partnerships). We consolidate entities in which we are the general partner and the limited partners in such entities do not have rights that would preclude control. For entities in which we are the general partner but do not control the entity as the other partners hold substantive participating or kick-out rights, we apply the equity method of accounting since, as the general partner, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the venture. For ventures for which we are a limited partner, or our investment is in an entity that is not structured similar to a partnership, we consider factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners. In instances where the factors indicate that we have a controlling financial interest in the venture, we consolidate the entity.\nUse of Estimates.\nGAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we made are reasonable and appropriate, as discussed in the applicable sections throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported results.\n62\nForeign Operations.\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in the U.S. and Mexico. The functional currency for our consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated entities operating in other countries is the principal currency in which the entity’s assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated, which may be different from the local currency of the country of incorporation or where the entity conducts its operations. The functional currencies of entities outside of the U.S. and Mexico generally include the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Swedish krona. We take part in business transactions denominated in these and other local currencies where we operate.\nFor our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars at the time we consolidate those subsidiaries’ financial statements. Generally, assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are included in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n(“\nAOCI/L\n”) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain balance sheet items, primarily equity and capital-related accounts, are reflected at the historical exchange rate. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rate for the period and income statement accounts that represent significant nonrecurring transactions are translated at the rate in effect at the date of the transaction. We translate our share of the net income or loss of our unconsolidated entities at the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions of the unconsolidated entities are translated at the rate in effect at the date of the transaction.\nWe and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany and third-party debt that is not denominated in the entity’s functional currency. When the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss can result. The resulting adjustment is reflected in\nForeign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income, unless it is intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature or third-party debt that has been designated as a nonderivative net investment hedge and then the adjustment is reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment in\nAOCI/L\n.\nAcquisitions.\nWe apply a screen test to evaluate if substantially all the fair value of the acquired property is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination. As most of our real estate acquisitions are concentrated in either a single or a group of similar identifiable assets, our real estate transactions are generally accounted for as asset acquisitions, which permits the capitalization of transaction costs to the basis of the acquired property.\nWe measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis\n. All other assets and liabilities assumed, including debt, and real estate assets that we do not intend to operate long-term are recorded at fair value. At a property-level, we allocate the fair value to the components which include building, land, improvements, and intangible assets or liabilities related to acquired leases. Purchase price allocations for a business combination are recorded at fair value.\nWhen we obtain control of an unconsolidated entity and the acquisition qualifies as a business combination, we account for the acquisition in accordance with the guidance for a business combination achieved in stages. We remeasure our previously held interest in the unconsolidated entity at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize any resulting gain or loss in earnings.\nWe allocate the purchase price using primarily Level 2 and Level 3 inputs (further defined in Fair Value Measurements below) as follows:\nInvestments in Real Estate Properties.\nWe value operating properties as if vacant. We estimate fair value by applying an income approach methodology using either a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated Net Operating Income (“NOI”) of a property. Key assumptions include market rents, growth rates, and discount and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. We determine the discount or capitalization rate by market based on recent transactions and other market data and adjust if necessary, based on the property characteristics. The fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. At a property level, we allocate the fair value to land and building.\nLease Intangibles\n. We determine the portion of the purchase price related to acquired in-place leases as intangible assets and liabilities as follows:\n63\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities.\nWe estimate the fair value of the entity by using similar valuation methods as those used for the consolidated real estate properties and debt. We apply our ownership percentage to the estimated net asset value of the entity to determine the fair value of our investment.\nDebt\n. We estimate the fair value of debt based on contractual future cash flows discounted using borrowing spreads and market interest rates that would be available to us for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. In the case of publicly traded debt, we estimate the fair value based on available market data. Any discount or premium to the principal amount is included in the carrying value and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt using the effective interest method.\nNoncontrolling Interests\n. We estimate the portion of the fair value of the net assets owned by third parties based on the fair value of the consolidated net assets, principally real estate properties and debt.\nWorking Capital\n. We estimate the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities using the best information available.\nFair Value Measurements.\nThe objective of fair value is to determine the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). We estimate fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize on disposition. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels:\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis.\nWe estimate the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes.\nWe determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities. We determine the fair values of our interest rate swaps using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments. We base the variable cash payments on an expectation of future interest rates, or forward curves, derived from observable market interest rate curves. We base the fair values of our net investment hedges on the change in the spot rate at the end of the period as compared with the strike price at inception.\nWe incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect nonperformance risk for us and the respective counterparty in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we consider the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees.\nWe have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Although the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties, we assess the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.\nFair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis generally consist of real estate assets and investments in unconsolidated entities that were subject to impairment charges related to our change of intent to sell the investments and through our recoverability analysis discussed below. We estimate fair value based on expected sales prices in the market (Level 2) or by applying the income approach methodology using a discounted cash flow analysis (Level 3).\nFair Value of Financial Instruments.\nWe estimate the fair value of our senior notes for disclosure purposes based on quoted market prices for the same (Level 1) or similar (Level 2) issues when current quoted market prices are available. We estimate the fair value of our credit facilities, term loans, secured mortgage debt and assessment bonds by discounting the future cash flows using rates and borrowing spreads currently available to us (Level 3).\nReal Estate Assets.\nReal estate assets are carried at depreciated cost. We capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. We expense costs for repairs and maintenance as incurred.\nDepreciation and Amortization.\nWe charge the depreciable portions of real estate assets to depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the respective estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation on development buildings commences when the asset is ready for its intended use, which we define as the earlier of stabilization (\n90\n% occupied) or\none year\nafter completion of construction.\nWe generally use the following useful lives: 5 to 7 years for capital improvements,\n10\nyears for standard tenant improvements, 15 to 25 years for depreciable land improvements, 25 to 35 years for operating properties acquired based on the age of the building and\n40\nyears for operating properties we develop. We depreciate building improvements on land parcels subject to land leases over the shorter of the estimated life of the building improvement or the contractual term of the underlying land lease. Capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the estimated remaining lease term. Our weighted average lease term on leases commenced during 2020, based on square feet for all leases, was\n64\nmonths.\n64\nCapitalization of Costs.\nDuring the land development and construction periods of qualifying projects, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and general and administrative costs of the personnel performing the development, renovation and rehabilitation; if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to ready the asset for its intended use. We capitalize transaction costs related to the acquisition of land for future development and operating properties that qualify as asset acquisitions. We capitalize incremental costs incurred to successfully originate a lease that result directly from obtaining a lease and would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained. With the adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019, we no longer capitalize internal costs related to our leasing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we capitalized $\n21.2\nmillion of internal costs related to our leasing activities. Amounts capitalized prior to adoption were not adjusted and continue to be amortized in accordance with previously applicable guidance. Leasing costs that meet the requirements for capitalization are presented as a component of\nOther Assets\nand all other capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of the real estate assets.\nRecoverability of Real Estate Assets.\nWe assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable. This assessment is primarily triggered based on the shortening of the expected hold period due to our change in intent to sell a property in the near term. We have processes to monitor our intent with regard to our investments and the estimated disposition value in comparison to the current carrying value. If our assessment of potential triggering events indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to sell in the near term is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. We determine the fair value of the property based on the proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on quoted market values, third-party appraisals or discounted cash flow models that utilize the future rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates. The use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. Changes in economic and operating conditions could impact our intent and the assumptions used in determining the fair value that could result in future impairment.\nIn addition to monitoring for triggering events, we measure the recoverability of our assets by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. We estimate the future undiscounted cash flows and fair value based on our intent as follows:\nAssets Held for Sale or Contribution.\nWe classify a property as held for sale or contribution when certain criteria are met in accordance with GAAP. Assets classified as held for sale are expected to be sold to a third party and assets classified as held for contribution are generally newly developed assets we intend to contribute to an unconsolidated co-investment venture within twelve months. When the criteria are met, the respective assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciation is not recognized. Assets held for sale or contribution are reported at the lower of carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities.\nWe present our investments in certain entities under the equity method. We use the equity method when we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the venture but do not have control of the entity. Under the equity method, we initially recognize these investments (including advances) in the balance sheet at our cost, including formation costs and net of deferred gains from the contribution of properties, if applicable. The transaction costs related to the formation of equity method investments are also capitalized. We subsequently adjust the accounts to reflect our proportionate share of net earnings or losses recognized and accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, distributions received, contributions made, sales and redemptions of our investments and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If we conclude it is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the equity investment at fair value.\nWith regard to distributions from unconsolidated entities, we have elected the nature of distribution approach as the information is available to us to determine the nature of the underlying activity that generated the distributions. In accordance with the nature of\n65\ndistribution approach, cash flows generated from the operations of an unconsolidated entity are classified as a return on investment (cash inflow from operating activities) and cash flows that are generated from property sale\ns\n, debt refinancing or sales\nand redemptions\nof our investments are classified as a return of investment (cash inflow from investing activities).\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\nWe consider all cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. We invest our cash with high-credit quality institutions. Cash balances may be invested in money market accounts that are not insured. We have not realized any losses of such cash investments or accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk.\nDerivative Financial Instruments.\nWe primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest. We may use derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to both our foreign investments and the related earnings. In addition, we occasionally use interest rate swap and forward contracts to manage interest rate risk and limit the impact of future interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, primarily with variable-rate debt.\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Each derivative transaction is customized and not exchange-traded. We recognize all derivatives at fair value within the line items\nOther Assets\nor\nOther Liabilities\n. We do not net our derivative position by counterparty for purposes of balance sheet presentation and disclosure. Management reviews our derivative positions, overall risk management strategy and hedging program, on a regular basis. We only enter into transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk. Our use of derivatives involves the risk that counterparties may default on a derivative contract; therefore we: (i) establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize this risk and provide counterparty diversification; (ii) contract with counterparties that have long-term credit ratings of single-A or better; (iii) enter into master agreements that generally allow for netting of certain exposures; thereby significantly reducing the actual loss that would be incurred should a counterparty fail to perform its contractual obligations; and (iv) set minimum credit standards that become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial instrument increases. Based on these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.\nDesignated Derivatives.\nWe may choose to designate our derivative financial instruments, generally foreign currency forwards to hedge our net investment in foreign operations or interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments on variable debt. At inception of the transaction, we formally designate and document the derivative financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. We formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, the effectiveness of our hedging transactions. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures hedged, fluctuations in the value of the derivative financial instruments will generally be offset by changes in the cash flows or fair values of the underlying exposures being hedged. Additionally, the presentation of the earnings effect of the hedging instrument will be recognized in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges of our foreign operations and cash flow hedges are recorded in\nAOCI/L\n. For net investment hedges, these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments and are recorded in\nAOCI/L\n. This includes debt issued in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity that we may designate as a nonderivative net investment hedge. We compare the net equity available from our foreign investments first to the derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges followed by any nonderivative net investment hedges. If the total notional amount of the derivative and nonderivative net investment hedges exceeds the net equity available, that excess portion is considered unhedged and recognized in\nForeign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net\n.\nFor cash flow hedges, we report the effective portion of the gain or loss as a component of\nAOCI/\nL and reclassify it to the applicable line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, generally\nInterest Expense\n, over the corresponding period of the underlying hedged item. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument is recognized in earnings, generally\nInterest Expense\n, at the time the ineffectiveness occurred. To the extent the hedged forecasted interest payments on debt related to our interest rate swaps is paid off, the remaining balance in\nAOCI/L\nis recognized\nin\nInterest Expense\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nUndesignated Derivatives.\nWe also use derivatives, such as foreign currency forwards and option contracts, that are not designated as hedges to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the translation of our results of operations. The changes in fair values of these derivatives that were not designated as hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings within the line item\nForeign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net\n. These gains or losses are generally offset by lower or higher earnings due to the translation at exchange rates that were different than our expectations. In addition, we may choose to not designate our interest rate swap contracts. If a swap contract is not designated as a hedge, the changes in fair value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings within the line item\nInterest Expense\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income\n.\nNoncontrolling Interests.\nNoncontrolling interests represent the share of consolidated entities owned by third parties. We recognize each noncontrolling holder’s respective share of the estimated fair value of the net assets at the date of formation or acquisition. Noncontrolling interests are subsequently adjusted for the noncontrolling holder’s share of additional contributions, distributions and their share of the net earnings or losses of each respective consolidated entity. We allocate net income to noncontrolling interests based on the weighted average ownership interest during the period. The net income that is not attributable to us is reflected in the line item\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n. We do not recognize a gain or loss on transactions with a consolidated entity in which we do not own\n100\n% of the equity, but we reflect the difference in cash received or paid from the noncontrolling interests carrying amount as additional paid-in-capital\n.\n66\nCertain limited partnership interests, including OP units, are exchangeable into our common stock. Common stock issued upon exchange of a holder’s noncontrolling interest is accounted for at the carrying value of the surrendered limited partnership interest and the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the common stock issued is recorded to additional paid-in-capital.\nRevenue Recognition.\nRental Revenues and Recoveries.\nWe lease our operating properties to customers under agreements that are classified as operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, under the terms of our leases, the majority of our rental expenses are recovered from our customers, including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. Rental expenses recovered through reimbursements received from customers are recognized in\nRental Revenues\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income. We record amounts reimbursed by our customers (“rental recoveries”) as revenues in the period that the applicable expenses are incurred. We account for and present rental revenue and rental recoveries as a single component under\nRental Revenues\nas the timing of recognition is the same, the pattern with which we transfer the right of use of the property and related services to the lessee are both on a straight-line basis and our leases qualify as operating leases. We perform credit analyses of our customers prior to the execution of our leases and continue these analyses for each individual lease on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the collectability of rental revenue. We recognize revenue to the extent that amounts are determined to be collectible.\nStrategic Capital Revenues.\nStrategic capital revenues include revenues we earn from the management services we provide to unconsolidated entities. These fees are determined in accordance with the terms specific to each arrangement and may include recurring fees such as property and asset management fees or transactional fees for leasing, acquisition, development, construction, financing and tax services provided. We recognize these fees as we provide the services or on a cost basis for development fees.\nWe may also earn incentive returns (“promotes” or “promote revenues”) based on a venture’s cumulative returns over a certain time-period and the returns are determined by both the operating performance and real estate valuation of the venture, including highly variable inputs such as capitalization rates, market rents, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As these key inputs are highly volatile and out of our control, and such volatility can materially impact our promotes period over period, we recognize promote revenues at or near the end of the performance period. We generally earn promote revenue directly from third-party investors in the co-investment ventures. We include the third-party investors’ share of promotes in\nStrategic Capital Revenues.\nWe also earn fees from ventures that we consolidate. Upon consolidation, these fees are eliminated from our earnings and the third-party investors’ share of these fees are recognized as a reduction of\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.\nDevelopment Management and Other Revenues.\nDevelopment management and other revenues principally include development and construction management fees and are recognized as we provide the services or on a cost basis.\nGains on Real Estate Transactions, Net.\nT\nhroughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,\nGains on Real Estate Transactions, Net\ncollectively\nrefers to\nGains on Dispositions of Development Properties and Land, Net\nand\nGains on Other Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net\n.\nWe recognize gains on the disposition of real estate when the recognition criteria have been met, generally at the time the risks and rewards and title have transferred, and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. We recognize losses from the disposition of real estate when known.\nBeginning January 1, 2018 with the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, we recognize the entire gain attributed to contributions of real estate properties to unconsolidated entities. We previously recognized a gain on contribution only to the extent of the third-party ownership in the unconsolidated entity acquiring the property and deferred the portion of the gain related to our ownership through a reduction to our investment in the applicable unconsolidated entity. We adjusted our proportionate share of net earnings or losses recognized in future periods to reflect the entities’ recorded depreciation expense as if it were computed on our lower basis in the contributed properties rather than on the entity’s basis.\nFor deferred gains from partial sales recorded prior to the adoption, we continue to recognize these gains over the lives of the underlying real estate properties or at the time of disposition to a third party. If our ownership interest in an unconsolidated entity decreases and the decrease is expected to be permanent, we recognize the amounts relating to previously deferred gains to coincide with our new ownership interest.\nGains on Dispositions of Development Properties and Land, Net.\nWe present gains separately based on the type of real estate sold or contributed. We present gains on sales to third parties or contributions to our unconsolidated entities as\nGains on Dispositions of Development Properties and Land, Net\nwhen the property was included in our land portfolio or when we developed the property with the intent to sell or contribute.\nGains on Other Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net.\nWe present all other gains on sales to third parties or contributions to our unconsolidated entities of non-developed properties (primarily operating properties) and other real estate transactions as\nGains on Other Dispositions of Investments in Real Estate, Net\n. We also include gains or losses on the remeasurement of equity investments to fair value upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the transaction is considered the acquisition of a business and gains or losses upon the partial redemption or sale of our investment in an unconsolidated entity.\n67\nRental Expenses.\nRental expenses principally include the cost of our property management personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, property insurance, real estate taxes and the other costs of managing our properties. Beginning January 1, 2019, certain indirect costs, such as salaries and related costs for employees working on leasing activities for our properties are now expensed through\nRental Expenses.\nWe are also a lessee of land and office space under leases which generally meet the criteria to be accounted for as operating leases.\nStrategic Capital Expenses.\nStrategic capital expenses generally include the direct expenses associated with the asset management of the co-investment ventures provided by our employees who are assigned to our Strategic Capital segment and the costs of our Prologis Promote Plan (“PPP”) based on earned promotes. For further discussion on the PPP, see Note 12. In addition, in order to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale, all of our property management and leasing functions are provided by property management and leasing personnel who are assigned to our Real Estate Operations segment. These individuals perform the property-level management and leasing of the properties in our owned and managed portfolio, which include properties we consolidate and those we manage that are owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing teams to the properties we consolidate (included in\nRental Expenses\n) and the properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures (included in\nStrategic Capital Expenses\n) by using the square feet owned by the respective portfolios.\nEquity-Based Compensation.\nWe account for equity-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. We recognize the cost of the award on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period.\nIncome Taxes.\nUnder the IRC, REITs are generally not required to pay federal income taxes if they distribute\n100\n% of their taxable income and meet certain income, asset and stockholder tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Even as a REIT, we may be subject to certain foreign, state and local taxes on our own income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.\nWe have elected taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) status for some of our consolidated subsidiaries. This allows us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs. Many of the foreign countries in which we have operations do not recognize REITs or do not accord REIT status under their respective tax laws to our entities that operate in their jurisdiction. In the U.S., we are taxed in certain states in which we operate. Accordingly, we recognize income tax expense for the federal and state income taxes incurred by our TRSs, taxes incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions, and interest and penalties associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the Consolidated Financial Statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nWe recognize deferred income taxes in certain taxable entities. For federal income tax purposes, certain acquisitions have been treated as tax-free transactions resulting in a carry-over basis in assets and liabilities. For financial reporting purposes and in accordance with purchase accounting, we record all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair value at date of acquisition, as discussed above. For our taxable subsidiaries, including certain international jurisdictions, we recognize the deferred income tax liabilities that represent the tax effect of the difference between the tax basis carried over and the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets at date of acquisition. Any subsequent increases or decreases to the deferred income tax liability recorded in connection with these acquisitions, are reflected in earnings.\nIf taxable income is generated in these subsidiaries, we recognize a benefit in earnings as a result of the reversal of the deferred income tax liability previously recorded at the acquisition date and we record current income tax expense representing the entire current income tax liability. If the reversal of the deferred income tax liability results from a sale or contribution of assets, the classification of the reversal to the Consolidated Statements of Income is based on the taxability of the transaction. If the sale or contribution is of the real estate asset and results in a taxable transaction, the reversal is recorded to deferred income tax benefit. If the sale or contribution is the disposition of the entity that owns the asset, the reversal is recorded through gains.\nDeferred income tax expense is generally a function of the period’s temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes) and the utilization of tax net operating losses (“NOL”) generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets. We provide for a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if we believe all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated ability to realize the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred tax expense.\nEnvironmental Costs.\nWe incur certain environmental remediation costs, including cleanup costs, consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations, monitoring costs, and legal costs relating to cleanup, litigation defense, and the pursuit of responsible third parties. We expense costs incurred in connection with operating properties and properties previously sold. We capitalize costs related to undeveloped land as development costs and include any expected future environmental liabilities at the time of acquisition. We maintain a liability for the estimated costs of environmental remediation expected to be incurred in connection with undeveloped land, acquired operating properties and properties previously sold that we adjust as appropriate as information becomes available.\n68\nNew Accounting Pronouncements.\nNew Accounting Standards Adopted\nAccounting for Lease Concessions Related to the Effects of the Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) Pandemic\n. In April 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a Staff Question-and-Answer (“Q&A”) to clarify whether lease concessions related to the effects of COVID-19 require the application of the lease modification guidance under the new lease standard, which we adopted on January 1, 2019. For rent deferrals granted during the year ended December 31, 2020, we are allowing customers to defer rental payments until a later period than was originally contracted under the lease in exchange for a note receivable, and we are continuing to recognize rental revenue during the period. In accordance with the Q&A, we are electing to not apply the lease modification guidance to concessions that result in deferred rent as the total cash flows required by the modified lease agreements are materially the same as the cash flows required under the original lease and there are no substantive changes to the consideration. During 2020, we deferred approximately $\n23\nmillion of rental payments which represented less than\n1\n% of our total consolidated rental revenue for 2020. At January 25, 2021, we had collected approximately $\n16\nmillion, or\n98\n%, of the deferred payments due at December 31\nst\n, with the remainder due in 2021. If we grant concessions to a customer that modify the terms and significantly change the underlying cash flows of the original lease for the remaining term, we will account for these changes as a lease modification in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nReference Rate Reform\n. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority and other independent groups announced they intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. As a result, in the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR in debt and derivative financial instruments. Additionally, other global regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates (“IBORs”). Both LIBOR and IBOR are herein referred to as “IBOR-indexed rate”. In November 2020, the Federal Reserve Board along with various independent groups announced the potential for certain USD LIBOR tenors to continue to be published until June 2023. This change would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before disruptions occur in the USD LIBOR market, without the need to transition those contracts to SOFR.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) that provided practical expedients to address existing guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting due to the expected market transition from an IBOR-indexed rate to alternative reference rates, such as SOFR for LIBOR. We refer to this transition as “reference rate reform.”\nThe first practical expedient within the ASU allows companies to elect to not apply certain modification accounting requirements to debt, derivative and lease contracts affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These criteria include the following: (i) the contract referenced an IBOR-indexed rate that is expected to be discontinued; (ii) the modified terms directly replace or have the potential to replace the IBOR-indexed rate that is expected to be discontinued; and (iii) any contemporaneous changes to other terms that change or have the potential to change the amount and timing of contractual cash flows must be related to the replacement of the IBOR-indexed rate. If the contract meets all three criteria, there is no requirement for remeasurement of the contract at the modification date or reassessment of the previous accounting determination.\nThe second practical expedient allows companies to change the reference rate and other critical terms related to the reference rate reform in derivative hedge documentation without having to dedesignate the hedging relationship. This allows for companies to continue applying hedge accounting to existing cash flow and net investment hedges.\nThe ASU was effective upon issuance on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2020 and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. We have not modified any contracts to date however, we will evaluate any debt, derivative and lease contracts that are modified in the future to ensure they are eligible for modification relief and apply the practical expedients as needed.\nNOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS\nLiberty Transaction\nOn\nFebruary 4, 2020\n, we acquired Liberty Property Trust and Liberty Property Limited Partnership (collectively “Liberty” or the “Liberty Transaction”).\nThe Liberty Transaction was completed for $\n13.0\nbillion through the issuance of equity based on the value of the Prologis common stock and units issued of $\n10.0\nbillion, the assumption of debt of $\n2.8\nbillion and transaction costs. In connection with the transaction, each issued and outstanding share or unit held by a Liberty stockholder or unitholder was converted automatically into\n0.675\nshares of Prologis common stock or common units of Prologis, L.P., respectively, including shares and units under Liberty’s equity incentive plan that became fully vested at closing.\nThrough the Liberty Transaction, we acquired a portfolio primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including\n519\nindustrial operating properties, aggregating\n99.6\nmillion square feet,\nwhich are highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential in\nour key markets\n. T\nhere was approximately\n34\nmillion square feet of non-strategic industrial properties acquired in the Liberty Transaction that we do not intend to operate long-term. Depending on the expected hold period, these assets are either classified as\nAssets Held for Sale or Contribution\nor other real estate investments within\nInvestments\nin Real Estate\n69\nProperties\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we acquired an ownership interest in\neight\nventures that own industrial and office properties.\nThe aggregate equity consideration is calculated below (in millions, except price per share):\nWe accounted for the Liberty Transaction as an asset acquisition and as a result, the transaction costs of $\n115.8\nmillion were capitalized to the basis of the acquired properties. Transaction costs included\ninvestment banker advisory fees, legal fees and other costs.\nUnder acquisition accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to the Liberty real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. All other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including debt, and real estate assets that we do not intend to operate long-term are recorded at fair value as follows (in millions):\nDCT Transaction\nW\ne acquired DCT Industrial Trust Inc. and DCT Industrial Operating Partnership LP (collectively “DCT”) on\nAugust 22, 2018\n(“DCT Transaction”).\nThe DCT Transaction was completed for $\n8.5\nbillion through the issuance of equity based on the closing price of Prologis’ common stock on August 21, 2018 and the assumption of debt. In connection with the transaction, each issued and outstanding share or unit held by a DCT stockholder or unitholder was converted automatically into\n1.02\nshares of Prologis common stock or common units of Prologis, L.P., respectively, including shares and units under DCT’s equity incentive plan that became fully vested at closing.\nThrough the DCT Transaction, we acquired a portfolio of logistics real estate assets that consisted of\n408\noperating properties, aggregating\n68.0\nmillion square feet,\n10\nproperties under development, aggregating\n2.8\nmillion square feet and\n305\nacres of land with build-out potential of\n4.5\nmillion square feet.\nThe aggregate equity consideration of approximately $\n6.6\nbillion is calculated below (in millions, except price per share):\nWe accounted for the DCT Transaction as an asset acquisition and as a result the transaction costs of $\n50.0\nmillion were capitalized to the basis of the acquired properties. Transaction costs included investment banker advisory fees, legal fees and other costs.\nUnder acquisition accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to the DCT real estate properties and related lease intangibles on a relative fair value basis. All other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including debt, and real estate assets that we do not intend to operate long-term are recorded at fair value as follows (in millions):\n70\nNOTE 4. REAL ESTATE\nInvestments in real estate properties consisted of the following at December 31 (dollars and square feet in thousands):\nAt December 31, 2020, we had investments in real estate assets in the U.S. and other Americas (Brazil, Canada and Mexico), Europe (Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”)) and Asia (China, Japan and Singapore).\nAcquisitions\nThe following table summarizes our real estate acquisition activity, excluding the Liberty Transaction and the DCT Transaction as discussed in Note 3, for the years ended December 31 (dollars and square feet in thousands):\n71\nDispositions\nThe following table summarizes our dispositions of net investments in real estate for the years ended December 31 (dollars and square feet in thousands):\nLeases\nWe adopted the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 and applied it to leases that were in place on the effective date for both Prologis as a lessor and lessee. Our results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2019 are presented under the new lease standard. We elected the package of practical expedients and were not required to reassess the following upon adoption: (i) whether an expired or existing contract met the definition of a lease; (ii) the lease classification at January 1, 2019 for existing leases; and (iii) whether leasing costs previously capitalized as initial direct costs would continue to be amortized.\nAs a Lessor\nWe lease our operating properties to customers under agreements that are classified primarily as operating leases. We recognize the total minimum lease payments provided for under the leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our weighted average lease term remaining was\n50\nmonths based on square feet for all leases in effect at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the minimum lease payments due from our customers on leases with an original lease term greater than one year for space in our operating properties, prestabilized and under development properties, other real estate investments and assets held for sale or contribution at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nThese amounts do not reflect future rental revenue from the renewal or replacement of existing leases and exclude reimbursements of operating expenses and rental increases that are not fixed.\n72\nAs a Lessee\nWe had approximately\n130\nland and office space leases in which we were the lessee at December 31, 2020 and 2019, which primarily qualify as operating leases with remaining lease terms of 1 to\n89\nyears\n. Our lease liabilities were $\n487.0\nmillion and $\n471.6\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the fixed, future minimum rental payments, excluding variable costs, for which the lease has commenced as of December 31, 2020, with amounts discounted by our incremental borrowing rates to calculate the lease liabilities of our leases (in thousands):\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for these leases was 34 and\n33\nyears at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not include renewal options in the lease term for calculating the lease liability unless we are reasonably certain we will exercise the option or the lessor has the sole ability to exercise the option. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate was\n3.4\n% and\n3.7\n% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We assigned a collateralized interest rate to each lease based on the term of the lease and the currency in which the lease was denominated.\nNOTE 5. UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES\nSummary of Investments\nWe have investments in entities through a variety of ventures. We co-invest in entities that own multiple properties with partners and investors and we provide asset and property management services to these entities, which we refer to as co-investment ventures. These entities may be consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the structure, our partner’s participation and other rights and our level of control of the entity. This note details our investments in unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which are related parties and accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See Note 11 for more detail regarding our consolidated investments that are not wholly owned.\nWe also have investments in other ventures, generally with one partner and that we do not manage, which we account for using the equity method. We refer to our investments in both unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures, collectively, as unconsolidated entities.\nThe following table summarizes our investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities at December 31 (in thousands):\n73\nUnconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures\nThe following table summarizes our investments in the individual co-investment ventures at December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had receivables from NPR of $\n160.3\nmillion and $\n136.3\nmillion, respectively, related to customer security deposits that originated through a leasing company owned by us that pertain to properties previously contributed to NPR. We have a corresponding payable to NPR’s customers in\nOther Liabilities\n. These amounts are repaid to us as the leases turn over.\nThe amounts recognized in\nStrategic Capital Revenues\nand\nEarnings from Unconsolidated Entities, Net\ndepend on the size, operations and transactions of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures, the timing of revenues earned through promotes and transactional fees, as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and our ownership interest. We recognized\nStrategic Capital Expenses\nfor direct costs associated with the asset management of these ventures and allocated property-level management and leasing costs for the properties owned by the ventures.\nThe following table summarizes the\nStrategic Capital Revenues\nwe recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures (in thousands):\n74\nThe following table summarizes the key property information, financial position and operating information of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures (not our proportionate share) and the amounts we recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures at December 31 and for the years ended December 31 (dollars and square feet in millions):\nEquity Commitments Related to Certain Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures\nCertain unconsolidated co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. Our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. We may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash. The contributions are generally used for the acquisition or development of properties but may be used for the repayment of debt or other general uses. The venture may obtain financing for the acquisition of properties and therefore the acquisition price of additional investments that the venture could make may be more than the equity commitment. Depending on market conditions, the investment objectives of the ventures, our liquidity needs and other factors, we may make additional contributions of properties or additional cash investments in these ventures.\nAt December 31, 2020, our outstanding equity commitments were $\n346.2\nmillion, primarily for Prologis China Logistics Venture.\nThe equity commitments expire from\n2021\nto\n2028\nif they have not been previously called.\n75\nNOTE 6. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR CONTRIBUTION\nWe had investments in certain real estate properties that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale or contribution at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At the time of classification, these properties were expected to be sold to third parties or were recently stabilized and expected to be contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures within twelve months. The amounts included in\nAssets Held for Sale or Contribution\nrepresented real estate investment balances and the related assets and liabilities for each property.\nAssets held for sale or contribution, including certain properties acquired through the Liberty Transaction and the IPT Transaction, consisted of the following at December 31 (dollars and square feet in thousands):\nNOTE 7. OTHER ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES\nThe following table summarizes our other assets, net of amortization and depreciation, if applicable, at December 31 (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes our other liabilities, net of amortization, if applicable, at December 31 (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes the expected future amortization of leasing commissions and forgone rent (included in acquired lease intangibles above) into amortization expense and above and below market leases (included in acquired lease intangibles above) and rent leveling net assets into rental revenues, all based on the balances at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n76\nNOTE 8. DEBT\nAll debt is incurred by the OP or its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe following table summarizes our debt at December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nCredit Facilities\nWe have a global senior credit facility (the “Global Facility”) under which we may draw in British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, euro, Japanese yen,\nMexican pesos\nand U.S. dollars on a revolving basis up to $\n3.5\nbillion (subject to currency fluctuations).\nPricing under the Global Facility, including the spread over LIBOR, facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based on the public debt ratings of the OP. The Global Facility is scheduled to mature in\nJanuary 2023\n; however, we may extend the maturity date for six months on two occasions, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of extension fees. We have the ability to increase the Global Facility to $\n4.5\nbillion, subject to currency fluctuations and obtaining additional lender commitments.\nWe also have a Japanese yen revolver (the “Revolver”) that we upsized in July 2020 with total commitments of ¥\n55.0\nbillion ($\n533.6\nmillion at December 31, 2020). We have the ability to increase the borrowing capacity of the Revolver to ¥\n75.0\nbillion ($\n727.6\nmillion at December 31, 2020), subject to obtaining additional lender commitments. Pricing under the Revolver, including the spread over Yen LIBOR, facility fees and letter of credit fees, varies based on the public debt ratings of the OP. At December 31, 2020, the Revolver is scheduled to mature in\nJuly 2024\n; however, we may extend the maturity date for one year, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and payment of extension fees.\nWe refer to the Global Facility and the Revolver, collectively, as our “Credit Facilities.”\n77\nLiquidity\nThe following table summarizes information about our available liquidity (dollars in millions):\nSenior Notes\nThe senior notes are unsecured and our obligations are effectively subordinated in certain respects to any of our debt that is secured by a lien on real property, to the extent of the value of such real property. The senior notes require interest payments be made quarterly, semi-annually or annually. The majority of the senior notes are redeemable at any time at our option, subject to certain prepayment penalties. Such repurchase and other terms are governed by the provisions of indenture agreements, various note purchase agreements or trust deeds.\nThe following table summarizes the issuances and redemptions of senior notes during 2020 (principal in thousands):\n78\nIn February 2020, we completed an exchange offer for\ntwo\nseries of Liberty’s senior notes for an aggregate amount of $\n750.0\nmillion, with $\n689.8\nmillion, or\n92\n%, of the aggregate principal amount being validly tendered for exchange. These senior notes are in the aggregate principal amounts of $\n400.0\nmillion due in\nOctober 2026\nwith an interest rate of\n3.3\n% and $\n350.0\nmillion due in\nFebruary 2029\nwith an interest rate of\n4.4\n%. The senior notes were exchanged for notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary and guaranteed by the OP. As a result of the exchange offer, we have no separate remaining financial reporting obligations or financial covenants associated with the senior notes assumed in the Liberty Transaction. All other terms of the exchanged Liberty senior notes remained substantially the same.\nTerm Loans\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding term loans at December 31 (dollars and borrowing currency in thousands):\nLong-Term Debt Maturities\nScheduled principal payments due on our debt for each year through the period ended December 31, 2025, and thereafter were as follows at December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n79\nInterest Expense\nThe following table summarizes the components of interest expense for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\nEarly Extinguishment of Debt\nOver the last three years, we repurchased or repaid certain debt before the maturity date in an effort to reduce our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities. As a result, the difference between the recorded debt (including premiums, discounts and related debt issuance costs) and the consideration we paid to retire the debt, including fees, was recognized as gains or losses. Fees associated with the restructuring of debt that meets the modification criteria, along with existing unamortized premium or discount and debt issuance costs, are amortized over the term of the new debt\n.\nWe recognized losses of $\n188.3\nmillion, $\n16.1\nmillion and $\n2.6\nmillion upon extinguishment of debt in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2020 we issued $\n6.2\nbillion of senior notes, aggregate principal in U.S. dollars, and used the proceeds to redeem certain higher interest rate debt before maturity. This resulted in extending our weighted average remaining maturity to\n10\nyears and lowering our weighted average effective interest rate to approximately\n1.9\n% at December 31, 2020 and the recognition of losses on early extinguishment of debt. The losses in 2020 included the extinguishment of debt assumed in the Liberty Transaction and the IPT Transaction, which represented the excess of the prepayment penalties over the premium recorded upon assumption of the debt.\nFinancial Debt Covenants\nWe had $\n14.3\nbillion of senior notes and $\n1.8\nbillion of term loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 that were subject to certain financial covenants under their related indentures. We are also subject to financial covenants under our Credit Facilities and certain secured mortgage debt. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants.\nGuarantee of Finance Subsidiary Debt\nWe have finance subsidiaries as part of our operations in Europe (Prologis Euro Finance LLC), Japan (Prologis Yen Finance LLC) and the U.K. (Prologis Sterling Finance LLC) in order to mitigate our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest. These entities are\n100\n% indirectly owned by the OP and all unsecured debt issued or to be issued by each entity is or will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the OP. There are no restrictions or limits on the OP’s ability to obtain funds from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan. In reliance on Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, the separate financial statements of Prologis Euro Finance LLC, Prologis Yen Finance LLC and Prologis Sterling Finance LLC are not provided.\nNOTE 9. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY OF PROLOGIS, INC.\nShares Authorized\nIn 2020, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation that increased the number of authorized shares from\n1.0\nbillion to\n2.0\nbillion shares of common stock. At December 31, 2020,\n2.1\nbillion shares were authorized to be issued by the Parent, of which\n2.0\nbillion shares represent common stock and\n0.1\nbillion shares represent preferred stock. Our board of directors (the “Board”) may, without stockholder approval, classify or reclassify any unissued shares of our stock from time to time by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of such shares.\n80\nCommon Stock\nIn 2020, we entered into a new at-the-market program that allows us to sell up to $\n1.5\nbillion in aggregate gross sales proceeds of shares of common stock through\ntwenty\ndesignated agents. These agents earn a fee of up to\n2\n% of the gross sales price per share of common stock as agreed to on a transaction-by-transaction basis. We have\nno\nt issued any shares of common stock under this new program.\nOn February 4, 2020, we issued\n106.7\nmillion common shares in the Liberty Transaction.\nOn August 22, 2018, we issued\n96.2\nmillion common shares in the DCT Transaction. See Note 3 for more detail on these transactions.\nUnder the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan, certain of our employees and outside directors are able to participate in equity-based compensation plans. See Note 12 for additional information on equity-based compensation plans.\nShare Purchase Program\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new share purchase program for the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate purchase price of up to $\n1.0\nbillion. In 2020, we repurchased and retired\n0.5\nmillion shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $\n34.8\nmillion at a weighted average price of $\n64.66\nper share on the open market.\nPreferred Stock\nIn 2020, we repurchased approximately\n0.1\nmillion shares of Series Q preferred stock and recognized a loss of $\n2.3\nmillion, which primarily represented the difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred stock, net of original issuance costs.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019 our Series Q preferred stock outstanding had a dividend rate of\n8.54\n% and will be redeemable at our option on or after November 13, 2026. Holders have, subject to certain conditions, limited voting rights and all holders are entitled to receive cumulative preferential dividends based on liquidation preference. The dividends are payable quarterly when, and if, they have been declared by the Board, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends.\nOwnership Restrictions\nFor us to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals may not own more than\n50\n% of the value of our outstanding stock at any time during the last half of our taxable year. Therefore, our charter restricts beneficial ownership (or ownership generally attributed to a person under the REIT rules), by a person, or persons acting as a group, of issued and outstanding common and preferred stock that would cause that person to own or be deemed to own more than\n9.8\n% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our issued and outstanding capital stock. Furthermore, subject to certain exceptions, no person shall at any time directly or indirectly acquire ownership of more than\n25\n% of any of the preferred stock. These provisions assist us in protecting and preserving our REIT status and protect the interests of stockholders in takeover transactions by preventing the acquisition of a substantial block of outstanding shares of stock.\nShares of stock owned by a person or group of people in excess of these limits are subject to redemption by us. The provision does not apply where a majority of the Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, waives such limit after determining that our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes will not be jeopardized.\nDividends\nTo comply with the REIT requirements of the IRC, we are generally required to make common and preferred stock dividends (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders in amounts that together at least equal (i) the sum of (a)\n90\n% of our “REIT taxable income” computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains and (b) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (ii) certain excess noncash income. Our common stock distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow that ensures that we will meet the distribution requirements of the IRC and that allows us to also retain cash to meet other needs, such as capital improvements and other investment activities.\nThe taxability of our dividends for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented below. The taxability of dividends paid in 2020 was based on management’s estimates as our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2020 has not been filed. As the statute of limitations is generally three years, our tax returns for certain years remain subject to examination and consequently the taxability of the dividends is subject to change.\n81\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid all of our dividends in cash.\nThe following summarizes the taxability of our common and preferred stock dividends for the years ended December 31:\nCommon stock dividends are characterized for federal income tax purposes as ordinary income, qualified dividend, capital gains, non-taxable return of capital or a combination of the four. Common stock dividends that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits (calculated for tax purposes) constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend and generally reduce the stockholder’s basis in the common stock. To the extent that a dividend exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s basis in the common stock, it will generally be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s common stock. At the beginning of each year, we notify our stockholders of the taxability of the common stock dividends paid during the preceding year.\nPursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.\nNOTE 10. PARTNERS’ CAPITAL OF PROLOGIS, L.P.\nDistributions paid on the common limited partnership units, and the taxability of those distributions, are similar to dividends paid on the Parent’s common stock disclosed above.\nOn February 4, 2020, we issued\n2.3\nmillion common limited partnership units in the OP in the Liberty Transaction. On August 22, 2018, we issued\n3.6\nmillion common limited partnership units in the OP in the DCT Transaction. See Note 3 for more detail on these transactions.\nWe issued Class A Units in the OP through an acquisition of a portfolio of properties in 2015. The Class A Units generally have the same rights as the existing common limited partnership units of the OP, except that the Class A Units are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $\n0.64665\nper unit so long as the common limited partnership units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $\n0.40\nper unit (in the event the common limited partnership units receive a quarterly distribution of less than $0.40 per unit, the Class A Unit distribution would be reduced by a proportionate amount). Class A Units are convertible into common limited partnership units at an initial conversion rate of one-for-one. The conversion rate will be increased or decreased to the extent that, at the time of conversion, the net present value of the distributions paid with respect to the Class A Units are less or more than the distributions paid on common limited partnership units from the time of issuance of the Class A Units until the time of conversion. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Class A Units were convertible into\n8.0\nmillion and\n8.1\nmillion common limited partnership units, respectively. The OP may redeem the Class A Units at any time after October 7, 2025, for an amount in cash equal to the then-current number of the common limited partnership units into which the Class A Units are convertible, multiplied by $\n43.11\n, subject to the holders’ right to convert the Class A Units into common limited partnership units. Dividends paid to the Class A Units were $\n2.58660\nannually during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNOTE 11. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nPrologis, L.P.\nWe report noncontrolling interests related to several entities we consolidate but of which we do not own 100% of the equity. These entities include two real estate partnerships that have issued limited partnership units to third parties. Depending on the specific partnership agreements, these limited partnership units are redeemable for cash or, at our option, into shares of the Parent’s common stock, generally at a rate of\none share of common stock to one limited partnership unit\n. We also consolidate certain entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity but the equity of these entities is not exchangeable into our common stock.\n82\nAs discussed in Note 1, the Parent has complete responsibility, power and discretion in the day-to-day management of the OP. The Parent, through its majority interest, has the right to receive benefits from and incur losses of the OP. In addition, the OP does not have either substantive liquidation rights or substantive kick-out rights without cause or substantive participating rights that could be exercised by a simple majority of noncontrolling interests. The absence of such rights renders the OP as a VIE. Accordingly, the Parent is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the OP.\nPrologis, Inc.\nThe noncontrolling interests of the Parent include the noncontrolling interests described above for the OP, as well as the limited partnership units in the OP that are not owned by the Parent. The outstanding limited partnership units receive quarterly cash distributions equal to the quarterly dividends paid on our common stock pursuant to the terms of the applicable partnership agreements.\nThe following table summarizes our ownership percentages and noncontrolling interests and the consolidated entities’ total assets and total liabilities at December 31 (dollars in thousands):\nNOTE 12. LONG-TERM COMPENSATION\n2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nIn 2020, our stockholders approved the 2020 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2020 LTIP”), which replaced the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2012 LTIP”). After approval of the 2020 LTIP, no further awards could be made under the 2012 LTIP and outstanding awards previously granted under the 2012 LTIP will remain outstanding in accordance with the awards’ terms.\nThe 2020 LTIP provides for grants of awards to officers, directors, employees and consultants of the Parent or its subsidiaries. Awards can be in the form of: full value awards, stock appreciation rights and stock options (non-qualified options and incentive stock options). Full value awards generally consist of: (i) common stock; (ii) restricted stock units (“RSUs”); (iii) OP LTIP units (“LTIP Units”) and (iv) Prologis Outperformance Plan (“POP”) OP LTIP units (“POP LTIP Units”).\nThe equity-based compensation plans and programs under which awards can be made were not changed under the 2020 LTIP.\nAwards may be made under the 2020 LTIP until it is terminated by the Board or until the ten-year anniversary of the effective date of the plan.\nThe awards have been issued under the following components of our equity-based compensation plans and programs at December 31, 2020: (i) POP; (ii) Prologis Promote Plan (“PPP”); (iii) annual long-term incentive (“LTI”) equity award program (“Annual LTI Award”); and (iv) annual bonus exchange program. Under all of these components, certain employees may elect to receive their equity award payout either in the form of RSUs or other equity of the Parent or LTIP Units of the OP.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had\n34.2\nmillion shares reserved or available for issuance, including\n4.1\nmillion shares of common stock to be issued upon vesting of awards previously granted and\n23.5\nmillion shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans. Each LTIP Unit and POP LTIP Unit counts as one share of common stock for purposes of calculating the limit on shares that may be issued.\n83\nEquity-Based Compensation Plans and Programs\nPrologis Outperformance Plan (“POP”)\nWe allocate participation points or a percentage of the compensation pool to participants under our POP corresponding to\nthree-year\nperformance periods beginning every January 1. The fair value of the awards is measured at the grant date and amortized over the period from the grant date to the date at which the awards vest, which ranges from\nthree\nto\nten\nyears\n. The performance hurdle (“Outperformance Hurdle”) at the end of the initial three-year performance period requires our three-year compound annualized total stockholder return (“TSR”) to exceed a threshold set at the three-year compound annualized TSR for the Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) US REIT Index for the same period plus\n100\nbasis points. If the Outperformance Hurdle is met, a compensation pool will be formed equal to\n3\n% of the excess value created, subject to a maximum as defined by each performance period. POP awards cannot be paid at a time when our absolute TSR is negative. If after\nseven years\nour absolute TSR has not been positive, the awards will be forfeited.\nFor the 2016 – 2018 and 2017 – 2019 performance periods,\nawards (“Initial Awards”), equaling in aggregate up to $\n75\nmillion of the applicable compensation pool, were earned after the end of the initial three-year performance period as the Outperformance Hurdle was met.\nParticipants are not able to sell or transfer equity awards received until three years after the end of the initial period. One-third of the remaining compensation pool in excess of the $\n75\nmillion aggregate initial award amounts can be earned at the end of each of the\nthree years\nfollowing the end of the initial three-year performance period if our performance meets or exceeds the MSCI US REIT Index at the end of each of such three years.\nBeginning with the 2018 – 2020 performance period and performance periods thereafter, the plan requires an absolute maximum cap of $\n100\nmillion on the compensation pool. If an award is earned at the end of the initial\nthree-year\nperformance period, then\n20\n% of the POP award is paid at the end of the initial performance period and the remaining\n80\n% is subject to additional\nseven-year\ncliff vesting. The 20% that is paid at the end of the initial three-year performance period is subject to an additional\nthree-year\nholding requirement. In 2018, our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”) adopted the vesting construct of the 2018 – 2020 performance period retroactively for the 2016 – 2018 and 2017 – 2019 performance periods. The change in vesting did not result in a remeasurement event under the accounting rules.\nEach participant is eligible to receive a percentage of the total compensation pool based on the number of participation points allocated to the participant, or in the case of our NEOs, a set percentage of the compensation pool. If the performance criteria are met, the participants’ points or compensation pool percentage will be paid in the form of common stock, restricted stock units or POP LTIP Units, as elected by the participant. Annually, a participant may exchange their participation points or compensation pool percentage for POP LTIP Units. If the performance criteria are not met, the participants’ points, compensation pool percentage and POP LTIP Units will be forfeited.\nAt December 31, 2020, all awards were equity classified. The initial valuation was calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\nThe following table details the assumptions used for each grant based on the year it was granted (dollars in thousands):\nTotal remaining compensation cost related to the POP at December 31, 2020, was $\n50.9\nmillion, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development activities. The remaining compensation cost will be recognized through 2029, with a weighted average period of\n3.2\nyears.\nThe performance criteria were met for the 2018 – 2020, 2017 – 2019 and 2016 – 2018 performance periods at the end of the initial\nthree-year\nperformance period, which resulted in awards being earned in January 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the form of the awards listed below. See below for details on these performance periods (dollars, shares and units in thousands, except average price):\n84\nOther Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Programs\nAwards may be issued in the form of RSUs or LTIP Units at the participants’ elections under the following equity-based compensation plans and programs. RSUs and LTIP Units are valued based on the market price of the Parent’s common stock on the date the award is granted and the grant date value is charged to compensation expense over the service period. The service period is generally\nfour years\n, except for awards under the annual bonus exchange program. Dividends and distributions are paid with respect to both RSUs and LTIP Units during the vesting period, and therefore they are considered participating securities. We do not allocate undistributed earnings to participating securities as our net earnings per share or unit would not be materially different. The value of the dividend is charged to retained earnings for RSUs and the distribution is charged to\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nin the OP for LTIP Units in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent.\nPrologis Promote Plan (“PPP”)\nUnder the PPP, we establish a compensation pool for certain employees up to\n40\n% of the third-party portion of promotes earned by Prologis from the co-investment ventures. The awards may be settled in some combination of cash and full value awards, at our election.\nAnnual LTI Equity Award Program (“Annual LTI Award”)\nThe Annual LTI Award provides for grants to certain employees subject to our performance against benchmark indices that relate to the most recent year’s performance.\nAnnual Bonus Exchange Program\nUnder our bonus exchange program, generally all our employees may elect to receive all or a portion of their annual cash bonus in equity. Equity awards granted through the bonus exchange are valued at a premium to the cash bonus exchanged and vest over three years, excluding the NEOs. As our NEOs do not receive a bonus exchange premium for participating in the bonus exchange program, the equity they receive upon exchange for their cash bonuses does not have a vesting period.\nSummary of Award Activity\nRSUs\nEach RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock of the Parent.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020 (units in thousands):\nThe fair value of stock awards granted and vested was $\n45.8\nmillion and $\n36.0\nmillion for 2020, respectively, and $\n46.6\nmillion and $\n35.7\nmillion for 2019, respectively, based on the weighted average grant date fair value per unit.\nTotal remaining compensation cost related to RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2020, was $\n44.9\nmillion, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development activities. The remaining compensation cost will be recognized through 2024, with a weighted average period of\n1.3\nyears.\nLTIP Units\nAn LTIP Unit represents a partnership interest in the OP. After vesting and the satisfaction of certain conditions, an LTIP Unit may be exchangeable for a common limited partnership unit in the OP and then redeemable for a share of common stock or cash at our option.\n85\nThe following table summarizes the activity for LTIP Units for the year ended December 31, 2020 (units in thousands):\nThe fair value of unit awards granted and vested, excluding POP awards, was $\n105.1\nmillion and $\n69.3\nmillion for 2020, respectively, and $\n82.6\nmillion and $\n41.2\nmillion for 2019, respectively, based on the weighted average grant date fair value per unit.\nTotal remaining compensation cost related to LTIP Units, excluding POP, at December 31, 2020, was $\n128.8\nmillion, prior to adjustments for capitalized amounts due to our development activities. The remaining compensation cost will be recognized through 2024, with a weighted average period of\n1.4\nyears.\nOther Plans\nIn 2020, the Prologis 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) was amended to provide for a new matching employer contribution of $\n0.50\nfor every dollar contributed by an employee, up to\n12\n% of the employee’s annual compensation (within the statutory compensation limit). The matching employer contribution was previously up to\n6\n% of the employee’s annual compensation. In the 401(k) Plan, vesting in the matching employer contributions is based on the employee’s years of service, with\n100\n% vesting at the completion of\none year\nof service. Our contributions under the matching provisions were $\n5.9\nmillion, $\n3.0\nmillion and $\n2.9\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe have a non-qualified savings plan that allows highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer the receipt and income taxation of a certain portion of their compensation in excess of the amount permitted under the 401(k) Plan. There has been no employer matching within this plan in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020.\nNOTE 13. INCOME TAXES\nComponents of Earnings Before Income Taxes\nThe following table summarizes the components of earnings before income taxes for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n86\nSummary of Current and Deferred Income Taxes\nThe following table summarizes the components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\nCurrent Income Taxes\nWe recognize current income tax expense for the federal and state income taxes incurred by our\nTRSs\nand taxes incurred in certain states and foreign jurisdictions. Current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income. Taxable income incurred over the last three years was principally due to the following: (i) the contribution of real estate properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and sales to third parties; (ii) recurring and transactional fees earned; and (iii) taxable earnings from unconsolidated co-investment ventures.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized current tax expense of $\n5.4\nmillion related to the settlement of an uncertain tax position. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did\nno\nt recognize any expense for uncertain tax positions.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $\n100.7\nmillion, $\n62.1\nmillion and $\n60.3\nmillion, respectively.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe deferred income tax expense recognized in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to changes in temporary differences and utilization of NOLs.\nThe following table summarizes the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31 (in thousands):\n87\nAt December 31, 2020, we had NOL carryforwards as follows (in thousands):\nThe deferred tax asset valuation allowance at December 31, 2020, was adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that we estimate will more likely than not be realized.\nLiability for Uncertain Tax Positions\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we believe that we had complied with the REIT requirements of the IRC. The statute of limitations for our tax returns is generally three years. As such, our tax returns that remain subject to examination would be primarily from 2017 and thereafter.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $\n21.3\nmillion liability for uncertain tax positions related to acquisition activities. In 2020, we settled the $\n3.0\nmillion liability for the uncertain tax position at December 31, 2019.\n88\nNOTE 14. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OR UNIT\nWe determine basic earnings per share or unit based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock or units outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per share or unit based on the weighted average number of shares or units outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average effect from all outstanding potentially dilutive instruments.\nThe computation of our basic and diluted earnings per share and unit for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in thousands, except per share and unit amounts):\n89\nNOTE 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We may enter into derivative financial instruments to offset these underlying market risks. See Note 2 for our derivative financial instruments policy.\nThe following table presents the fair value of our derivative financial instruments recognized within\nOther Assets\nand\nOther Liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31 (in thousands):\nUndesignated Derivative Financial Instruments\nForeign Currency Contracts\nThe following table summarizes the activity of our undesignated foreign currency contracts for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except for weighted average forward rates and number of active contracts):\nThe following table summarizes the undesignated derivative financial instruments exercised and associated realized and unrealized gains (losses) in\nForeign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net\nin the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except for number of exercised contracts):\n90\nDesignated Derivative Financial Instruments\nForeign Currency Contracts\nThe following table summarizes the activity of our foreign currency contracts designated as net investment hedges\nfor the years ended December 31\n(in millions, except for weighted average forward rates and number of active contracts):\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe following table summarizes the activity of our interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges\nfor the years ended December 31\n(in millions):\nDesignated Nonderivative Financial Instruments\nThe following table summarizes our debt and accrued interest, designated as a hedge of our net investment in international subsidiaries at December 31 (in millions):\n91\nThe following table summarizes the unrealized gains (losses) in\nForeign Currency and Derivative Gains (Losses), Net\non the remeasurement of the unhedged portion of our debt and accrued interest for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe change in\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nin the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the periods presented was due to the translation into U.S. dollars from the consolidation of the financial statements of our consolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. The change in fair value of the effective portion of our derivative financial instruments that have been designated as net investment hedges and cash flow hedges and the translation of the hedged portion of our debt, as discussed above, are also included in\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe following table presents these changes in\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nfor the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements\nWe have estimated the fair value of our financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies we believe to be appropriate for these purposes. Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that we would realize on disposition. See Note 2 for more information on our fair value measurements policy.\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, other than the derivatives discussed previously, we had no significant financial assets or financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements. All of our derivatives held at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nFair Value Measurements on Nonrecurring Basis\nAcquired properties and assets we expect to sell or contribute are significant nonfinancial assets that met the criteria to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as detailed in our accounting policy in Note 2. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we estimated the fair value of our properties using Level 2 or Level 3 inputs from the fair value hierarchy. See more information on our acquired properties in Notes 3 and 4 and assets held for sale or contribution in Note 6.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values.\nThe differences in the fair value of our debt from the carrying value in the table below were the result of differences in interest rates or borrowing spreads that were available to us at December 31, 2020 and 2019, as compared with those in effect when the debt was issued or assumed, including reduced borrowing spreads due to our credit ratings. The fair value of the senior notes increased in 2020 due to the decrease in bond yields in the market as compared to the higher weighted average interest rates on our senior notes. The senior notes and many of the issuances of secured mortgage debt contain prepayment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that could make the cost of refinancing the debt at lower rates exceed the benefit that would be derived from doing so. We evaluate this on an on-going basis and have taken the opportunity to refinance some of our debt at lower rates and longer maturities as discussed in Note 8.\n92\nThe following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our debt at December 31 (in thousands):\nNOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Matters\nA majority of the properties we acquire, including land, are subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. In addition, we may incur environmental remediation costs associated with certain land parcels we acquire in connection with the development of the land. We have acquired certain properties that may have been leased to or previously owned by companies that discharged hazardous materials. We establish a liability at the time of acquisition to cover such costs and adjust the liabilities as appropriate when additional information becomes available. We record our environmental liabilities in\nOther Liabilities\n. We purchase various environmental insurance policies to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIndemnification Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements whereby we indemnify certain co-investment ventures, or our venture partners, outside of the U.S. for taxes that may be assessed with respect to certain properties we contributed to these ventures. Our contributions to these ventures are generally structured as contributions of shares of companies that own the real estate assets. Accordingly, the capital gains associated with the step up in the value of the underlying real estate assets, for tax purposes, are deferred and transferred at contribution. We have generally indemnified these ventures to the extent that the ventures incur capital gains or withholding tax as a result of a direct sale. The agreements limit the amount that is subject to our indemnification with respect to each property to\n100\n% of the actual tax liabilities related to the capital gains that are deferred and transferred by us to the ventures at the time of the initial contribution less any deferred tax assets transferred with the property.\nThe outcome under these agreements is uncertain as it depends on the method and timing of dissolution of the related venture or disposition of any properties by the venture. We record liabilities related to the indemnification agreements in\nOther Liabilities\n. We continue to monitor these agreements and the likelihood of the sale of assets that would result in recognition and will adjust the potential liability in the future as facts and circumstances dictate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Liabilities\nWe have issued performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit in connection with certain development projects. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire on the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n275.2\nmillion and $\n240.6\nmillion, respectively, outstanding under such arrangements.\nWe may be required under capital commitments or we may choose to make additional capital contributions to certain of our unconsolidated entities, representing our proportionate ownership interest, should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund development or acquisition costs, repayment of debt or operational shortfalls. See Note 5 for further discussion related to equity commitments to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are party to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that, with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not have material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\n93\nNOTE 17. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nOur current business strategy includes\ntwo\noperating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. We generate revenues, earnings, net operating income and cash flows through our segments, as follows:\nReconciliations are presented below for: (i) each reportable business segment’s revenues from external customers to\nTotal Revenues\n; (ii) each reportable business segment’s net operating income from external customers to\nOperating Income\nand\nEarnings Before Income Taxes\n; and (iii) each reportable business segment’s assets to\nTotal Assets\n. Our chief operating decision makers rely primarily on net operating income and similar measures to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing segment performance. The applicable components of\nTotal Revenues, Operating Income, Earnings Before Income Taxes\nand\nTotal Assets\nare allocated to each reportable business segment’s revenues, net operating income and assets. Items that are not directly assignable to a segment, such as certain corporate income and expenses, are not allocated but reflected as reconciling items.\n94\nThe following reconciliations are presented in thousands:\n95\nNOTE 18. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nOur significant noncash investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included the following:\n96\n97\nNOTE 19. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)\nThe following table details our selected quarterly financial data (in thousands, except per share and unit data):\n98\n99\nPROLOGIS, INC.
